# WMDecompose: A Framework for Leveraging the Interpretable Properties of Word Moverâ€™s Distance in Sociocultural Analysis

The WMDecompose Python library is introduced in a paper published in the Proceedings of [The 5th Joint SIGHUM Workshop on Computational Linguistics for Cultural Heritage, Social Sciences, Humanities and Literature](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/5th-joint-sighum-workshop-computational-linguistics-cultural-heritage-social-sciences), a yearly workshop organized by the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). The paper aims 1) to explain the analytic motivation for creating the codebase, 2) to describe the pipeline in plain English, without direct reference to code, and 3) to illustrate its utility with a small vignette analysis. Readers looking for a more hands-on introduction to WMDecompose can find a fully coded example analysis using simple IMDB data in the [IMDB_example.ipynb jupyter notebook](https://github.com/maybemkl/wmdecompose/tree/master/paper/notebooks).
