# wmdecompose

wmdecompose is a package for leveraging the inherent interpretability of Word Mover's Distance, which to date has not been enabled in any of the existing implementations of the framework. 

This package was originally published as part of the paper ["WMDecompose: A Framework for Leveraging the InterpretableProperties of Word Mover’s Distance in Sociocultural Analysis"](https://github.com/maybemkl/wmdecompose/tree/master/paper) as part of the [SIGHUM workshop](https://sighum.wordpress.com/events/latech-clfl-2021/) of the [2021 EMNLP conference](https://2021.emnlp.org/). Notebooks and scripts for replicating the paper can be found in the [paper](https://github.com/maybemkl/wmdecompose/tree/master/paper) subfolder of this repo.
