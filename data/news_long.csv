"&gt;&gt; Overall, all of North America is responsible for around 30% of global R&amp;D spending

&gt; Meaningless statistic. I'm talking about the US, not Mexico and Guatemala.

I mean, fair enough. You do realize that the percentage will not go up if I exclude those countries?

&gt; Fair enough, but Switzerland is a tiny homogenous country of 23 people.

What is it with you Americans and the word homogeneous? Also what does that have to do with anything? (not that I agree with you)

&gt; The fact is that when it comes to drug discovery, it is not even close.

So now you only talk about drug discovery? What happened to being the leader in *scientific research and it's not even close*? Moving goalposts much?

&gt; Not to mention that many companies may only be headquartered in other countries.

Same goes for US companies that do R&amp;D in Europe. I see no way to quantify that across the board other than looking at R&amp;D spending by country. A statistic that is meaningless according to you.",news

The people who have been here for decades get that we just want to live in the city in a place where we can afford, and they want the same.

"&gt; No, just make them not exploit their labor through minimum wage that would be livable.

You just said ""if you cannot afford to pay your employees a livable wage, you cannot afford to own your own business."" So by your own words, the companies shouldn't exist at all.

&gt; If they sink, they sink and in the meantime, those employees will be looking for other jobs knowing the company is going under. People in startups do this ALL THE TIME.

If better paying jobs were available this whole time, why did those employees get those jobs earlier?

&gt; See above, companies and restaurants go under LITERALLY every day. These ""job creators"" (read exploiters of labor) are literally a dime a dozen, CREATING jobs isn't hard, creating SUSTAINABLE jobs in a Capitalist framework IS hard.

If creating ""SUSTAINABLE jobs"" is **hard**, how can you claim that it's easy for those employees to find a ""SUSTAINABLE job""?

&gt; They're not fucking animals. They'll find jobs themselves and if there aren't enough jobs they will self employ or get loans/investors to start their own jobs.

So, why haven't they found better jobs themselves or ""start their own jobs"" already? If it's that easy, they wouldn't need the help of the minimum wage, would they?

Furthermore, are you really, actually claiming unemployment isn't actually a big problem and finding new employment is easy?

&gt; Literally the ONLY difference here is that you have to pay a livable wage. You keep asking the funny, incorrect questions though when the obvious one should be: ""how the fuck do these new business creators think they can afford to start a business if they can't pay their employees""?

First of all, the businesses clearly found enough employees to work on the previous wages, so obviously it made sense to start those businesses in those conditions. I don't know why you're asking a question answered by reality.

Second of all, I would love to be so spoiled as to think that asking if people could find replacement jobs is some a dumb question.

But in any case i'm glad we agree there are flaws in the wall. You mentioned earlier there might be solutions to those flaws. Can you name any possible solutions to those flaws?

The question has always been whether the cost of the wall is worth the benefit it yields. My position is and has been that it is not worth its exorbitant and ongoing cost because it will do little to nothing to stop illegal crossings because a) it is easy to defeat (either going over, under, or through it), b) the massive length of  the border would prevent the current CBP force from arriving quickly enough to intervene against any breaches to the wall, and c) the sheer high demand of moving people and material between the US and Central/South America makes the likelihood of breach attempts a given (people will attempt to breach the wall, and if the results against the prototype they're trying to deploy are accurate, they will succeed . . . easily).

That was already an honest conversation i was trying to have about the wall that Trump is trying to have built. But if you want to talk about better hypothetical options we can do that too. If i were designing a barrier, i would scrap the idea of making it one structure extending across the entire border. Instead, i would put heavily reinforced sections of wall (say 16ft. high concrete walls reinforced with rebar and manned by guard posts at 1-1.5 mile intervals with ground units for interdiction). I would place those portions of the wall at the places along the border that are most heavily trafficked and easiest to traverse, thereby diverting crossers ro the rougher terrain. I would offset those portions of the wall about 1-3 miles in-country from the border to enable CBP to round them up on US soil before they actually get to the wall. I would employ a lot more CBP officers (say a contingent of 14k officers dedicated to the southern border alone because that has two officers patrolling each mile on average with another 2k leftover to operate marine and air units as well as to provide relief support for turnover). For air power, i'd say use more drones outfitted with surveillance packages (maybe working with the air force to use some of the sorties as a training ops in some capacity, but that may be a nonstarter if there are Possee Commitatus issues, i have no idea). Coupled with those drones of course i'd have an expanded rapid-deployment helicopter fleet (little birds more so than blackhawks) to provide quicker intervention. In addition to the above steps, i would provide more extensive smaller equipment like NVGs, vehicles with long-range thermal optics, and similar. I think each of those measures on their own would be more effective than Trump's wall.",news

"&gt; We saw the same kind of fight over Obamacare which Republicans opposed for political reasons. Is that not ""representing the ideals of Republican voters""?

Except the ACA was based on ""RomneyCare"" and was the Republican solution to the American healthcare problem.  The 'individual mandate' was initially proposed by the Heritage Foundation back in 1989, and has been the go-to Republican proposal*until* Obama backed it.  Then they opposed it.  Not because of the bill, but because Obama was attached to it.  It was not a political stance, it was a personal one.

It's true that Trump is widely regarded as foolish and unlikeable by progressives and moderates, disliked personally, but again, if he put forward an openly liberal or progressive initiative, he would find political support from liberals and progressives *even though* they would continue to dislike him personally.

Obamacare is actually a great example of how the GOP's stance is not based in policy, but based in personal opposition.  The minute a Republican bill had a Democrat's name on it, the GOP rejected it, even though it was *their idea.*",news

"**I'm not advocating on this woman's behalf - just offering some additional info. Please don't come down on me like I'm saying the disposition of this case is appropriate - I have no idea, but it seems really light to me as well.**

There are some interesting things in the public records for this case (edit: *I originally linked the public court records, but because of the sensitivity of this case, I'm removing that link. You can find it if you really want*):

1. One of the officers involved in the investigation was also subject to a grand jury determination of the appropriateness of deadly use of force in [this unrelated shooting](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/hallandale/fl-hallandale-beach-police-shooting-20160522-story.html), and was ultimately determined to have acted appropriately.
2. Broward county's crime lab appears to have been the subject of significant controversy in 2016 (before this case) for [inconsistencies and/or bad practices](https://www.staugustine.com/news/florida-news/2016-07-09/broward-public-defender-questions-crime-labs-dna-id-process) in its analysis of DNA evidence. While I did not review the .pdf referred to in the prosecution's supplemental *Brady* disclosure, it may or may not have something to do with the reliability of the toxicology report in this case.
3. The statement of probable cause implies the defendant's blood was drawn for medical purposes 163 minutes after the collision, and that this medical sample was obtained for toxicology analysis via warrant. The amount of time elapsed from this particular collision makes determining the actual BAC more difficult. Most DUI attorneys are aware of the 'rising BAC' defense, and would make that argument. In this case, however, the BAC is sufficiently above .08 that experiencing a rise of that magnitude that far after a collision would be a remote possibility.

[Another article on this case](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-sb-judith-khouri-dui-charges-20180316-story.html) talks a little more about the charges and the circumstances of the collision.

This case was also charged about a year after the incident. This might connote either 1) a *really, really, really* long debate about which charges were appropriate between cops and the DA or 2) someone forgot to charge the case - the latter of these is extremely uncommon. In the case of the former, the debate would either be about whether felony charges were appropriate or whether *any* criminal culpability attached.

If any would-be sleuth out there *really* cares to figure it out, the Lauderhill police report number is 1703-4465 per the PC affidavit.

In 2002, the national oil company of Venezuela (which was nationalized well before Chavez's election), backed by the opposition, took the country's oil industry hostage just after Chavez was elected.

The Chavez government offered to hold a non binding referendum as a point of compromise, but the opposition ignored this. In the end, the oil strike was dealt with by Chavez firing all those in control who had organized the strike.

I think most people wouldn't reasonably say that a rifle with a 16"" barrel is any more deadly than a 15"" barrel (illegal), or that adding a vertical foregrip on a pistol (illegal) makes it any more deadly than one without. I think suppressors are ridiculously over legislated for being essentially a safety device, they are nothing like the movies and only reduce the volume enough to reduce the chance of permanent hearing damage over time. I think adding national conceal carry reciprocity would have zero effect on crime as well. most would probably argue background checks when done in a reasonable time frame do more help than harm assuming they are accurate. 

right now our biggest issue isnt adding more laws, its enforcing the laws we have, for example straw purchases. super illegal but even if reported most cop shops won't do much about it. they will say that it is the atf's duty, then atf will says it's the cops duty. store owners can only do so much to enforce the law if the cops or atf won't help. 

now regarding suicides, I think it's ridiculous to think just having a stationary item in your house would in any way affect your sanity. every study I've seen regarding it states an increase in gun related suicide but a decrease in non gun related suicide. so at the end of the day the tool is irrelevant. even so, counting suicides as general firearm deaths is a bit like counting abortions towards infant mortality statistics. kinda defeats the purpose.

"&gt; I gave proof that it is filled with pro slavery

No you didnt. What you and a few others quoted were verses telling slaves how to act in the face of adversity or their particular lot in life. Romans were the occupying force of the time. They were certainly not Christians. Christian slaves are never commanded or urged to revolt in violence. Remember Jesus says ""bless those who persecute you"".  Most slaves in the Roman world were prisoners of war. 

Paul does not condemn slavery itself outright for theological reasons, nor does he endorse it. He say that non christians are slaves to sin and that the Gospel frees a person from the inside out. He therefore helps the Ephesian slaves to see that they are freer than their masters if they work as willing servants and followers of Jesus Christ, and he helps the Ephesian masters to see that they will only know true freedom if they recognize that they have obligations towards their slaves because they are also servants and followers of Christ themselves. Paul refuses to short-change the Ephesian slaves with superficial liberty. He teaches them how to be truly free on the inside.

Paul, who was a slave, taught slaves to experience spiritual freedom whilst still slaves. When people saw the good and moral character of Christian slaves, they began to take Paul seriously when he argued that the slave trade was immoral (1 Timothy 1:10), that slaves should gain their freedom if they possibly could (1 Corinthians 7:21), that masters ought to view their slaves as equals (Ephesians 6:9 and Galatians 3:28), and that they ought to set them free at the proper time (Philemon 16). In fact, it teaches that the feeling of any kind of superiority in general is sin (Philippians 2:1-8). 

And this is just Paul who was a follower of Jesus. Jesus does not speak of slavery specifically but the root cause of slavery, a deeper human issue. The root cause of slavery is the root cause of many social ills; namely selfishness. ""Love your neighbor as yourself"" and ""do unto others as they would do unto you"" solves many human conduct problems, not least of which is slavery as well as many others.

&gt;“The Spirit of the Lord is on me,because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor.He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind,to set the oppressed free

Where as I am concerned with HOW MANY are killed. I think how they die is irrelevant. You're only using it as rhetoric to support a baseless argument that, what, being shot dead is worse than being crushed? How? Where's the metric there? There isn't one. Cause it's an emotion based argument.

"To everyone against it due to control of your body:

Consider you had a not really sentient, but hiveminded worm inside you. Most of the time, he's harmless. He just chills. Occasionally though, he gets hungry and starts eating parts of your body. A nibble of the liver here, a bit of muscle there, but usually not something that'll inconvenience you for too long. But he can be deadly sometimes.

Now consider that 5% of the times you touch someone, the worm had placed an egg on the part of your body that touched the other person. It burrows into their skin and hatches, causing them to have a worm. Usually if they already had a worm deterring shot, the egg will die, but occasionally it lives. And what if you touched a person who was a. an infant, b. an elderly person, or c. unable to take the shot because their body is too weak? Boom, you just spread the worm.

Now, what's the big deal? Yeah you could get an injection that'll kill him, but why? Its only 5% of the time. And he's normally harmless, right? No, you'd think, ""Oh god that's fucking disgusting, get this thing out of me and I'm so sorry Karen, I didnt mean to infect you too!"" (Unless she took the kids)

Now imagine a small group of people decide they don't mind the worm, and they think he can be sedated by putting on perfume. They decide the injection is harmful to you with no solid evidence, or evidence that has been debunked. They spread this false information far and wide, and don't care if they gave you a worm because you'll likely be fine anyway.

Remember that the worm is part of a hive mind? Well, they are able to notice this is happening, as they aren't getting removed as often as they were. More of them are getting away with being more violent more often. Eating more serious things. Nipped a vein here. Little bit of the heart there. They become more deadly. But the group that doesn't mind the worms thinks, ""This is normal,"" or, ""Well I haven't been affected!"" But people are dying. 

So, the question is: do we then force everyone to get rid of the worm? 1 injection and he dies, and you are now safe from future worms trying to infection you (almost all of the time.) Yes, the people want control of their bodies, but if we don't do something, soon worms everywhere are going to start killing lots of people. Do we respect the 1 person who doesn't mind his worm, or the possibly 5 or 10 people he killed with his worm via a chain reaction?

One good way to account for personal responsibility is to make people take an active role in their recovery.

"Sorry for the copy-paste, but I am seeing so many responses to this post with truly abysmal attempts at statistical analysis that I simply have to respond. Please do respond with any questions you have - I'll follow-up as soon as I can.

Let's start by laying out our knowns.

According to the article:

* 21% of searches led to arrest for white people
* 16% of searches led to arrest for black people
* 1.08% of whites encountered were stopped
* 5.02% of blacks encountered were stopped

According to the 2011 census, in London:

* 59.8% of the population is white
* 13.3% of the population is black

So let's start off with a population of 10,000 to make the numbers easy to work with:

Race:       | White| Black|Total
:--|--:|--:|--:
Arrested    |13.563|10.682| 24.245
Not Arrested|51.021|56.083|107.104
Searched    |64.584|66.766|131.350
Encountered |  5980|  1330|10,000

A lot of those numbers look pretty similar, don't they? Only two more searches out of ten thousand are for black people, after all. Seems fairly promising for stop-and-frisk to start with.

But in the interest of completeness, let's not forget the next step of normalizing the data to the same scales:

Race:       | White| Black|Total
:--|--:|--:|--:
Arrested    | 22.68| 25.20| 47.88
Not Arrested| 85.32|476.80|562.12
Searched    |   108|   502|   610
Encountered |10,000|10,000|20,000

Ah. That's a bit of a different story, isn't it?

Giving the police the maximum benefit of the doubt, it seems black people are just as likely as white people to need arresting. Yet they are five times more likely to be searched! That is... not good.

Even if you didn't care about the civil rights angle of all this, it's just plain *inefficient*.

"Everything that is countable also has a margin of error in the precision of the counting. There's no such thing as ""exact."" There's only close enough in preciseness for useful measure. 

Consider how you would count 50,000 (more or less) cardboard boxes containing plastic clacker toys. 

You have to: 

1. Count every single box. 

2. Confirm that every single box does in fact have the clacker in it, otherwise it's not a box containing a clacker, but just an empty box. 

In both of those counts you have MANY sources of error that can be introduced: 

1. Humans are not great at counting. Lose count, double count, miss one. 

2. Humans make transcription errors. Maybe the count is correct, but it gets written down wrong. And maybe the person entering it into the database reads it wrong, or makes a typo. 

3. Humans steal things. 

So, to get a highly precise count you'd need multiple levels of redundancy. Person A checks person B's work, and person C check's Person B. And you hope that they aren't all in on the heist, in the case of number 3. And you need this redundancy at every single step, because your level of precision is only as good as your weakest measurement.

But all you're doing there is adding decimal places to your precision. You aren't getting an ""exact"" number. 

Even in the world of counting and measuring where it really matters you're just trying for enough significant digits to make it so that the outcome is not changed with the amount of error involved, or that level of error introduced doesn't outpace the cost of more precision. If a bank note counter was 99.999% accurate (and precise) in counting bank notes, even counting $100 bills they'd lose $100 for every (on average) million bills counted, which means losing $100 for every $100,000,000. If the cost of a 99.9999% counter exceeds [($100 x frequency at which $100,000,000 is counted) / useful lifetime of machine] then it's not even worth being more precise than that. 

Even on REALLY small numbers it's very difficult to have exact numbers of stuff. If your boss sends you to the store to buy paperclips, and you tell him that the cost of the paperclips was $3, he can't know for sure if the paperclips were actually $2 and you're stealing $1 from the company unless he verifies it himself.

"&gt; Um... none of that proves that he was wrong, you realize, right? 

It does prove him wrong. His opening sentence (""Nah, back in the day this would have been entirely legal."") doesn't make any sense considering the article is about exploiting children over the Internet, which of course wasn't possible until the last 30 years.

No, I wouldn't. That's a straw man. The current age of consent throughout much of the US is under 18. By his logic, in 150 years people will be looking back at 2018 and saying ""They're marrying off their own kids at like 16."", when marriage under 18 is rare in the US (under 1%). [The source on Wikipedia](http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230?section=primarysources&amp;source=24) that OP is quoting lists age of consent in various countries in 2007, including 13 in Spain and Argentina, and 14 throughout much of Europe. Arguing there's a correlation between age of consent laws in a country and allowing exploiting children is an asinine argument.

OP's argument makes no sense, which is why he looped in marriage to begin with. Age of consent doesn't have any bearing on how people would view someone exploiting children. Many teachers today have been prosecuted for exploiting students over the age of consent, and even 18. So OP has to loop in child marriage as a way of making the adults at the time seem ""evil"": ""That means people legitimately got together and decided it was okay to marry their children away"".

You realize [Guaido] was elected right? To the National Assembly, and that articles 233, 333, and 350 were activated so as to legally grant him interim-presidential authority for the purpose of hosting new elections.

This all started when the United Socialists lost the National Assembly in 2015. The lame duck assembly stacked the Supreme Court with Maduro supporters before they left. The new Supreme Court invalidated four of the Assemblies seats to override the supermajority they had to oppose Maduro.

The Assembly says “hell no,” and the Supreme Court calls them in contempt, and assumes legislative authority for themselves. The Supreme Court then gives Maduro the power to suspend elections, and imprison opposition officials.

Suddenly, the pro-Maduro Attorney General has had enough, and says this is unconstitutional. So Maduro fires her, and calls for a new constitution and a constitutional assembly. By precedent, new constitutions are called for by referendum, not presidential decree.

The National Assembly is pissed. They boycott the election of a Constituent Assembly to rewrite the constitution. 75%+ of Venezuelans oppose this special election, and 78% believe it to be a dictatorial move.

So the Constituent Assembly is elected with between 11-20% by most independent analyses. Oh, and they take over the building of the National Assembly. One day they invite the National Assembly over, and tell them the rest of their vestigal powers are being assumed by the Constituent Assembly.

Maduro then calls a snap presidential election, bars a whole bunch of candidates from running, intimidates others, and starts a China-style social credit ID system that monitors voting history, and rewards food accordingly. He wins this sham election with one of the lowest turnouts in history, and gets sworn in before the constitutionally allowed date.

At this point the National Assembly activates Articles 333 and 350 of the constitution, ironically championed by Hugo Chavez. The first says that the Venezuelan Constitution is still in effect even if the current regime is not observing it. The second says that the Venezuelan people, of which the National Assembly represents, are not bound to support a regime in abrogation of democratic principles or human rights.

January rolls around, and they activate Article 233. This says that if the presidency is vacant, the National Assembly, being the elected body of the people, and appoint an interim-president for the purpose of holding free and open elections. Given Maduro’s unconstitutional actions, unconstitutional and fraudulent election, and his early unconstitutional swearing in, it was seen as him vacating the duties and constitutionally prescribed laws of the presidency.

The oil is just a bonus I'm sure

Sure, it would be great for global markets if their oil was under competent management. Instead, there are idiots allowing their infrastructure to dilapidate, firing technocratic workers and replacing them with unqualified loyalists, and a host of other mismanagement issues. Their oil industry is going, err, downward. Furthermore, market liberalization isn't conspiratorial. Look at the diversity of originating countries in the contracts awarded in Iraq for instance, and their state oil companies still retain the largest share in the industry.",news
"&gt;There is value in knowing when the civil war happened, who was president at the time, why it happened, and how it got resolved.

Interestingly enough, I was just talking with my wife about the civil way as an example while discussing these comments. I absolutely agree with you on all points, except when. To this day I can not tell you without looking it up, when the civil war happened. I can tell you a lot more about it than I was taught in school (which was barely more than ""slavery"") but not even the years. Mid-to-late 1800s is as close as I can get without checking. Even having just discussed it, 1860s-ish. If you want to discuss economic issues, race relations, et al I'm game, but I've got no head for dates. But apart from ""the South wanted slaves and the North wanted to abolish slavery"" which is reductive to say the least, dates is about all any high school cared to try and teach. Then Lincoln passed the Emancipation Proclamation and there was much rejoicing, until a Southerner shot him. Nothing about the conspiracy to shoot him. Most places don't even seem to bother with ""sic semper tyrannis"" and certainly not with the fact that, until that point, John Wilkes was far less famous than his brother, who had saved Lincoln's son's life shortly before.

Understanding history is absolutely important, but that does not seem to be what our schools are interested in. You can't convey understanding on a Scantron. I can understand all the things I need with the knowledge that it happened more than a hundred years before I was born, which is still far too recent for so much of it.

&gt;You’ve clearly got a gun fetish so I’m done debating with you. You’re psycho if you think learning gun safety is more important or even as important as learning history or math. 

And this is why gun related conversations never get anywhere. You've made an assumption about my stance based on two comments. I know it's based on two comments because if you'd gone digging through my history you'd find nothing to support it. I know you'd find nothing to support it because it would be hard to be further from the truth. We don't have nearly enough controls on firearm ownership. And claiming the founding fathers meant for us all to own all the guns we want based on 

&gt; A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. 

Is more absurd than this exchange has been. Incidentally, if you made it this far, and didn't jump to another conclusion because I quoted the second amendment I'd really like to know. I'd frankly be pretty surprised after you decided I'm a gun nut and said you're not discussing any further. Back on track, a well regulated militia is far from what we have ended up with. But we're here and we need to make the best of it.

I never said gun safety is as important as history or math. I absolutely never said it's more important. I said it's more useful than pointless memorization of things that many will never use, and I'll absolutely stand by that. If more people had access to the education you seem to have had I would be a lot happier with our school system. But if that were the case it wouldn't have been getting described as failing for at least as long as I've been alive. I honestly had a history teacher teach a class full of students that their inaliable rights are ""life, liberty, and property"". Most weren't even that good. They were coaches that put on movies or TV as often as they could get away with. Tests and quizzes were more than 70% questions about dates. Most of what I know about history, which if I'm being honest is worth something at least, I learned on my own.

But sure, dig in your heels, refuse to budge, and wonder why conversations about any kind of gun reform never get anywhere. No. I'm probably wrong on that last part. I'll make my own assumption here. It's probably the fault of people on the other side, who won't ever listen.",news

I hold my Deputies to the highest of standards to protect and serve the residents of our community. Unfortunately, a Deputy fell short to those standards. I was notified Friday of an incident involving Deputy Keenan Wallace. Deputy Wallace fired his service weapon that injured an animal while in close proximity to a citizen. I believe there were numerous opportunities to de-escalate the incident. Over the last 24 hours, at my request, Faulkner County Investigators have been working diligently to investigate whether Deputy Wallace violated any state law or our agency’s policies and procedures. While it appears no policies or laws were violated, I hold every employee within our agency to the highest of standards and will be forwarding the investigation to the Prosecuting Attorney’s Office for further review. As a result of the incident that occurred on January 4, 2019, in the Shiloh Estates Subdivision, Deputy Keenan Wallace has been relieved of his duties at the Faulkner County Sheriff’ Office. We in Law Enforcement answer calls every day that require split second life and death decisions. We strive to be right 100 percent of the time.

"&gt;This law doesn’t specify what safe storage is, and leaves it open for cities to make safe storage impossible to comply with.

The law doesn't care about ""safe storage"", only ""unsafe storage"". The latter of which it defines as ""stores or leaves a firearm in a location where the person knows, or reasonably should know, that a prohibited person may gain access to the firearm"".

This seems pretty clear to me.

Why did you think cities would come into this at all?

&gt;If reported in time and if the firearm was deemed to be stored safely. Which, like I said, is not defined.

No, only if reported in time from the point of discovery:
&gt;&gt;The prohibited person's access to the firearm was obtained
as a result of an unlawful entry, provided that the unauthorized
access or theft of the firearm is reported to a local law
enforcement agency in the jurisdiction in which the unauthorized
access or theft occurred within five days of the time the victim of
the unlawful entry knew or reasonably should have known that the
firearm had been taken.

This was also a backdoor gun store ban that forced all FFLs out of the city. But hell, let’s let Texas pass a mosque tax. All that’s being taxed is going to a mosque. You can still worship at home, if you want.

Reloading isn't *that* expensive. Two hundred dollars up-front for a basic kit, maybe? Not sure what you're talking about with .22, either, since from what I'm hearing you certainly can reload it. If you shoot a lot it's probably a good investment anyway, since even without taxes the price of ammo adds up.

Ammunition wasn't free to begin with, remember.

&gt;I’m going to need you to explain that more, because as far as I can tell they only support more gun control. Between Washington bills and Pelosi and Feinstein, they seem pretty serious about banning as many guns as possible. But I’m sure you’ll tell me Feinstein proposing an even more expansive AWB than ever before is just a coincidence, or that the fact that democrats in states keep pushing for more and more gun control doesn’t mean they support gun control like they used to.

To my knowledge, none of the bills getting any traction with the Democrats are more restrictive than the 1994 AWB. If you have an example to the contrary, that would be appreciated.

&gt;I think I was talking about the proposed magazine ban and AWB.

In which case, that never caught on and we're back to Democrats lacking significant support for such measures.

&gt;So why did Feinstein propose hers? Why is one proposed in Washington? Why is there a bill in Oregon that would enact purchase permits and limit them to at most two every 30 days? Why is there an AWB proposed in Florida? I don’t think you’re fully in reality with this talking point.

Are you asking me why legislators propose bills they know will fail...?

It's an interesting and complicated question, but in this case I think it can be brought down to the fact that a number of Democrats do indeed support such bills. The party as a whole largely does not, but this way supporters can get opponents to commit to doing so.

&gt;We already have multiple laws that prevent prohibited persons from acquiring firearms. Washington has had UBCs for years now.

In this sense, I believe there's something lacking in the social psyche of today's average individual that is causing suicide rates to rise.

Imo, it has to do with a kind of materialism (the philosophical definition).  Back in the day, you had something to fill that void which the notion of materialism inherently created.  For example, the philosophical views of spiritualism and idealism (which are often cited as direct counters to materialism) were more prevalent as a counter.  

Today's modern era lacks that, especially with the flash and unfiltered noise of social media dictating the values, truths, and conversations of our society.

Coincidentally, the last time suicide rates were this high was during the 80s - a decade regarded as highly materialistic in the philosophical and conventional sense (and one where Trump and his acolytes dominated).

that would violate the 1st 4th 9th and 10th amendments and article 1 sec 8. etc.. etc.. etc..

they lacked this authority. so like the muderer legalizing murder they ""just did it anyway""

that does not make it constitutional. that just makes it enforced.

so no. by definition amendments are not constitutional. VALID amendments are constitutional.

let me give you an example. you can't legally make an amendment to repeal the first amendment because the first amendment literally says you can't do that.

I’m aware of government insurance. I’ve been a homeowner in Florida for 20 years and I’ve had it before. When I said “you can’t get insurance” it was hyperbole. Private insurance companies that will write a policy near the beach are few. And you keep talking about flood insurance. That’s a rider. I’m talking about basic homeowners. And the comment I originally replied to is also misleading or incorrect in that it implies that government insurance (citizens insurance) is somehow cheaper because it’s subsidized. It’s not cheap at all and much higher than private insurance in a non hazard area. The subsidy just makes the insurance so it’s not astronomical. ,news
"Despite people likely calling for punishment, a public university can’t punish a student for simply being racist given the constraints of the 1st Amendment. For example, a fraternity couldn’t be punished for putting on a skit featuring blackface:

&gt; The involved Fraternity members appeared in the contest dressed as caricatures of different types of women, including one member dressed as an offensive caricature of a black woman. He was painted black and wore stringy, black hair decorated with curlers, and his outfit was stuffed with pillows to exaggerate a woman's breasts and buttocks. He spoke in slang to parody African-Americans.

&gt; It may be that the performances were crude and amateurish and perhaps unappealing, but the same thing can be said about many theatrical performances. We cannot believe that when Congress wrote out a special exception for theatrical productions it intended to protect only a narrow and limited category of professionally produced plays.
 
 &gt; The University certainly has a substantial interest in maintaining an educational environment free of discrimination and racism, and in providing gender-neutral education. Yet it seems equally apparent that it has available numerous alternatives to imposing punishment on students based on the viewpoints they express. We agree wholeheartedly that it is the University officials' responsibility, even their obligation, to achieve the goals they have set. On the other hand, a public university has many constitutionally permissible means to protect female and minority students. We must emphasize, as have other courts, that ""the manner of [its action] cannot consist of selective limitations upon speech.

When looking at a many years of service, about 40% of officers have no complaints over a five year span, about 25% have 1, about 20% have 2-5, about 10% have 5-10, and about 5% have many complaints, and 1%-2% tend to have well-known problem behavior, but are protected by union lawyers and by the other bad officers.

The officers likely to be involved in a shooting are also likely to be involved with other problems, including lying on reports.

I imagine the officers in the 85% percent, that I would call amazing cops, probably would have found ways to calm the situation before entering knowing there was a risk of an armed confrontation.  They would have not knowingly approached that way.

Criminals will take anything they can use to their advantage, whether it be drugs, guns, cars or women or children.
They will use things meant for legal and law abiding purposes to commit heinous and violent acts. Stabbings happen just as, if not more, often as shooting but I don't see anyone calling for a knife ban, even though sharp blades are made SOLELY for cutting or stabbing things.

Hunting is a purpose, self-defence is a purpose, state and federal protection and law enforcement is a wonderful purpose. Just because you don't like guns, doesn't mean they don't have a place in society.

What we need to do is crack down on criminals, convicted felons and the like. I think there should be weekly visits and searches of their residence. If they have any run ins with law enforcement, the law should be able to search them then and there. There needs to be more surveillance on the ones we know are capable of crimes.
Criminals are going to commit crime with anything they can get their hands on, whether it's a knife, a car or a gun.


 We also need more focus on mental health in children and young adults so the ones that need help can get it and we can start to move away from the stigma that you don't need to talk about your problems, you can just push them down and everything will be all right. We need to get down to the root of the problem, but blaming tools for the people using them is asinine.

You don't take away a fat person's fork and expect them to lose weight.

You don't take a gun from a criminal and expect him to stop commiting crimes.


So I'm sorry you didn't like my comparison, but please do not labour under the delusion that more ""gun control"" will solve any of the ""gun problems"" in America, or anywhere else for that matter. 

Make no mistake, terrible people have done terrible things long before guns were invented and they will, unfortunately, continue long after guns become obsolete, until society learns to fix and love rather than to blame and to hate.

"&gt; Oh, and try telling Botham Shem Jean that a rifle wouldn't have made a difference when a police officer shot him in his own apartment. Oh wait, he's dead. I'm sure he would have passed on that rifle if he were alive though /s.  
  
And you think they wouldn't have just opened fire back? You think more cops wouldn't have shown up and blazed his ass? You realize that having a gun = dead if you encounter a cop, right? Especially if you happen to have the wrong skin color. I really don't understand this reasoning when conservatives say this, but shooting back at police is suicide. It's far better to *not* have a weapon when dealing with authorities than to have one.    
  
&gt; Illogical reasoning  
  
You think people should be able to have nukes. I personally value the right to life of millions of people over the ability for idiots to have a big toy. We've accidentally almost wiped out millions with the extremely well controlled arsenal the government has. I can't even imagine what private industry and citizens would do if given access to that kind of shit. The right to life is a lot bigger than the made up ""right"" to own WMDs.   
  
I support the rights of capable and responsible people to own serious weapons 
(a lot more than what is normally legal now), but giving widespread open access to the public is moronic, and serves no purpose whatsoever. Humans in general are far to weak and stupid to have the shit we have today (see: the post below this one). The 0.00000001% chance that guns could actually be a deciding factor in determining the fate of this country does not feel like it's worth it to me.       


Oh, and just to close it off: The only people there is a risk from causing some kind of violent outbreak across the country is the gun nuts themselves.   
  
Oh, and the national guard exists, in case you forgot (which is sounds a lot like you did). You could completely ban public access to guns and it wouldn't prevent the people from rising up against an tyrannical government. It's not like what is or is not legal would even matter at that point.   ",news

"Everyone talks about it, as you do, but it's pretty boring. Fundamentally poor black areas have horrible gang violence, but the primary victims are gang members also.

To Jane Doe living out in suburbia, they don't actually have any on going fear of gang violence because they don't live in Compton or similar ghetto areas.

But mass shootings based on what is frequently right wing hate, school shootings or some nut job deciding to blow away family and friends (which often occurs at homes and with school shootings) happen ANYWHERE in America, at ANY time. That is why the majority of the population who don't live in heavy gang violence areas don't fear gang violence, but the massive majority of the population has an inherent fear of a random nutjob going on a shooting spree because that can happen anywhere.

If gang members were randomly roving the entire country doing drivebys completely and utterly randomly on any target then people would be equally fearful. In reality people are scared of the types of violence that occurs to people just like them, in areas they live in, hence gang violence in inner city ghettos has almost no relevance while mass shooters who attack the very schools their kids go to, or decide to go kill the family of their ex girlfriend which could be their own daughter, or who get pissed off and blow up or shoot up the office they or their partner works at, that is what they fear.

Bringing up a completely different violence that actually effects very few people overall (however badly it effects them) is just trying to ignore the relevant information.

This also goes the other way, gang violence gets less general press coverage because most people dont' really fear it but people who live in a inner city ghetto are terrified of being caught up in gang violence because that is the kind of violence that effects them.

"i could say the same thing to you in regards to googling ""why walls work"" and why it works for israel and why it works for turkey and over a dozen other countries that use walls.

People are saying ""let's use drones, sensors, and more agents"" but drones can only send agents, sensors can only send agents, and there can only ever be so many agents and they can't be everywhere.

The wall is everywhere it needs to be. It's like having an agent at every inch. And the plan is to have sensors on it too! So the few places where people try to get through/over/under the wall, the agents could respond and they'd have more time to get there (obstacles give agents more time as opposed to just trying to chase in the wide open)

It's common sense

As I said in another thread, it's very interesting to me that many of the people who are anti-wall are also flat out pro-illegal immigration and will be apologists for illegal immigrants all day, spouting on about how they deserve the opportunities and no amount of this or that will stop someone who's determined to see their child have a better life.....well gosh that sounds like someone who WANTS them to come in illegally

Your reading of it is wrong. How can you expect a militia member to maintain a nuclear warhead? Or an F-35? That’s where the interpretation of arms comes in.

"For the record - I agree with you about the TSA. It's a joke and needs to be fixed.  

The 4th amendment is an individual rights law - thats for sure.  It basically says the government in any form cannot search you without probable cause as you go about your day.  However, any time you voluntarily go into a government facility then you are not being forced to be searched but are **consenting** to a search.  You can always turn around and say ""I dont want to be searched"" and go about your day.  You do not have to fly.  Just as you do not have to go to a museum with all the screenings involved.  As part of your decision to do these activities and enter their facility you are allowing them to search you.  

It's important to see the difference.  One is an illegal search because without probable cause you cannot be searched.  If a police officer stops you and asks you to empty your pockets or what is inside your backpack - thats illegal unless he has probable cause (which some dirty cops can make up and do an illegal search).  In the TSA situation you are saying - hey I want to fly so I will go through this process (as dumb as it is) in order to get on an airplane.  You could drive, walk, take a train, private jet, all other manners of travel without consenting to a search.  Its not an illegaly forced search so it does not break the 4th amendement.

Is it necessary?  debatable.  Is it legal?  Yes.

"The vaccine prepares the body. Our immune system is magical, in a way. Imagine diseases as locks, and our immune systems as keys. Now imagine we have an unlimited amount of keys, because it's practically that. We can defeat any disease that comes out way. Assuming we don't die first.

Vaccines gives us a ""dead"" or ""deactivated"" version of the vaccine. Our body sees it as a foreign body, sends the immune system the message, and you may experience tiredness, muscle ache, basically symptoms of disease for a day or two, as your body dedicates more processing power to find the right key.

Once your body finds the key, it remembers it. For a long time. 

Fast forward to suddenly being exposed to measles. Welp, this lock looks familiar. Let's use this key. Oh no, it didn't work. Different strain. Different key. Crap.

1.  This review paper is from 2008.  Ten years is a long time in the biomedical sciences, and things have come around since then.  See, for example, from 2018:  

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6300318/

&gt; The present study found that the proportion of suicide attempts without a plan was higher for younger adolescents than for older adolescents, which might indicate that impulsive suicide attempts were more prevalent in younger adolescents. 

In other words, there may be different types of suicide (e.g. impulsive vs. planned), and those types may not be uniformly distributed across age, SES, gender, etc.  That is to say, it is incorrect to deny the existence of impulsive suicide.  But yeah, I may have been wrong to characterize *all* suicide as impulsive.  

2.  This paper isn't about suicide prevention.  Or suicide epidemiology.  This is a paper from a law journal.  I hope you understand that lawyers don't give a shit about preventing suicide.  They're interested in denying or proving liability.

3.  One of my favorite phrases is ""This is simply not true.""  I use it all the time.  But when you use it... you have to earn it.  You have to cite recent research.  From a relevant journal.  And you have to at least pretend that you did a responsible research review.  Make sense?  Otherwise you're just being a pompous dick.

With AR's there's a difference because when you fire on ""3rd Burst"", say on an, .223 chamberd AR, you can put 3-4 rounds on each target before switching targets. With an Semi-Automatic, you cant fire a volley that quickly.

Some automatics can be gassed up to 800 rpm, which can be a lot more deadly because shooting one bullet vs multiple.

On an Untrained shooter with a Semi vs an Automatic, theres a staggering difference. If you're trained it really doesn't matter what platform of weapon (automatic vs Semi).

"I'm using Apidra in an insulin pump now,  but used regular and lente insulin a long time ago. (Have used novolog, humalog and lantus as well over the years)  For many people,  including myself,  it's a one-to-one swap. One unit of regular works like one unit of humalog/novolog/apidra, but the problem comes with having to wait.  Regular insulin requires waiting a minimum of 45 minutes prior to eating,  whereas the newer insulins only need 10-15 minutes. It also has a lifespan of around six hours instead of roughly four like humalog/novolog, plus a tail that kicks like a mule if you're sensitive to insulin. That mostly means that you have to be vigilant about knowing exactly what you are going to eventually eat, meal prep hard,  or eat low carb enough that it wouldn't matter, Bernstein-style. 
Personally,  I'd only go back on regular insulin if I were literally dying, and it was my only option. My experience with regular was that,  if you mix it with something like lente insulin or nph, you get a situation where tiny mistakes, changes to your daily routine or even slightly different amounts of exercise can cause hours of cascading low blood sugars.  Fix one low only to have to fix another in an hour when your long acting insulin (that you took hours ago) peaks, fix that low only to have yet another because the tail of your previous dose of regular hit you.

Now keep in mind, this was 2012, and it is now 2018. But even in 2012, the US kept running the line that the PSUV was illegitimate. Plus there was [2002](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/03/why-us-dcemonises-venezuelas-democracy), when an opposition coup lied about protestors being shot by Chavistas in order to justify a military coup, that eventually failed due to lack of popular support. The US continues to deny involvement.

And in last years elections the opposition parties [asked the UN NOT to send election monitors.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-un/venezuela-opposition-asks-u-n-not-to-send-observers-to-may-vote-idUSKCN1GO2J0) While Maduro asked them to come, and they denied. It was then monitored by [multiple nations](https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/13849), who found;

""We the international accompaniers consider that the technical and professional trustworthiness and independence of the National Electoral Council of Venezuela are uncontestable.""

The opposition are sore losers, who are being encouraged by the United States of America. They deliberately encouraged boycotting the votes in order to create the appearance of illegitimacy. Opposition parties were not banned, but deregistered because they did not participate in the previous election, and Venezuelan law requires a new registration if you did not run in the previous election. **They weren't banned**, they just had to fill out the paperwork that makes sure they fulfill a set of basic requirements, the primary being proof that the party has the support of at least 0.5% of voters (not very hard for the big opposition parties).

"My point is that there are certain forms of home education that are marketed as ""homeschooling"" that are associated with higher instances of abuse.  The US has almost free rein as far as ""homeschooling"" goes in most states, ranging from legitimate and non-sectarian home education (special education needs that can't be met in public schools, accelerated curriculum, severe bullying issues, unschooling/home Montessori) on one end, to dominionist correspondence-schooling (which is often part of a general milieu of religiously motivated child abuse and neglect--one which is highly associated with coercive groups (such as Quiverfull) which have been known to recruit from within ""Christian homeschooling"" groups--and which borders in many areas on educational neglect if not outright educational malpractice).

I should also note to you that (at least in the US) [dominionist correspondence-schoolers have explicitly tried to lock out recognition](https://hsislegal.com/does_hslda_work_with_state_associations_and_support_the_autonomy_of_homeschoolers/) of [non-dominionist homeschooling associations](https://hsislegal.com/) (and thus effectively make dominionist correspondence-schooling the only legally recognised form of homeschooling).  HSLDA [explicitly does not list non-sectarian, non-dominionist homeschool associations](https://hsislegal.com/does_hslda_exclude_by_omission/).

This particular family has apparently been working very closely with HSLDA in particular (the same HSLDA that coaches parents on how to interfere with child welfare investigations--I posted examples).  HSLDA has been trying to get a legal precedent established such that the ""bad kind"" of homeschooling (where the only recognised form of ""homeschooling"" is dominionist correspondence-schooling, where abuse can be hidden and is often part of a milieu of religiously motivated child abuse and neglect, and where HSLDA is the sole accrediting body) [is the only legal form of homeschooling in Germany](https://hsislegal.com/hslda_destroys_german_homeschool_movement/).  In fact, it's actually arguable that HSLDA's actions pretty much have thoroughly wrecked the chance for any legal recognition of homeschooling (either dominionist correspondence-schooling or otherwise)--largely via [subverting much of the homeschooling movement in Germany starting in 2003](http://hsislegal.com/hslda_destroys_german_homeschool_movement/conflict_timeline_hslda_vs_smith/).

Most non-dominionist homeschooling associations tend to be in support of [responsible homeschooling](https://www.responsiblehomeschooling.org/about-crhe/what-we-do/), which specifically includes [some specific recommendations geared towards child safety and that children have educationally sufficient curricula appropriate to the educational/developmental level of the child](https://www.responsiblehomeschooling.org/policy-issues/policy-recommendations/) (among other things, requiring some basic criteria for teaching, persons who would be disqualified from working in a public or private school not being allowed to homeschool, basic requirement of a high school diploma or GED, basic record-keeping requirements including educational progress...very reasonable approaches that would actually allow not only non-abusive religious homeschooling but non-sectarian homeschooling approaches like unschooling and ""e-schooling"" via correspondence courses through a public school). 

HSLDA, on the other hand, has pushed for the complete deregulation of dominionist correspondence-schooling (and in fact [especially pushes for pretty much the undoing of the few laws in the US that actually work to protect homeschooled children from abuse](https://www.propublica.org/article/small-group-goes-great-lengths-to-block-homeschooling-regulation)--things like mandatory reporter laws, any efforts to establish a monitoring scheme for homeschooled kids to make sure they're gaining sufficient educational progress and that they were getting yearly medical exams, etc.) and [has actively praised parents who kept special-needs children and waterboarded them, another parent whose special-needs child died of shock after her parents failed to seek treatment for severe chemical burns who had 3 other special-needs children die--all of whom were subsequently found to have been abused, and a third family whose children were eventually removed due to extreme abuse including deliberately breaking their bones and depriving them of water](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2013/05/hslda-man-who-kept-children-in-cages-a-her.html).

There's also a particular reason I bring up the Convention on the Rights of the Child and HSLDA's efforts to fight ratification.  In cases of religiously motivated child abuse and neglect, kids who are survivors of that abuse can actually bring action against their abusers (and those who aid and abet the abuse) under international treaty.  (This has occasionally been used in sub-Saharan Africa in cases of children accused of being witches and subjected to religiously motivated child abuse and abandonment; in cases where local authorities have been slow to act, NGOs have brought successful complaint under the Convention.)",news

"You're surely not wrong.

Now set aside your victory and consider that auditing by the IRS is qualitatively different now as compared to the past. 

&gt;What happens is you have people at the very top being prioritized and people at the very bottom being prioritized, and everyone else is sort of squeezed out,” said John Dalrymple, who retired last year as deputy commissioner of the IRS. In 2017, EITC recipients were audited at twice the rate of taxpayers with income between $200,000 and $500,000. Only households with income above $1 million were examined at significantly higher rates.

[one of the first articles I found when I googled, ""IRS audits the poor"" ](https://www.propublica.org/article/earned-income-tax-credit-irs-audit-working-poor)


So again, you are presumed correct that they cherry picked data to support their point.

But they are correct, that people are more likely to get away with stuff (in certain segments of society) due to the real and substantial changes in the way the IRS allocates it's money.

My point is it's not just audits that are hampered. But also collection. The IRS considers a  high income nonfiling individual a collection issue, especially when it's not a simple w2/1099 recipient. Take for example, someone like John Mcaffee. So revenue officer is tasked with attempting to contact the taxpayer and secure the return. Failing that, it may go to exam for a substitute filing. There's just not as many revenue officers. If it's a non filing 1099/w2 recipient, the computer takes care of a lot of it without requiring special attention from a revenue officer or examiner. While this is a logical way to allocate funds and leverage technology and automation, it results in disparate treatment.

In all reality, I don't know much about Mcaffee. Maybe he's more of a Wesley Snipes kind of guy. Maybe IRS criminal investigations would be bringing the hammer instead. Not sure how their budget/effectiveness has shifted so this whole discussion may not be directly related to Mcaffee.

But there are problems. The poor are easier to audit/collect from. The rich take more resources. Resources that there just aren't quite enough of.",news

Sure, they know right from wrong for the most part and some even want to commit and enjoy committing those actions, but the same can be said for sex.

"If that were true, then the article would be meaningless. The whole point of the article is the guy was acquitted on the charges under which the assets were seized - the drug charges. 

They court couldn’t prove the money was acquired due to illegal drug related activities. They then put the burden of proof on him to petition for the money’s return. Which he did and they denied. 

His petition was flimsy and, I agree with you, probably bullshit. But it’s the “probably” part when seizing someone’s assets under unsubstantiated circumstances that is the problem. 

If police come into my house and seizes $15k in casino earnings because there is drug activity there. Then, acquits me of those drugs charges but keeps the money because they don’t believe the casino story, then I’ve been wronged by the system. 

This should not be allowed in principle. Let’s say I did not win that money at a casino. That I had been selling drugs but just happened to not have any amount on me during the bust at the party. 

Both of the scenarios are equally plausible during this situation. The fact that I would have to petition to return those funds and the courts could say “it’s probable but unprovable that the money was acquired illegally as opposed to through a casino” puts the burden of proof on me.

"Every ""plan year"" (which may be different from a calendar year depending on your employer's fiscal calendar, mine runs from Sept.-Aug., for example), you have to pay the deductible before your insurance company will pay for anything (with certain exceptions, such as most plans pay 100% for preventative care visits, such as physicals).

And even better, most of the time, once you hit your deductible, you still have to pay more, since there's an even *higher* number called the ""out of pocket maximum."" In my case, I have a $3000 deductible, and a $6000 OOPM, so even after I've paid $3000, I still have to pay between 20-80% of costs depending on service until I hit that number, and only then will it work like insurance used to, where I pay the insurance company a premium and then they pay for my care.

So, to use me as an example, my wife is pregnant, due in September. I just had a sleep study done, which caused me to hit the deductible and get most of the way to the OOPM, and I'll more than likely need another one to set up a CPAP, which will get us the rest of the way there. But since the plan year resets *before* my wife is due, we get to pay the full deductible and OOPM *twice* this year! (Average cost of complication-free childbirth in the US is between $12-16k). Lucky us. But of course, public insurance is ""too expensive"" to implement, so we get to pay $12,000 out of pocket this calendar year, plus our premium costs!

"Read in [context](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/410/179.html) of the decision, a health of the mother requirement places the professional judgment of the individual physician regarding the necessity of the abortion essentially beyond judicial question.  I could be wrong, as my knowledge is not comprehensive and I do not have access to a proper legal search engine, but I would be very surprised if any case exists that applies the health factors from *Doe*  in a manner that invalidates a physician's judgment.  Are you aware of any such precedent?

Read in the context of the NY law, interpreting it as a blanket permit to conduct late term abortions is not unreasonable.

The law expands abortion providers to include any [Title VIII](http://www.op.nysed.gov/title8/) ""health care practitioner,"" meaning the judgment call will not be restricted to medical doctors.  Neither the bill itself nor Title VIII actually define ""health care practitioner,"" oddly.  In their [public health law](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PBH/18) it is defined as physicians, physicians' assistants, chiropractors, dentists, dental hygienists, certified dental assistants, physical therapists, nurses, podiatrists, optometrists, ophthalmic dispensers, psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists, and language pathologists, but who knows if that's what they meant in this bill.  It's safe bet they didn't intend to restrict it to physicians, or they would have mentioned the profession by name.

Further, the law contains zero penalties for performing a late term abortion not clearly falling into the three reasons.  The worst a ""practitioner"" could expect to face would be a malpractice lawsuit.  It even removes the line authorizing investigating a ""death resulting from a criminal abortion,"" because under it ""criminal abortion"" no longer exists.

I don't see much to support your assessment that these categories or this law require some showing of necessity to justify an abortion.

Of course as it is a new law, how it actually plays out remains to be seen.  Given that NY already has the highest rate and number of abortions of any state that reports the information to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/ss/ss6713a1.htm) I don't expect good things.

"Any stat using ""gun death"" includes suicide. The reason they do it is to confuse you, no other stats are kept this way. And if you read the link I posted, all gun violence and murder has not risen, it has fallen dramatically over time. Accidental death by gun has also fallen dramatically over time. The only thing increasing is suicide. Australia substituted suicide by hanging for guns and their ban made no difference in their long term trends. Is a hanging suicide somehow a better outcome?

Suicide is increasing, therefore ""gun deaths"" are increasing. Murder and accidental death are on a long-term downward trend. Gun ownership is almost as low as its ever been and there are more restrictions and barriers in place now than ever before. Why is this a problem now? Guns are less available today than ever before, why were there so few school shootings in decades past? Why are gun control measures focused on things that wouldn't have prevented these shootings - its almost like they are an excuse to push old bills forward...

You need to decide what problem you are trying to fix. Is it murder ([we are not close to the highest](https://medium.com/handwaving-freakoutery/everybodys-lying-about-the-link-between-gun-ownership-and-homicide-1108ed400be5)) is it suicide (we are not close to the highest), is it accidental death (still not close), or is the problem in your eyes guns?

Also abortion is not one I can make black or white. I don't usually like explaining my stance because it's usually enough to get both sides in a sander. But when we have the fertilized egg, there's a point you can manipulate the cells to get identical twins. Because I can change Sam into Sam and Pat I can pretty clearly say that whatever makes us individuals isn't there yet. Therefore i'm totally okay with destroying it at that stage. However... past a point that I do to the fetus affects the future baby. If (hypothetically) the mother demanded doctors amputate a limb of the fetus, I couldn't support that. It's not her body that she's affecting at that point. Abortion falls into the same category because it's destroying the fetus just like I couldn't support a woman hypothetically destroying the fetus's arm. If we're talking about a miscarriage drug or other things that affect the uterus... those are more ambiguous because at least those are her changing her body.

If someone is robbing you at gunpoint and sees you with a gun, you’re more likely to either get shot or have your weapon taken by this guy. Concealing it makes both of those situations less likely and in the (very extreme btw) circumstance where you’d have to pull your gun and shoot someone, you not want them to know it’s coming",news
"&gt; You can't survive off being vegan if you do t supplement

This is blatantly untrue. While supplements help, they are not necessary. I know this because I have been vegan for over 3 years and rarely supplement, and am overall in much better health than before. 

&gt;and many people have health issues being vegan.

A vegan diet is supported by some of the world's top health organizations as nutrionally complete and healthy. I would he happy to link sources if you want. People who get sick on a vegan diet are eating a poorly implemented and improper diet. 

&gt; What do you think will happen to an animal if they aren't hunted?... No, they will be eaten alive by a predator or freeze or starve to death.

Or die of old age. You act like 100% of animals will die horrible grousome deaths, and that is disingenous. Sure, there is the possiblility that they die horribly, but they also could die peacfully, and killing them when you have access to alternatives is needlessly robbing them of their life. 

&gt;just because you grew up sheltered and can't ha she the death of a wild animal, doesn't mean everyone grew up as sheltered as you did

I did not grow up sheltered, and even helped on my grandpa's farm. Believe it or not, I chose this path for a reason. I chose to inform myself and question my actions. You don't go from eating meat 3 times a day to vegan for shits and giggles. Please stop with the assumptions. 

&gt; Hunters also will hunt a mature animal that has lived a long life so they aren't taking anything away from them

Um, what? If they are killing them before they die, then they are indeed taking away their life.

&gt; I don't think you fully understand how unforgiving nature is or the mindset of someone wanting to hunt their own meat and eat a meal that they provided to their family completely and know exactly where that meat came from.

If they do not have access to these alternatives, and eating meat is the only way for survival, then of course that is acceptable. What is not acceptable is the people who shop at Walmart/etc., who have access to these alternatives, pretending they had no other choice than to needlessly kill. ",news

"Cant deny those things happening, but through the course of europe settling in what is now America, there was a ton of fighting between settlers and natives. And of course the Europeans had the advantage and won. 2 major advantages really. Well 1 much smaller than the other. The smaller of the two is that they had guns o plenty while the natives didnt always have guns (it depends on what point of history were at. Obviously the longer Europeans are around, the higher the chance the natives had guns). And the biggest reason Europeans steamed rollled all over the natives was because ~90% of the natives across all of America had been killed by diseases and that requires a long time of recovery. People dont realize that this is a part of world history that is unavoidable. There is no way humans discover bacteria, how they cause diseases, and develop medicine to cure it, before the discover and migrate a whole half of their own planet.

As for slavery. Again, these things happened, cant deny that. But also all of the world had slaves. And who enslaved the most people? Well the africans of course. Tribes would enslave other tribes and then sell them to europeans. Thats why so many slaves were african. Every race in the world has had at least one moment in history where they were enslaved. But the African and middle east were the best at it by far. In the end though, they did end up helping the US economy grow a ton after independence. Then machines were made that eliminated the need for slaves. And then they tried to keep them anyway and say they need them. They didnt need them. And even when they were freed and the civil war was fought and won, the ""wages"" they were paid were still like they were slaves.

"https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2006/jan/15/michigans-dirty-little-secret-sexual-abuse-of-female-prisoners-pervasive-ongoing/

When there was an epidemic of female prisoners getting raped by guards, John Engler did everything he could to ruin the investigation:

&gt;When the U.S. Justice Department launched an investigation in 1994, for example, Governor John Engler, who left office in 2003, responded by banning investigators from the state's female prisons. In June 1998, the United Nations also planned to visit the prisons in connection with a report on U.S. women's prisons in general. The day before the scheduled visit, however, Engler refused investigators access to the prisons, calling the U.N. an unwitting tool in the Justice Department's agenda to discredit the State of Michigan.

&gt;But Michigan lawmakers have taken other steps to quell prisoner complaints as well. In 1999, they revamped Michigan's Civil Rights Act (CRA) to specifically exclude prisoners after March 2000. The same year, legislators imposed a physical injury requirement for sex assault victims to obtain damages. Now, guards can grope or rape prisoners to their heart's content, so long as their careful not to injure them.

&gt;The latest move came in 2003 when the legislature voted to kill the Corrections Ombudsman Office, which investigated claims of sexual assaults and other prisoner complaints. Created in 1975 as an independent fact finder, the office had been steadily weakened since its inception. Lawmakers had already cut the agency's staff and restricted its investigative powers, allowing it to open investigations only at the request of a legislator.

Despite the conditions there, which were like a third world country:

&gt;""In 1998, three women accused Rockey of repeatedly groping them and forcing them to perform oral sex. After a State Police Investigation corroborated a portion of the women's stories, Rockey was charged with five counts of misdemeanor criminal sexual contact. Though he lost his job, Rockey never stood trial. A judge threw the case out in April 2000 after prosecutors failed to timely submit their witness list.""

&gt;Often, the MDOC skirts protocol when investigating complaints of sexual abuse by employees--especially high-ranking ones. Willis Chapman, Assistant Deputy Warden at the Robert Scott prison is one example. He was accused of having sex with a prisoner in 2002. Yet, without even interviewing Chapman, and despite overwhelming evidence, investigators concluded the case was unfounded. Tammy LaCross, the accuser, was punished for lying.

&gt;In 1994, prisoner Sally Jackson accused Everett of sexually harassing her. Investigators closed that case as unfounded. On July 16, 2004, State Police questioned Everett after Curtis turned over the letters he had written her. Two days later, Everett, 53, walked out in his front yard and shot himself in the head. 

&gt;In 2000, Harris was raped and impregnated by guard Edward Hook at Camp Brighton, a 440-bed boot camp in Pinckney. She initially denied the attack because she feared Hook would harm her family. Harris later revealed she had been threatened by Hook and a female corporal. Three years before he raped Harris, prison officials received an anonymous letter calling him a ""sexual predator."" Four months later, 18 women complained that Hook groped them during pat downs or ogled them in the shower. The response was laughable. On May 25, 1999--the day the Justice Department's suit was settled--prison officials admonished Hook in a memo to exercise better judgment."" Eight months later, Hook forced prisoner Tiffany Gilmore to touch his penis. The following month, he raped Harris. In 2003, Hook pled guilty to two counts of misdemeanor sexual assault. He was sentenced to 1 year in jail. Harris, who has since been released, said she tried several times to abort the fetus.

&gt;Guard Thomas Portman, who began working at the Robert Scott prison in 1989, is a prime example. When his wife divorced him in October 1996, she noted in divorce papers that she had been forced to get a restraining order after Portman threw their 18-year-old daughter down the stairs. Portman was subsequently jailed for domestic violence. When the police notified prison officials they had a guard in jail, Warden Joan Yukins recommended a 30-day suspension. According to prison records, however, the sentence was reduced to 10 days on February 2, 1997. By then Portman was already accused of assaulting two female prisoners, Tracy Neal and Stacy Barker. Guard Orlinda Mallet-Godwin, who uncovered the abuse, said he threatened to accuse her of selling drugs if she reported him. Portman was fired but acquitted on charges of third-degree criminal sexual conduct.

&gt;In a letter to her parents, the 32-year-old prisoner said she was being sexually harassed and begged for help. I'm not doing good,"" Smith plaintively wrote in the September 16, 2002, letter. I am experiencing some sexual harassment from staff. I need you to please send me the internal affairs address. Would you please do this for me? Unfamiliar with the prison bureaucracy, Smith's parents were unable to help her. Five months later, on February 13, 2003, Smith was found dead in her cell. She had hanged herself with a sheet.

It goes on and on:

&gt;Willis Chapman was accused of having sex with a prisoner in 2002. Yet, without even interviewing Chapman, and despite overwhelming evidence, investigators concluded the case was unfounded. Tammy LaCross, the accuser, was punished for lying.

&gt;In September 2001, a different inmate named Velvet Farley Johnson, 20, told 5 guards she had been having sex with Willis Chapman, then 45. None of the guards, however, reported Johnson's admission--a violation of both state law and MDOC policy.

&gt;After Van Norman's allegation, guards Bradford Laird and Paul Raymond, who worked in the prison's control center, began monitoring Chapman's interaction with the prisoners. Later, the pair informed Assistant Deputy Warden Patricia Rodgers that they suspected Chapman was having sex with prisoners. Rodgers then notified Richard Stock, another assistant warden, and Warden Clarice Stovall.

&gt;At this point--according to MDOC policy--the probe should have been handed over to Internal Affairs because allegations of intercourse were involved. Prison officials should have also limited Chapman's access to prisoners. Neither action was taken. Instead, Chapman continued to work with the women he was accused of raping--as well as potential witnesses--and MDOC regional director Steven Wendry was called in to run the investigation.
At first, Wendry interviewed only LaCross and two other prisoners. All three denied anything happened, and Wendry closed the investigation two days later. On July 10, 2002, Warden Stovall rejected Wendry's initial report and ordered him to interview the other witnesses. Wendry then interviewed guard Laird--but not Raymond or Ms. Van Norman--and a week later again closed the investigation as unfounded."" This time his report was accepted. Van Norman was punished for making a false statement and confined to her cell for 7 days, and Chapman was allowed to continue prowling the prison.

&gt;Chapman was subsequently fired for violating 5 MDOC rules--including sexual misconduct--but not criminally charged. In fact, he didn't even stay fired. Ten months after his August 28, 2003, firing, arbitration hearing officer Benjamin Wolkinson determined LaCross and Johnson weren't credible, and ignoring all of the other witnesses and evidence, ordered Chapman reinstated with back pay.

Because they also pay for you.

“BuT tHeY dOnT pAy InCoMe tAx!”

But they pay sales tax. They pay a big ol tax on liquor, especially, in the case of our alcoholic. They may buy drugs or things on a black market, but everyone buys THINGS and there is tax on almost every THING. So they are contributing according to their means, to your, my, their, our, overall support system.

“ThEy DoNt DeSeRvE iT!”

Says you. You think they don’t deserve it because of xyz reason, but freedom means your opinion on their worthiness doesn’t matter and doesn’t enter into it.

Again, freedom has a price, and that price isn’t a restriction on your ability to do whatever you want, so much as it restricts people from doing whatever they want TO YOU.

I had a friend. Horrible addict. We lamented they could not be held in treatment against their will, for their own good.

Except, I realized, that that was a good thing, overall. To be clear, it was absolutely hateful, real suffering we went through and it would have been so much easier to deal with/forget about the issue by forcible confinement. But they were of age, and medically competent, so we could do nothing.

And that is a GOOD THING. Bad for our little group, personally, GOOD for our little group as a whole.

It means that we also, as not drug addicts, could not be forcibly confined or have our freedom taken away or restricted by an outside group (minus of course criminal activity). 

“BuT iM a GOOD pErSoN!”

Maybe you are. Right now. To the people who would otherwise make the judgement call. 

But what if there is a change in power? What if suddenly having a history of voting for xyz was enough to make people in power believe you needed to be restrained for your own good, or the good of others?

What if someone decides that you are following the wrong god? Or a god? Or no god?

What if someone decides that anyone who doesn’t have a flag outside their home needs to be restrained.

What if they decide children who bring allergens into common classrooms need to be forcibly restrained. What if their parents need to be forcibly restrained.

What if that glass of wine is no longer acceptable, and people are concerned because you are using this drug to”feel good”, “unwind” “relax”.

What if being hetero/homo/bi sexual means, to society, that you must be forcibly incarcerated, treated.

What if having no children means that. What if having more than one hold meant that?

You get the picture.

The problem is a lack of empathy stemming from a lack of critical thinking skills, and a smattering of low self esteem.

There but for the grace of god go I, they recite, but do not believe. 

Because they have to believe that there is something fundamentally OTHER between them and the homeless person, or the torturous hard work and no reward of an immigrant, or the poor, or the sick, or disable, or obese, that makes them IMMUNE to such things. 

There isn’t. Not everyone is ready to confront and accept that. 

No one thinks it could be them, in that situation, or in a similar situation with the same premise.

No one thinks about whether if it was them, that some outside force finds could benefit by removing them. Everyone honks they vote for the right person, pray to the right god, have the right colour skin, have “good genes”.

They can’t see that. They see themselves as OTHER. The problem they want to be rid of is NOT, fundamentally, the same as them, because, what about, yeah but-

No.

We are all the same.

Junkie gets good healthcare, you get good healthcare. Same.

Junky can’t be forcibly imprisoned by their family, YOU can’t be by your family. Same.

Junky is free to fuck up or improve their life, you are free to as well. Same.

Mueller is using significant crimes to pressure Trump's followers into giving up evidence. However he hasn't charged any of them with Conspiracy to defraud the United States or similar crimes. Yet.

This could be because he isn't able to, either because they did nothing wrong that they can be charged with, or because there isn't sufficient evidence to make the case, so he's instead using their attempt to prevent the discovery of the truth against them.

Or he's doing it on purpose. While charging any of these guys with direct conspiracy regarding Russia and Trump would be incredibly vindicating, it would also provoke a much stronger reaction from Trump who presently is able to interpret their indictments as being separate from himself, and thus not as much of a liability.

There's a legendary post about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24vzgl/you_just_won_a_656_million_dollar_lottery_what_do/chba4bf/). It explains everything in detail.

It boils down to: make all the decisions before you even go and collect the money. Put it in trust funds. Put it in T Bills. Pre pay health insurance for the rest of your life. Prepay college for your family. Set up trust funds that take care of expenses. Put the money there and walk away. Let the trust fund do the work.

And when you actually collect the money, conceal your identity as long as you possibly can. Making yourself visible BEFORE collecting the money or before having a team is a remarkably dumb move.",news

So if you buy a larger house in an expensive area the property taxes, maintenance, and utilities for owning that house will add up over time and eventually you'd run out of lottery money and would have to sell it and you'd be back where you started. Your normal job as a truck driver income doesn't really cover half of those monthly costs, so you're basically stuck hemorrhaging money until it runs out

Mushrooms are consistently recognized as the safest recreational drug.  There is no reason to keep this substance illegal.  There have to be less barriers to researching it.  Psilocybin and other psychedelics may be the key to treating mental illness.  There is so much we can learn from them.

https://www.kff.org/uninsured/fact-sheet/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/

The drop in uninsured individuals was entirely thanks to the ACA, and the changes it implemented. Insurance doesn't matter anyways when there's so many stipulations to you receiving care. You could end up dying on route to a hospital 2 counties over cause it's the nearest in network hospital, or you forgot about a cold sore from when you were 8 years old, so you have to pay out of pocket anyways.  (insurance companies employ people to find a reason to deny your claim/coverage, many times even retroactively years after you've gotten care )



Social spending does not equate a healthy social welfare/disability system. The us also spends more in taxes on health coverage than any developed nation, but get exactly none. Look outside the borders of the us dood. Citation is not needed to see this at all. Simply talk to people receiving assistance.

I believe the law in question is GINA -- https://www.genome.gov/27568492/the-genetic-information-nondiscrimination-act-of-2008/

"The more expensive ones act faster. So while R may kick in say 30-45 min after dosing, Humalog will act as fast as 15 min. Also N and R are generally used in conjunction with eachother so that's two insulins needed. Where pump users only need one, the Humalog or novalog.

"It wasn't really the party so much as Maduro. His predecessor, Chavez, was *very* popular, and he was the one who really leaned the country into socialism. Maduro (Chavez's VP) was a questionable leader from the start. He initially succeeded Chavez because Chavez died in office, and then Maduro won a very questionable election (50.8%). There were pretty easy to believe claims that Maduro used his power as acting president to rig the election just enough to put him over the edge. And that has since been made more credible by the fact that he basically dissolved the branches of government that became democratically controlled by the opposition party.

"First, the bill would have curbed future sales, not confiscate weapons that are already out there.  Your firearms would be grandfathered in.  Also most republicans support some additional gun controls like expanded background checks.

Second, The government has already banned whole categories of firearms from civilian use (and the supreme court backed it).  You, as a civilian, already cannot buy automatic weapons, weapons the fire above a specific calibur, or armor penetrating rounds, and much more without a class 3 license and in some cases a FFL.  Both of those licenses require extensive background checks, course work, and requires you to register those specific weapons with a state or federal agency.    

As a life long hunter and gun owner who worked in a family owned Bait &amp; Hunt/Gun Shop for 6 years, there are some weapons civilians have no need for.  I am not some ""lib"" trying to ban ""scary"" looking guns.  I am for requiring a class 3 licenses to buy certain weapons or high capacity mags.  You as a civilian have no use for a drum mag or a .50cal anything.  No self respecting hunter is shooting deer with an AR.  Even feral hogs and bears.  5.56, 7.62, and other mil rounds are meant for war not hunting or home defense.

Third, while I don't agree with every piece of gun control legislation that gets introduced, i am for discussing it seriously.  

Here are 6 reasonable actions we could implament now that would have an impact.

1) federal-izing gun laws so that criminals can't go to states like Indiana and Wisconsin, with lax laws, stock up and sell them in to states and cities that would other wise ban or curb the sales of those weapons like chicago (most firearms confiscated in chicago come from out of state). 
2) mandating gun safes and external safety devices like trigger locks.  Most firearm deaths are accidents, things that reduce that, especially for kids is a win for all.
3) banning conversion kits or external accessories that allow for a semi auto weapon to achieve full auto or imitate it.
4) background checks on ALL sales and transfers.  There should be no loopholes for background checks even for personal sales.  
5) mandatory firearms training.  You are required to take some form of drivers ed to get a drivers license, its reasonable to want someone buying a tool of death (guns are designed to kill things, that is just a fact) should know how to use it and store it properly.
6) remove laws that block agencies like the CDC from studying the effects of guns and gun violence.  Its hard to make informed decisions if you don't have data.  Groups like the NRA and weapon manufacturers have bribed (donated to) politicians to ensure that laws have been passed so government won't fund research.  

While I'm sure someone will find some super super specific situation where one of these will be an issue, for the most part these will work for 95%+.

"&gt; Modern mass-society cannot exist without current models of industrial production. 

America's dominance of the modern mass production society wouldn't have occurred if not for its protection of free thought, expression, and a tolerance and even support for ideas that challenged orthodoxy. 

The idea that the state played a role in providing the bare necessities for people to be able to participate in public, political, and economic life and not to simply maintain the established order of things (which is how most monarchical and aristocratic societies had been structured before) was a huge shift and arguably paved the way for America's progress.

I am not saying that hierarchy doesn't exist in America or western democracies but there is a unique philosophical understanding that investing in ways that maximize people's opportunities for prosperity that goes beyond mass production of goods in itself generates prosperity through innovation. 

What you're talking about is maximizing the utility of human beings to the benefit of the economy. 

The idea of America was that having a government for the people, of the people, and by the people that could chart it's own course to the benefit of all would lead to prosperity and they were right. So much so that the world began to copy their model of social, political, and economic organization and the United States became a dominant world power.

"No let's be clear.

You are inventing racism in order to act like a victim and in turn trying to cheapen what racism means. Your own comments demonstrably prove you have no fucking idea how society functions back when you started crying about how you never owned slaves as if that fucking matters.

Life isnt fair. The fact that nobody cares if some white people are cast as villians isn't racism, its reality. 

Sorry, but the fact that this commerical was produced by white producers and white and executives and white owned Ad agency staffed by white people for a major company owned by a white board of directors matters in a nation whose government is almost entirely white and whose wealth is entirely owned by white people where every single black man in their 40s was raised by parents who spent most of their lives as legally subhuman matters.

No one gives a fuck that white people are cast as the villian because it's a choice made by white people, it's not a label forced on us by other fucking people like it was for everyone else... usually by white people. That is the context by the way for why this would look wierd if reversed. That is why you cant just flip it around.

If you spend three centuries punching someone and then go on to joke about the effects of you punching them, you are an asshole. If people joke about you getting punched, it's just not the same.

And then look at the commerical, nothing in it has anything to do with race. It's literally just the actors skin color. The bad guys arent bad because  they are white, they just are white and happen to bad. Oh no.

That is the best part. There is literally no racism, nothing implies their skin color fucking matters. No hard digs at ""white culture"" or attempts to judge all white people. Just actors who are white.

So there is no societal racism at play, it's a commerical made by white dudes and not some oppressive group forcing its outside labeling on white people... because literally no group has that power. And most importantly there is no textual racism. 

So either you are asserting that the just the idea that white people can be bad guys is racist. Or you are trying to cheapen the entire concept of societal racism and the impact it has on people by arguing that wealthy white people casting some actors as white is what societal racism is.

You are basically trying to argue that you are just as injured by some white actors being the bad guy in a commerical produced by white people in a nation run almost entirely by white people as those whose entire place in culture was controlled by hostile others for centuries.

"Honey...I'm not angry with you. You're too predictably disappointing to be angry with. I just think you're an extremely ignorant, selfish, basic white boy, and unintelligent because you don't CARE that you're ignorant. 

&gt; I get more money from tax cuts since my check is larger than the average poor person. 

I get the logic, I understand why you think that. However, I'm telling you that if you do the research, you will find that tax cuts have never helped people in the same tax bracket as you. TAX CUTS DO NOT HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS. I get that you THINK they do, but they do not. They ONLY benefit the wealthy in the end. 

**Edit**: I want to explain this part more because I know you won't research it... 

When tax cuts are done, they're done across the board. The result is that the lower and middle class get a TEMPORARY boost, but the top 10%-1% are gaining even MORE wealth than they already have. This doesn't SOUND bad, they earned that money right? But the reality is that these people are already cheating on their taxes by hiding money in offshore accounts. ALL wealthy people do it, you are naive if you think otherwise. 

That is all money that ISN'T funding government programs and urban infrastructures (roads, bridges, etc.). You THINK it isn't hurting you, but people suddenly become homeless all the fucking time, a lot of times it genuinely is out of their control. People don't WANT to be homeless, obviously. If you ever lost your job and needed assistance, you'd want a good welfare system that actually had money in it, etc. And even if that never happens to you, you don't want homeless people because homeless people create more crime, you want good roads, you want good public schools, etc. 

Cutting the already low taxes on extremely wealthy people, and everyone overall, has given the middle class a temporary boost for short periods of time, but it has created a HUGE wealth gap overtime. Our economy, infrastructure, and overall happiness as a nation is broken because we keep cutting fucking taxes, overall, and especially for rich people. PUT YOURSELF IN OTHER PEOPLE'S SHOES AND THINK ABOUT YOUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN INSTEAD OF JUST YOURSELF. SOCIAL PROGRAMS NEED FUNDING FOR SOCIETY TO THRIVE AS A WHOLE. VOTING FOR ANYONE SAYING THEY WANT TO CUT TAXES IS YOU SELFISHLY THINKING IN THE SHORT-TERM. THE MIDDLE CLASS IS DISAPPEARING. YOUR VOTE HAS LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES. But oh fucking well, I guess. **End of Edit**

Also, do some fucking research on the wealth gap and how it widens every year instead of trying to make a joke about how Republicans just want to make everyone rich. It's not a good and fun thing when the top 1% of households own more wealth than the bottom 90% COMBINED. The poor and middle class (YOU and YOUR people) have almost no buying power in this country, despite making up most of the population, and you voted for a president who wants to further that agenda. 

You took whatever nonsense Trump diarrhea'd out of his mouth about making our middle class stronger and ate that shit up. He is a documented liar and conman and you, and millions of others, fucking believed him. To look at Trump's past and think he cares about literally anyone but himself and his own wealth is extremely delusional, at best. This is a man with multiple accusations of sexual assault and multiple examples of him not giving even a minimum amount of respect to most people. He can't even keep the fucking white house staffed because he is THAT awful to work for/with. He doesn't care about ANYONE and their wants and needs, least of all you. You keep burying your face in his ass and eating his shit up, though. Enjoy!

&gt; Well you can’t change your birth sex, gender sure, but not sex. Unless you’re suggesting trump suggested removing gender on forms, which I don’t think is possible. 

Yeah, you obviously don't give a fuck about anyone but yourself, so of course you don't know what I'm talking about. Transgender people can currently change their gender legally so that, for example, a mtf trans woman would be able to change the sex marker on her driver license from an M to an F. Trump suggests making it so that sex markers are unchangeable. Whatever you're born with, you're legally stuck with. This essentially erases trans people entirely. He's already banned trans people from the military. 

I'm not trans myself, but since I actually give a fuck about others, I can put myself in their shoes and think, ""Yeah, it would be the worst to have my identity erased by my own fucking government,"" so I avoid voting for any political party that runs on a platform of wanting to remove rights from others, you know, like a decent fucking human.

&gt; But considering I’m a man and I don’t practice unsafe sex and so I am not at risk of having an accidental child, it’s not my priority.  

Legal abortion is heavily credited for our dramatic drop in crime rates. Outlawing abortion affects society, period. Also, again, you only give a fuck about yourself. What if it was your girlfriend, mom, sister, cousin, etc. being forced to give birth? Would you care then? I also want to point out that there is no 100% foolproof birth control in existence, so you and a partner might have the need for an abortion one day, despite practicing safe sex.

&gt; I am very skeptical of the government’s ability to just start taking rights of a group and so I don’t worry about it.

As I just mentioned, THEY ARE ALREADY BEING TAKEN AWAY, MY DUDE. The fact that there's no laws in place to protect already established rights at a state level is also a form of taking away rights (It's legal for states to say that trans people can't use the public restroom they identify with, it's legal for states to refuse service, housing, jobs, etc. to gay people, it's legal for states to impose bullshit loophole laws that result in abortion clinics getting shut down, making abortions extremely difficult and, often, impossible to get for lots of women who don't have the time and money to travel). We've established that you don't care about anyone else but yourself, so of course you didn't notice, but it's already a thing. YOU will always have rights as a cis, straight (I assume), white man in America, others aren't so lucky.

Let's also remember that no one thought Hitler would murder literally millions of innocent human beings when he first came into power. By the time they realized he shouldn't be in power, it was too late. I'm not saying that Trump is the next Hitler, just that everything is a slippery slope. Your entire logic on this is, ""I know they SAY they want to take away rights, but they won't ACTUALLY do it,"" which isn't logical at all, especially since IT IS ALREADY HAPPENING AS I TYPE.

&gt; Dude... your just giving me ammo to say your an angsty teen/young adult who hates his parents. Think before you type man. 

Dude...I'm actually a 27-year-old woman. I live in the reddest red state you can think of, born and raised Republican. As soon as I was old enough to understand the information and form my own opinions, I decided that I don't support political parties based on platforms of hate and control. 

I mentioned my parents because, just like you, they vote with feels and not because they've actually put in the effort to make sure that Republican policies and agendas line up with their wants and needs. You FEEL that Trump has your best interest at heart as a middle class person, but he's entirely full of shit, and you, just like my parents, fell for it. Now we're all paying. 

I've noticed that people who vote Republican are ALWAYS ""Fuck you, got mine."" None of you genuinely care about others and their rights, the same basic rights that you have and take for granted as a cis, white, straight (I assume), male. The absurdity of it is that you don't want equality to the extent that you vote against your own best interests. You would all rather have no policies that benefit you personally as long as you can fuck others over. Like you can keep telling me over and over that Republican policies work for you as a middle class person, but it is FACT that you're wrong. So it's at a point where I have to assume that you are either A) a complete moron who can't read, retain information, and think critically for yourself, B) an insecure, selfish asshole, who will go without having your needs met as long as it means less equality and a feeling of superiority, OR C) a combination of both.

Also, *you're just giving... and *you're an angsty..., not your.

You can call me childish or whatever, but it doesn't change the fact that you are selfish and ignorant. You just keep doing you, basic white boy, because you're right, YOU will never have your rights taken away for voting in a Republican...at the expense of everyone who isn't white, cis, and straight. What a massive donkey you are.

With all that being said, I won't reply to your stupidity after this. I've already spent way more time explaining to you that you're a selfish moron than I really wanted to.

"[The DoD keeps a 7000 word list of about 400 different conditions](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/disqualifiers-medical-conditions.html) that can be automatic disqualifiers for military service.  This list includes mundane/everyday things like: headaches, poor hearing, poor eyesight, being underweight, ADHD, IBS, severe allergies/hayfever, motion sickness, psoriasis/dermatitis, extreme acne, sleep apnea, severe depression, admission to a mental health facility, antisocial tendencies, poor academic record - plus about 400 more conditions.  Note that it would be expressly illegal for a private company to decline to hire an individual for nearly all of the above reasons.

Depends.  A lot of CUs are trying to find a way to act like banks without having to be actual banks.  Most recently my CU decided they needed to change their name to show that they are more inclusive to people than just military along with dropping their status as a federal CU to a state CU.  They then culminated their horsefuckery by sending all checking customers a letter stating that they were revamping their checking accounts and doing away with the old structure.

"&gt; That's your interpretation. My impression is that the overwhelming majority of people consider rape to be among the most reprehensible crimes and people who have been proven to have committed it to be reprehensible people. 

Again. I know enough women (and men, but mostly women) who have been victims of sexual assault that I cannot count them on both hands. Not a single one had their assailant face any sort of consequences, legal or social. 

If you ask a person on the street if they think rape is wrong, they'll say of course they do. But it is very different when it is *their* brother or *their* best friend or *their* pastor being accused. Then they rally around them. 

Are you honestly saying that if you found out that your brother or good friend was being accused of rape you'd side with the accuser? No, you'd probably side with your friend or family member, right? Most people do. 

&gt;Considering what you're arguing, you're probably the type of person who thinks that not just immediately assuming every rape accusation is true is somehow equivalent to ""not giving a shit"".

No, they literally suffered no consequences whatsoever other than maybe losing a few mutual friends. Personal and professional lives progressed unhindered. 

I seriously suggest you start asking people in your life, because I would bet money you know several sexual assault survivors who haven't told you what happened. And I would bet further money that not one of them ever saw any justice.

"&gt; I've seen your other comments, dont act like you're right here when you clearly arent.

I've confined my comments to the law regarding deadly force against fleeing suspects. One way I try to not be wrong is to avoid commenting on the parts I don't know exactly what I'm talking about. You should try it.

&gt; The kid was old enough to understand the consequences of his actions. 

True but irrelevant: the law applies equally to adults, and for my purposes I was assuming the fleeing suspect was a full-grown adult of sound mind and normal intelligence.

&gt; He had already committed crimes and was going to be arrested no matter what.

True but irrelevant: the fleeing suspect is _assumed_ to be guilty of crimes; the question is when that makes it OK to shoot them dead while fleeing.

&gt; He then made his situation worse by ignoring orders and attempting to flee...

True but irrelevant: a fleeing suspect is assumed to be (you'll never guess!) _fleeing._ You can't flee without ignoring orders to halt; otherwise officers would never have to contemplate shooting you. They'd order you to halt and then just handcuff you.

&gt; WHILE CARRYING A PERCIEVED FIREARM

True, but not as relevant as you think: I've been assuming the firearm is not only perceived to be real, but actually real. The firearm _IS_ a factor in deciding whether the person poses a threat of death or grievous bodily harm, so it's relevant. But you all-capsed it because you'd like to think that by itself it furnishes probable cause to assume he's about to kill somebody, and that's simply not true.

The thing you don't get is that probable cause means ""reasonable grounds."" Cops need reasonable grounds for what? For believing that the person is imminently going to grievously harm or kill somebody. Not for believing that he might, or could, but for believing that he will. It might shock you to learn that a lot of effort goes into teaching cops what this does and doesn't mean.

By your reasoning, I could say that a speeder is liable to kill someone, but if I shot him dead, the argument _would not_ hold up in court. Yes, I can easily imagine circumstances where his reckless driving gets someone killed, but that's not good enough.

If he were speeding _toward me,_ and _down a narrow alley,_ I absolutely could shoot him dead. Now I have more than sufficient probable cause to believe that he's about to kill someone. Or if he's speeding _away_ from me (fleeing, if you will), but _toward a Thanksgiving parade,_ I could again shoot him dead.

But _by itself,_ the fast-moving car isn't enough for probable cause. I specifically mentioned ""means, motive, and opportunity,"" not because that's really how probable cause works, but because that's a pretty damn good approximation for people who aren't trained in this. The car is the means -- but he doesn't pose a danger without an _opportunity_ to kill someone, such as a high concentration of pedestrians, or if he were driving across a field full of picnickers. And it makes a difference what he intends to do: if I believe that he's planning to run over his ex, it makes a big difference; if I believe he wants to run me over in the course of his escape, it makes a big difference; but the Supreme Court has already said that if his sole intention is to escape, then that _by itself_ isn't sufficient reason to kill him.

&gt; A fleeing armed suspect is a threat to the public and the officers life. It's not hard.

You're assuming that whatever is reasonable to you is also how the law works. Trust me, you're in for a big surprise if you ever have a brush with the law. Pro tip: hire a lawyer.

I can assure you that at no point in my training have I ever been told, ""If the fleeing suspect is armed, then of course you can always go ahead and shoot him."" The opposite: I was put through [Laser Shot](https://www.lasershot.com/) scenarios involving fleeing suspects, sometimes armed, in which I had to make a shoot / no-shoot decision. Being armed was never treated as automatic justification to shoot. In general, shooting a fleeing suspect was rarely deemed justified.

\* And yes, there's a shadow side to this training. We were inevitably taught, as a side-effect, how to come up with a story to justify almost anything. In one case I passed a scenario after shooting a fleeing suspect by claiming (a) that I thought he was armed, and (b) that he was running toward a crowded area, where I reasonably believed he would resort to violence if his flight were impeded. I was bullshitting though.

"&gt; Boys who didn’t fight back were considered pussies or wimps or weak.

It's not a positive character trait to be unable to stand up for yourself, and that occasionally includes defending yourself physically. Starting violence is something we should teach our kids to never engage in, but trying to make sure boys never get into fights at all seems like a misguided effort, and completely ignores the realities of social interaction and escalation. I'm no good at fighting but I won't back down if the situation requires the threat of escalation, which usually ends the situation before a fight breaks out.

&gt; By breaking up the fight it’s showing that violence is not the right way to handle things and that fighting doesn’t validate masculinity. 

When you say violence is not the right way to handle things do you mean in all contexts? I can certainly think of many contexts where violence is absolutely the correct response, and teaching young children that violence is absolutely off limits will make some very fucked up adults who can't stand up for themselves at all.

As for validating masculinity, I'm genuinely confused. Do you think that's why men fight? That's so naive I don't even know where to begin.

"&gt;People who protested the Iraq War were arguably working to ""undermine"" the government of the US

I think your confusing not wanting American soldiers to be sent off and killed (which is why people protested the war in Iraq, not because they wanted to support the government of Iraq) with actively helping another country, in this case Russia and it's oligarchs, to the detriment of the USA which is nothing but hurt by the lifting of these sanctions which congress put in place as a result of Russia's active measures to destabilize the US and our allies.

One is disagreeing with our governments stance and policy, which is expected and desired in a healthy democracy. The second is an attack on our republic because it not only supports the individuals working to undermine our values while also actively hurting our economy in the process by driving down our own steel/aluminum production which is already hurting from tariffs. There is no clear benefit or reason to lift these sanctions knowing that doing so only serves to aid the people these sanctions were imposed to punish.

"I don't think you're understanding the math right. The insurance companies aren't trying to ""game"" the system to fit the older model. They are simply trying to make their model as accurate as possible with the variables they are allowed to use, as that makes them the most money (they attract safer clients with fair prices and avoid more dangerous clients that they would have undercharged).

It turns out that gender is statistically correlated with accident rates. Some of this correlation can be predicted from other variables that are correlated with gender. Thus, any reasonable regression model will most likely end up charging men more, despite not knowing gender directly.

This is based on my knowledge of statistical regression/machine learning in general, so someone with specific insurance knowledge should correct me if I'm wrong. You can look up some basic regression stuff and principal component analysis if you're interested in how correlation between variables is considered in a statistical regression setting.

I'm personally okay with paying more car insurance due to my gender because the data seem to indicate that  men are genuinely more likely to get into accidents, and without knowing more details, it'd be pretty arrogant to consider myself an exception. I understand that outlawing it may prevent abuse cases and make it more consistent with other gender discrimination legislation, however.

I know that poorer people often do not have other options in regards to homeownership, but they are evidently at the mercy of their landlords.

The renter makes an initial capital investment in the property and assumes risk in doing so. To force them to hold rent stable for the sake of the people living there is limiting the potential of the property owner and disincentivizes them from investing more into the property to make it better.

The science is also not clear on the morning after pill. (And the birth control pill is basically a smaller dose of the morning after pill) Scientists can’t agree on exactly how it works but they believe it may stop a fertilized egg from implanting. Some believe a child is a child at the point of conception. When an egg is fertilized. No one actually knows and that is the problem. However, as I have mentioned numerous times before, I don’t think we will ever be able to agree to ban abortions in all cases except those medically necessary. Since abortions are performed only when a woman is deemed to be pregnant, there is no question of her pregnancy at that point.

Whereas keeping the pill at least provides the chance that a life isn’t being taken. 

If I had a magic wand and could do anything I wanted, I would create a non harmful pill (this is a magic wand) that would stop a woman from ovulating with zero fail and you only had to take it once. Then I would create another pill that would reverse all the effects of that pill and reinstate your ability to have children just as before. This would allow women to freely enjoy sex (which is extremely important) and be able to take responsibilities for their choices. They have a choice to take this pill (available for free for anyone at anytime). And the “consequences” for taking it are ensuring no unwanted pregnancies. If you choose not to take it, your consequences are known and you must take responsibility. The way it is now is backwards. Some women feel it is their “choice” to end a life as they have a “choice” over their bodies. All women should have a choice about their bodies. And they make them every day when they do or don’t have sex. Taking another life is not a choice. And it’s not taking responsibility for your actions.

"&gt;What are you talking about? Kony led the Lord’s Resistance Army, a Christian militia dedicated to reestablishing Uganda as a heterodox Christian theocracy.

Nope. He led **his** Lord's Resistance Army, a made up religion militia dedicated to Kony as the prophet who received visions and warnings of who to rape, pillage and kill.

&gt;Ideologically, the group is a [syncretic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretic) mix of [mysticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism), [Acoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoli_people)nationalism, and [Christian fundamentalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_fundamentalism), and claims to be establishing a theocratic state based on the [Ten Commandments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments) and local [Acoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoli) tradition

So it has some Christian fundamentalism in his new made up religion, but he is definitely not doing it for Christianity.

&gt;He detonated some incendiary devices too. That’s blowing stuff up.

Nope, he brought gas to burn down the place but they (people in the clinic) overpowered him.

So obviously Christianity is the motive for at least *some* of them.

No, obviously the eradication of Islam is a thing for them. Not all of them are Christians nor are all of the leadership.

I suspect if the wall ever gets built it will serve more as an a symbol than as an actual deterrent.

"&gt; If the male wants the baby, then no, she can’t drop it off no problem. 

Wrong. While a woman can be abusive, drug addicted and felon, simply by giving birth she has parental rights. Men have to fight for parental rights every step of the way.

&gt;A biological father wanting a say in adoption decisions should establish paternity as soon as possible. **Failure to establish paternity can prevent a single father from gaining any parental rights at all.** Waiting too long can demonstrate a lack of commitment to parent the child. This can even mean needing to establish paternity before the birth of the child in certain cases, such as when the mother indicates early on in pregnancy a desire to put the child up for adoption.

&gt;**Fathers who don't know of their children until after the fact can find themselves out of luck in regards to adoption decisions.** In some states, the clock on when a father should acknowledge paternity and start providing for the child begins running when the child is born (or even during pregnancy), **not when the father learns about the child.** Courts have held that fathers unaware of their child may not later object to the child's adoption, particularly when the father's lack of knowledge was his own fault.

&gt;**Beyond acknowledging paternity, unwed dads must meet a larger requirement demonstrated commitment to parenting in order to gain constitutionally protected paternal rights.** This means providing for the child's material and emotional needs, and attempting to form the fullest possible parental relationship with the child.

https://family.findlaw.com/paternity/parental-rights-unmarried-fathers-and-adoption.html

&gt;Termination is bodily autonomy issue, which men aren’t affected by due to biology.

And lets just pretend that you don't know how to read a history book and can't draw logical conclusions on why gun ownership is a right and should not be regulated lightly. (Especially because of cases like this story which are the TINIEST fraction of deaths in this country)

Geography:
 For 1 they are both islands with controlled entry points via harbors and airports. The significant difference is that the US has LARGE land borders with other disparate countries,  which means that banning items will never be AS effective as in UK/Aus since it is much easier to smuggle over a land border compared to sea or air. 

Population: The populations of the UK/Aus are largely located in small areas relative to the size of their countries. The population of the the United States is much more spread out which means it's more difficult for police to protect more rural/suburban populations (oh and they have no constitutional duty to do so, so even more reason to not rely on the police for protection.)

Culture: The UK/Aus have a significantly more homogeneous population. This means that the people of the country are inherently going to have less conflict because there are more people like them. 

I could go on, all these factors are going to make gun control policies work better in these countries. HOWEVER, these policies aren't even necessarily driving the reductions of crime that we see in western nations over the past decades. Every western country regardless of their gun control policy has seen reductions in violent crime.

"You're being paid around \~58k a year to work 80+ hour weeks. Residents make a few bucks more than a minimum wage with an MD lmao. The main training happens in residency.

Other countries doctors as a whole are not as good. There is a reason people come from all over to go to Mayo etc. Our health system sucks because of insurance companies and that's why billing is so high. If anything insurance companies own the patient and rent them out to the physician. You yet again show you have no idea about physicians despite claiming too. The Hippocratic oath isn't mandatory or anything to graduate medical school lol. It has no bearing on whether you can be a physician and isn't binding in any way. There's shit in it that's wrong.

You have no clue what you're fucking talking about but that's okay, 99% of the country doesn't understand how hospital billing works and our health system. You don't get to sit and tell people who went through 7-11 years of schooling (yes residency is still schooling with a mentor and makes up the majority of learning for physicians) whether they are pure enough to be physicians.

If you want to do that get off your ass and get a 4-year undergraduate degree with a 3.7+ gpa, score in the 90th+ percentile on the MCAT, do all the EC's required, go through 4 years of medical school, get accepted to residency programs, and then do another 3-7 years of training. Once you do all that get back to me and then maybe you can determine whether a physician is pure enough for his job.

If physicians wanted to make money they'd go into CS or business. Lawyer's job market is shit right now so yet again you show ignorance. ",news

And the answer is the broader disparity in amount and severity of racism aimed at each group. In a world where black people have been and remain in many ways subjected to more and worse racism, highlighting the few instances of unfairness toward white people seems to miss the point in a spectacular way and feels like a very poor use of resources.

"Cows already eat grass. You don't need more land.  The grain they eat is given to them at finishing lots. They are fed corn to fatten them up. So eliminating corn fed beef would actually reclaim land by eliminating the finishing lots. Cows that eat grass increase the land they can use because they repair the environment. 

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/people-and-culture/food/the-plate/2015/12/23/is-more-cattle-grazing-the-solution-to-saving-our-soil/

There is a faction of the environmentalist coalition that doesn't want beef to survive this argument because that faction is a Vegan/Vegetarian faction. They always manipulate the argument with cattle that are only fed on corn and other human grown crops. They always ignore the benefit of grass fed beef. Grass fed beef repairs the environment while growing crops destroys the environment. Grass fed beef that never goes to the finishing lots is healthier for the body because the whole purpose of corn fed beef is to increase the amount of unhealthy fat on the animal. 

There have been large herds of grass eating mammals for millions of years. They reverse desertification and naturally fertilize the soil.  As opposed to human crops that require you to obliterate the environment as the first thing you do. Then you need insecticide chemicals to kill all the insects. Then you need herbicides to kill all the non-crop plants. Then you need chemicals to fertilize the soil because growing crops turns the soil to dust as it leaches all the nutrients. these chemical treatments are not a one time deal. You have to do it constantly. These chemicals are made in plants that use coal fired electricity. These chemicals are washed into the sea and kill billions of fish. These chemicals destroy honey bee colonies which harms the rate of pollination in the environment surrounding the farm land. The environmental damage is massive.

So when someone posts an article that says meat isn't sustainable its important to know the little details they are leaving out and the parameters they set in their comparison and the motives on why they do these manipulative comparisons. 

I'm not against growing crops. I'm just pointing out that the environmental cost to growing crops is way higher than what most people think VS cattle and any comparison requires an honest look at the data. This is important because vegans like to manipulate this data to make crops look innocent and cattle look terrible. It's important to note that the human diet will always be an omnivore diet. That's what we are. It's unrealistic to think human beings will willing become vegan.

A lot of the gridlock in Washington is over these small issues.  One side wants it one way; the other side wants it another way.  

While there are some issues which can only be one way or another, this current issue of immigration is not one of those.   I think a physical barrier (fence, wall, doesn't matter) in addition to internal checks such as e-verify and overhauling the visa system would be things we could do.   

Currently, the one person that we need to agree to the budget wants ONE thing.  Congress says, ""You open the government, we can talk about the wall.""  The President says, ""Give me funding for the wall, and we can talk about other things.""

That's why I'm not against giving him the wall so that he will shut up and end the shut down, and then once he's done, we can work on ending the longer-term and possibly more serious problem.  
I think it's also an issue of people we haven't checked vs people we have checked.   If you're overstaying your visa, you've had a background check.  The government has no record of that person being a drug smuggler, pedophile, terrorist, or other type of security risk.

Yes, some of them are good people, but it would trouble me if even one of those people coming through unchecked were a fugitive or a known criminal.  Therefore, a lot of people who are in the moderate area, like myself, do see why illegal immigration may be a more immediate issue that should be addressed before, or even while we overhaul the visa system.

If you are trying to clean up a bad neighborhood/area, you are going to stop a lot of good people because it doesn't take that many people to ruin a neighborhood.

To say it simply: I don’t trust the older generations to utilize the technology and information available to them, instead I only trust that the older generations care about being right, at the expense of anything and everything else. Mental health, workplace safety, college tuition. Everything has been impacted by policy put in place over a period of time.

We will likely however ignore you and your demographic while we rebuild it, the only thing you seem to be good at is “scandalizing yourself into victimization.”

I think that a basic safety net for those that suddenly lose their jobs is a good idea. I think that retraining workers for more modern jobs is a good idea.

Don't think I'm someone who looks down on manufacturing jobs either. My area of the country is big for the auto industry. I've had a lot of family work for them, and one still does. They had good pay, good benefits, and could raise a family on that income. They weren't rich, but they weren't poor. They had food, warmth, and occasional luxuries for themselves. I remember all throughout middle and high school anytime someone asked me what I wanted to do, I'd picture that kind of life for my future family. The one my grandfather had, and the one my dad gave me. Working and providing for my kids. I wouldn't be rich, but I wouldn't be poor either. Then the auto crisis of 2008 hit. Bush, Obama, and Congress bailed out that industry and kept those jobs in America. I still had hopes to have a future like my family, but it couldn't be done anymore. My family still working told me that starting wages for new hires was lower now than when they had been hired in the 80s and 90s. Benefits were also different for new hires, being not as good. Also the wage ceiling for the non-managerial jobs was lower than what my family had been making. If I had been hired for the same job as my dad when I turned 18, I'd have made less than him, had worse benefits, and never would have made more than him in salary without a promotion. I would never have been able to give any future kids the childhood I had.

I went to college, but did meh in it. After that, I had the opportunity to apply to one of those auto manufacturing places. I did and they were interested in giving me a job. I was also debating going back to college and taking it seriously. I went for the latter. A year or so afterward, my dad told me he was happy I didn't take the auto job, as the group that had been hired in had been laid off anyway and I would have been back to square one. 

I know what manufacturing jobs can do for families. What they can provide. I also know they're going the way of other jobs of the past where we need fewer of them and they'll be paid less.

I've gotten that too; this was different.

Most were very polite about it, but there's absolutely a xenophobic slant in the country.  ""You must speak Japanese"" was basically the polite way to deny us entry into some clubs/bars.  Not all places were like this and we met a few people who were cool with us but the xenophobic trend was a surprise for me. 

Edit: our ""fixer"" was a friend of a friend who was Indonesian.  He moved from the mainland US to Hawaii and then to Japan.  He is wildly successful and owns several businesses that operate in Japan.  He told us that despite his money and grasp of the language, he still faces discrimination in Japan.

"&gt; https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/19/californians-fed-up-with-housing-costs-and-taxes-are-fleeing-state.html

This article has nothing to do with illegal immigration. The California coast suffers from extremely high housing costs because of its desirable climate, the inherent land constraints of its geography, and the self-inflicted wounds of its insanely over regulated housing market. All of this has led to an extreme housing shortage. This has been highly exacerbated in recent years due to strong economic growth which has been heaviest in the Bay Area - which has seen housing prices double or more since 2010.

California has a major cost of living issue, and its government certainly shoulders much of the blame. But it's a totally separate issue from illegal immigration. Illegal immigrants who come here to work very low paying jobs are not the ones driving the market for $3000 apartments in San Francisco and Los Angeles.",news

"&gt;	Our problem is that the bill does no good and only causes harm. 

It reduces gun sales to people with underdeveloped frontal lobes and creates better communication between mental health institutions, firearms retailers, and local &amp; state law enforcement.  It mandates recent (within 5 years) firearms training for anyone purchasing a semi-auto.

That's a load of good... far more than the harm of not allowing a 20yo to purchase a semi-auto.  It's not like bolt actions and lever actions are trash guns or that a 20yo can't still shoot semi-autos, or that the guns they may currently own are being seized.

&gt;	It only serves to harm those who would follow the law to begin with.

Considering 18% of gun crimes are comitted by the legal owners of the guns, it's a complete fallacy that legal gun owners are always the good guys.  Making a dent in that figure by improving mental health flagging can only help the vast majority of legal gun owners that aren't going to use them criminally.

"You can not do a lot of what you want.  Gun ownership is a right.  Rights do not have prerequisites requiring you to do something you otherwise would not do.  We have decided that the full constitution applies to adults, therefore adults can own guns.  This is already being broken because many places require 21 years of age for hand guns.  It is also being broken by the restrictions on automatics and other arms, the same arms the government uses against us.  Police can use automatics, why can I not?  As for something you would not otherwise do, requiring training.  All I have to do is limit the location and times of the gun ranges that can give you said certificate.  I limit it to one per state, it issues certificates once per year, and only lets one person in per day for one on one instruction.  Only one person per year can get a own a gun.  I have not violated your ""rights"" because the ability to meet the requirement technically exists.  

Mental health assessment?  Who issues them?  What happens when the only person around you allowed to do it is completely anti gun?  I lived in a major city that already had a police chief who would categorically deny any and all civilian requests for any controlled firearm item.  One county north the sheriff would approve them so long as your interview was okay and were not barred already.  He was in office for years and only denied 2.  There was no problems with them at all crime wise.  My brother was in a custody battle and lost visitation with his son he angered the person who did his mental assessment.  In court he asked about the guy's credentials.  This was it, set the guy off.  The guy said it was because he looked sloppy in court.  Ugh, he was wearing business attire and had come straight from work in a professional setting.  Turns out the guy actually did not have the credentials to administer the mental exam.  The person who was supposed to do it was not there but signed off anyway.  Both of these people were investigated immediately after the custody case settled.  I do not know the outcome of that but initially it looked like the actual Dr was going to have his license removed and the underling barred from future practice.

I mean we know he's a lying, manipulating, and likely treasonous problem but since we know that, it's ok? Fighting injustice where and when you see it, at every turn, is the only way to make nasty people feel unsafe and unable to spread their hate.

Hate speech that directly targets a singular or group of people really shouldn't be tolerated, especially when they group of people are largely trying to demonstrate in peace. Once a person or group of people decide to try and impose their beliefs on another, especially in the case of violence, then they should no longer we at right to exercise their ""free speech.""

One thing that bothers me anytime gang related violence involving people who are black is brought up is this idea that they're bringing this on themselves, when in reality, that's the opposite of what these communities want. If you go to black civic organizations, churches, community groups, etc, they're not celebrating that. People are ashamed of prison and gangs and all that. They celebrate students doing well in school and going after their dreams. 

The truth is that anytime you concentrate poverty, the social ills abound, and quality of life is worse for impoverished people in those areas, be that white, black, brown, etc. The truth is that the post WWII white establishment did not want black people to follow them to the suburbs and prosper, so they enacted racial zoning laws among other policies. These things still impact communities today, even post civil Rights act. There is still a long way to go until everyone is reaching their potential in society. And, not that the op did this, but often it happens that people who are white think people who are black have so many more character problems, but when you hold everything else equal, they have the same rates of character problems as people who are white. If you want proof that people who are white in poverty have similar problems, just look at Appalachia for most of America's history. Being white or being black doesn't have an impact on how good/bad your conduct or on the heights of what you're capable of achieving. Your environment, opportunities, education, etc do have an impact though. ",news
"To provide further historical context, I’ll refer you this this fairly lengthy quote, from http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/unamendable.html


Delegates to the Constitutional Convention believed that an article providing for amendments to the Constitution was desirable for two reasons. First, the men assembled in Philadelphia were under no illusions that the constitutional scheme they were struggling to establish was perfect for present circumstances, much less perfect for the future generations of Americans that they hoped would live under it.   Second, they believed that a flexible constitution would provide the protection needed by a young and somewhat fragile government against revolutionary upheavals.  As one delegate said, ""The novelty and difficulty of the experiment requires periodical revision. The prospect of such a revision would also give intermediate stability to the Government.""

The process by which amendments to the Constitution were to be made occupied relatively little of the delegates' time in the early sessions of the Convention. On July 23, 1787, the Convention unanimously agreed to a resolution ""that provision ought to be made for the amendment of the articles of the union, whensoever it shall seem necessary.""  The matter was referred to a committee for the purpose of preparing a draft provision.  There was no indication in the early debates that any provisions in the constitution would not be subject to amendment.

The committee's draft of an article pertaining to the amendment process was not taken up until the closing days of the Convention.  When it finally did become the focus of the delegates' attention on September 10, 1787, a sharp disagreement surfaced. Some delegates feared that the committee's proposal, providing simply that Congress call a convention for the purpose of amending the Constitution when it is requested to do so by two-thirds of the states,  made the amendment process too easy.   Elbridge Gerry, a delegate from Massachusetts, expressed concern that the committee proposal would result in amendments expanding Federal powers at the expense of state powers, and over the objections of as many as one-third of the states.  Other delegates, including Alexander Hamilton, had a different fear: that the committee proposal would make the Constitution unduly rigid.  Hamilton thought the proposal was deficient in that it failed to empower Congress to call a convention on its own?  The states, he said, will apply for alterations only if it will increase their own powers, whereas the national legislature will be the first to perceive, and will be most sensitive to, the need for amendments.

With the committee proposal being attacked as making the amendment process both too easy and too difficult, it is fortunate that there was a James Madison in attendance who was able to offer a proposal that both sides found reasonably satisfactory. Madison's substitute proposal addressed the biggest concern of those who feared subversion of the states by providing that no amendment approved by a convention would become a valid part of the constitution until ratified by three-fourths of the legislatures of the several states.  Hamilton's fear that states would only apply for self-serving amendments was lessened by Madison's proposal that Congress, upon a vote of two-thirds of the members of both Houses, be allowed to propose amendments.

Only after general agreement was reached on the nature of the amendment process was it suggested that the amendment power should be limited in any way as to subject matter. John Rutledge, a delegate from South Carolina, announced that he could not support a document that potentially gave nonslave states the power to amend provisions of the Constitution that denied to the national government the power to prohibit or tax the slave trade.  Rutledge's demand was acceded to in part by the Convention, which agreed to add a proviso to article five prohibiting any amendment prior to 1808 which ""shall in any manner affect"" the provisions of the Constitution relating to slaves.  In making this concession to South Carolina and Georgia, the recent and highly emotional debates between representatives from northern and southern states on the slave issue loomed large in the minds of delegates.  The hope was expressed that after twenty years, the subject might be reconsidered with less difficulty and greater coolness.

On the last business session of the Philadelphia Convention, September 15, 1787, the subject of the amendment process came up again.  Connecticut delegate Roger Sherman voiced his fear that the Constitution as proposed would allow three-fourths of the states to take actions that would be fatal to particular states, such as abolishing them altogether or depriving them of their equal suffrage in the Senate.  In an effort to prevent that from happening, Sherman made a series of motions. His motion to amend the proposed article to provide that no amendment would become effective until it had been ratified by all of the states  failed, with three states voting for it and seven against it.  Sherman's next motion, to prohibit any amendment without the consent of the state, that would affect it in ""its internal police"" or deprive it of its equal suffrage in the Senate,  also failed, this time by a vote of eight to three.  Sherman persisted. His next motion was drastic: to strike the entire article relating to amendments and thus make the entire Constitution unamendable.  Not surprisingly, this motion was also soundly defeated. 
Finally, Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania made the motion that was to result in another proviso being added to article five of the Constitution. Morris argued that the provision guaranteeing to each state equal suffrage in the Senate should not be subject to amendment.  Along with the slave issue, the composition of the Congress had been one of the most divisive issues debated that summer in Philadelphia; a compromise had emerged from seemingly irreconcilable differences.  No one wanted to jeopardize what had been accomplished. Madison described what happened: ""[T]his motion, being dictated by the circulating murmurs of the small states, was agreed to without debate, no one opposing it, or on the question, saying no.""",news

Top post:

This comment, the top comment on the thread makes no effort to differentiate between good cops and bad cops. That's not picking and choosing IMO, that's just looking at the most upvoted post in the thread, what people approve of. In effect people are saying they agree with a generalized statement of ""fuck the police"".

The second highest rated comment in that thread?

They don't fucking care- ""I am the law"".

A user states that ALL cops, *every* law enforcement officer is an entitled, uncaring, egotistical dick. Based on his interactions with what I can only assume is less than 100 officers. And that annoys the shit out of me, when any person with a brain knows it can't be accurate. And yet thousands of people upvoted that post, and the ones supporting the belief in it.

I do think the Democratic Party is every bit as corrupt as the GOP, possibly even more since they seem to have so many gullible dipshits who still back them up. I hate both the parties in the bipartisan system, so what?

Only dumbasses who watch Maddow or Hannity nonstop fall for such stupidity.

4. This is the most baffling post you linked, because it has absofuckinglutely nothing to do with Trump or politics. It's fact. The Nazis didn't exterminate the Jews because they practiced Judaism, they sought to exterminate them because they believed that, like the Slavs, ethnic Jews were biologically inferior and posed a societal threat to them as Aryans.

"I argued none of that. If I argued anything at all, it is simply that more people likely would have died if there was a gun involved. I am not for “stripping” constitutional rights as you seem to imply.

The NHTSA reports that 10,874 people died in 2017 due to drunk driving accidents. The numbers I find for mass shootings deaths in 2017 is ~460. The number of deaths due homicide is ~10,000 in 2017. 

I am not advocating for restricting alcohol. I am saying that both guns and alcohol, by the number of deaths, are about equally dangerous to society.

The thing I can’t understand, is how some people think that having more guns is good. It is like stating more people being drunk is good.

I don’t think banning guns is a good thing, people should be able to defend themselves. But I think that we should be trying to manage better who has access to guns. Why do so many gang members have guns? Can we try to find suppliers better?",news

This is all anecdotal, but I imagine missing persons reports are very common, and it's also likely common for those people to return soon after the report is filed. An example would be a child running away, getting scared and going back home. I'll take it a step further and say that those people probably don't always call the police and report the person found immediately, and the police probably have to follow up with them to find out they are no longer missing. So with that, I can imagine a scenario like this where the cop pulls someone over, sees the missing person, she looks ok, says shes ok, looks like shes out with friends now, she must have been found and not reported found, I'll just take care of it. Either way, there's usually a reason people go missing, and they should need to go to the station and talk with someone to verify they are ok.

"&gt; You obviously don't understand the concept of residency vs citizenship. You also dont seem to understand the importance of citizenship in international law.

How kind of you.

I do understand though that if you live in a country A and the authoritarian government of that country decides that they don't like you that much, they really won't give much crap about what other citizenships you may or may not be holding - the cops that show up at night really won't care all that much what and in which language you'll be trying to yell. The only thing that may matter is whether anyone may come looking for you. So if you don't really matter in the country B of which you claim to be a citizen (but haven't been, lived, worked, or know anyone there), that's unlikely to make any sort of difference for you. Best case scenario you may try to get yourself deported to the country B, but really that's up to that particular authoritarian government on how murderous they feel.

And separately, if you don't really use anything related to your citizenship of a country A, and live and work in a country B, what exactly does the citizenship of the country A do for you in that case? How much of a citizen are you if you don't discharge your duties of a citizen?

In other words, international law may be an interesting aspect, but in individual cases, it's unlikely to be very applicable. Theory =/= practice.

&gt; Countries like Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom etc. Have all placed ""single parent"" rules in their laws.

This is basically all over the place.

1. Most Shengen area countries adjusted their laws when that became a thing for trivial reasons, so bringing all of that up doesn't make sense - it's basically an EU thing. Germany specifically has complex citizenship and naturalization laws for historical reasons.
2. Ireland has a residency requirement as do most (all?) other countries on your list, not a citizenship requirement (also to a large degree an EU thing since otherwise people would use Ireland as a backdoor to EU citizenship); also Ireland has convoluted relationship with UK in that degree (something something no hard border with NI).
3. Spain has even more complicated rules, but it's relatively trivial to get naturalized in Spain if you were born in Spain.

"Sure: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Air_Traffic_Controllers_Organization_(1968)

The strike was declared illegal, the employees who didn't return were fired and banned from federal jobs for life and the union was disbanded by the government.

&gt;At 7 a.m. on August 3, 1981, the union declared a strike, seeking better working conditions, better pay, and a 32-hour workweek (a four-day week and an eight-hour day combined). In addition, PATCO wanted to be excluded from the civil service clauses that it had long disliked. In striking, the union violated 5 U.S.C. (Supp. III 1956) 118p (now 5 U.S.C. § 7311), which prohibits strikes by federal government employees. **After supporting PATCO's effort in his 1980 campaign, Ronald Reagan declared the PATCO strike a ""peril to national safety"" and ordered them back to work under the terms of the Taft–Hartley Act.** Only 1,300 of the nearly 13,000 controllers returned to work. Subsequently, at 10:55 a.m., Reagan included the following in a statement to the media from the Rose Garden of the White House: ""Let me read the solemn oath taken by each of these employees, a sworn affidavit, when they accepted their jobs: 'I am not participating in any strike against the Government of the United States or any agency thereof, and I will not so participate while an employee of the Government of the United States or any agency thereof.'"" He then demanded those remaining on strike return to work within 48 hours, otherwise their jobs would be forfeited. At the same time, Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis organized for replacements and started contingency plans. By prioritizing and cutting flights severely, and even adopting methods of air traffic management that PATCO had previously lobbied for, the government was initially able to have 50% of flights available.


&gt;**On August 5, following the PATCO workers' refusal to return to work, Reagan fired the 11,345 striking air traffic controllers who had ignored the order, and banned them from federal service for life.** In the wake of the strike and mass firings, the FAA was faced with the task of hiring and training enough controllers to replace those that had been fired, a hard problem to fix as, at the time, it took three years in normal conditions to train a new controller. They were replaced initially with non-participating controllers, supervisors, staff personnel, some non-rated personnel, and in some cases by controllers transferred temporarily from other facilities. Some military controllers were also used until replacements could be trained. The FAA had initially claimed that staffing levels would be restored within two years; however, it took closer to ten years before the overall staffing levels returned to normal. **PATCO was decertified by the Federal Labor Relations Authority on October 22, 1981.** The decision was appealed.",news

"Remember, the poor in Venezuela are poor because of socialist policy. But American policy can't make you poor!. In America if you are poor, or die from lack of healthcare, it's because your lazy! /s

Never mind that totalitarian regimes come in all sizes capitalist (see in CIA backed coup) or socialist (see any republican talking point.)

Also, lets not forget that while not technically socialist but pretty far left from America are the 3,4,5 largest economies. So it's not like they are at the very bottom of the ranking.

VITIATION OF EARLIER PROCEEDINGS - Mr. Hoyer asked unanimous consent to vacate proceedings by which House Joint Resolution 28 was passed, and the motion to reconsider laid upon the table, to the end that the Chair put the question on passage of House Joint Resolution 28 de novo, and further that if a recorded vote or the yeas and nays are ordered on the question of passage of House Joint Resolution 28, further proceedings may be postponed through the legislative day of January 23, 2019, as though under clause 8 of rule 20.

"The longer video shoes the that the indian guy walks between and then turns towards the kid and walks right up to one of them and gets about 4 inches from his face.  He wasn't trying to diffuse the situation, he picked sides.  

The teen stood there and said nothing and did nothing provocative.  

Phillips approached with his own camera person following him, he got into the teens face, he lied about the incident to the media afterwords.  Based on that it seems to me that he was attempting to get the students to react to him in hopes of creating an incident.  

As far as the other kids, when the native american group approaches you can see them dancing along with the drum beat laughing and smiling.  You can also see members of the native american group dancing with the drum beats and smiling.  You can also see several of the people that were holding up their cameras filming were dancing along with the drum beats.  It's obvious that the teens didn't initially realize that the native american group was approaching to be antagonistic and based on the mannerisms of some of the other members of the native american group neither did they.   It was the leader of the group looking to create an incident.

It's really sad that teenagers dancing to drums has been interpreted as mocking the native americans, but that's where we are.  I'm guessing it is just people that were ready to murder these teens, that they weren't totally wrong.  

The people keep saying the teens were doing tomahawk chops like that is some symbol of racism.  Why do we keep inventing new symbols of racism that aren't.  First it was pepe the frog, then it was OK symbol, now it's the tomahawk chop.  These kids weren't mocking the native americans, they were being teenagers having fun dancing to a beat.  

But let's pretend for a moment that teens didn't behave absolutely perfectly.  Why are you calling for a bunch of teenagers heads on a pike and giving the grown adults that engaged them and called them pedophiles, ni##ers, cra@@ers, and telling them to go back to europe a total pass?",news
"&gt;Tell that to the kids working in sweatshops building phones and sewing shoes to sustain the lavish lives of those billionaires. 

At what point do we blame the consumer who buys those things? Like, I'm betting, you.

The reason they do that is because consumers want the cheap products. If the millionaires didn't do it, someone else would and simply replace them. Same way drug dealers don't seem to disappear despite..what 40 years of a drug war? Someone will fill the void.

At some point if the issue is to mean anything - we as a society have to take the blame and instead of a $50 dollar shoes, we have to buy the $200 pair that are the same quality. We won't do it because we want to consume more for less, but that's how you end sweatshops. Society stops buying from them.

"The thing that gets me is that the hot takes in this thread don't even add up to the edited video. It was a man drumming in another dudes face. Neither of them moving or doing anything. How does that equate to either one of them being racist, etc? Reading these comments, you'd think the student was hurling racist vitriol to the Native American man, but he literally just stood there! And then there were talks of expulsion, death threats... I didn't get the reaction then and it seems even worse now that the full video is circulating. ",news

Shooting a 14 year old who isn't holding a real gun is NOT KEEPING THE PUBLIC SAFE.

Why can't you understand that?

You completely ignored the psychological aspect of my entire comment and that explain the entire point.

You're also saying that it's the kid fault for getting shot. That's always the final defense of gun defenders and it's appalling. 

Let me spell it out again.

The reason that the kid died is not because he broke into a car, do you know why not? Not all kids that break into a car get shot.

The officer decided to shoot, that's why the kid died. Why did the officer decide that? Because he felt like his own life (or a bystanders life) was in danger. Why did he feel like that? Because of how common guns are in the US.

It's that simple.",news

"&gt;i'm all for cutting $5 billion in programs to fund the wall. We don't need to fund arts, thats dumdum nonsense. we don't need to fund planned parenthood. between those two, i just found over a billion. 

Thanks for proving you don't look at data or impact when making these decisions. Your support of the wall makes a lot more sense now.

&gt;this is all completely political. Americans voted for a wall in 2016. Dems ran against wall and lost in 2016. You dont' want to give trump his wall. the dems are holding 800k hostage to prevent trump from getting a ""win"".

1. The wall was not up for election. Trump was, and the electoral college voted him in.

2. Just because you win an election, doesn't give you the right to overrule other branches of government. Unless you think Republicans were so wrong for opposing the ACA. 

3. I would hope they would since we shouldn't be fucking over the citizenry just so someone can get a ""win"". This is politics, not a bunch of children playing tag.

&gt;he stands on the right side this time. the left was pro-wall for years, and now that it's trump they are anti-wall. completely political.

No he's not. Not in any sense is he right. Not fiscally (which I thought conservatives cared about before Trump showed up), logically (a fence already exists), and logistically (illegal border crossings have been going down since 2007 and overstayed VISA's make up the largest portion of illegal immigration since 2007). The left was not pro-wall. They voted for a fence, that went in. The fence was to cover areas that were weaker. It had a purpose and was backed up by data.

You're right it is politically. Conservatives are all about saving money, unless they can make money off it. ""hell yeah build the wall!"" Conservatives didn't care about the southern border until Trump came a long. ""Hell yeah, build the wall!"" Conservatives cared about individuals property rights until Trump told them about the scary brown people. ""Hell yeah, build the wall!"". Yes, it's entirely political and conservatives are too stupid to realize who is a getting played.

While it's still possible, if you were a psychos' target, it's unlikely being armed yourself would help your chances at all. He'll have a bullet in your head from half a mile away before you even hear the gunshot go off. The ""good guy with a gun stops the bad guys"" is a load of horse crap.

"&gt; Oh I don't know, news reports suggesting that their testing methodology is flawed and their data may be skewed.

In your own article the institute agrees that they would like to see more doctors respond. They can't really force that though.

""We're absolutely clear about the fact that this is a survey,"" said Bacchus Barua, one of the authors of the report. ""This is not something we can control. We would love it if we had more responses.""

1/5 doctors in Canada responded which is a pretty good representation for a survey IMO.

&gt;Their wiki page and other sources also suggest political biases in their findings, which would definitely skew what results they'd publish.

From Wikipedia
""It has been described as politically conservative[1][2][3] and libertarian.[4][5]""

Oh no, those darn Conservatives are known liars, even though I can't really prove any bias there must be some!

Your ""other sources"" link literally says they publish factual information. They might use buzz words but that doesn't really have anything to do with the numerical stats I posted. 

Reddit comments aren't proper sources when the comment doesn't even cite anything I'm afraid.
