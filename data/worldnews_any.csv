"&gt; but why are over 80% of vegetarians B12 deficient then?

Because most of the world is. It's not just a vegan problem. Supplementation has been shown to be effective which is why everybody, vegan or not, should supplement. There's no need to torture animals, destroy the environment and endanger your own health to get a vitamin that you can easily obtain through a supplement.

&gt; Humans have always been omnivores.

That's an appeal to nature fallacy. It's irrelevant. If we observe that meat is bad for our health it doesn't matter if we've been omnivores for millions of years. It's still bad for us. The science is what matters.

Again, from the American dietetic association:

&gt; The results of an evidence-based review showed that a vegetarian diet is associated with a lower risk of death from ischemic heart disease. Vegetarians also appear to have lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, and lower rates of hypertension and type 2 diabetes than nonvegetarians. Furthermore, vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index and lower overall cancer rates. Features of a vegetarian diet that may reduce risk of chronic disease include lower intakes of saturated fat and cholesterol and higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, soy products, fiber, and phytochemicals.

"Its not that complex. Here's a basic schematic of a not very efficient yet functional nuclear bomb: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Man#Interior

The trick is to cut all of the detonator wires to the same length. Make sure all explosives go off at the exact same time. And make sure you're using reliable explosives. They all must detonate simultaneously.

Aside from that just copy a soccer ball type tiled explosives, surround the sphere with fissile material, and you now have a nuclear bomb.

Don't like that design? Want another stupid simple design? Got you covered: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy#Assembly_details

The challenging part is getting the nuclear core in the first place. Getting that much enriched fissile material is the only thing stopping people from building nuclear weapons in their garages.

The other hard part is delivery. Okay, lets say you go down to your local corner store and buy some plutonium. Now what? You've got a nuclear bomb sitting in your garage. Its not going to do you much good unless you just want to blow yourself up. You also need a delivery mechanism.

Eyewitness claims attacker shouted 'Allah'

Sam Clack, a BBC producer, was on a platform at Manchester Victoria railway station waiting for a tram when he witnessed the attack.
British Transport Police (BTP) confirmed three people, including a police officer, was injured in the stabbing.
Mr Clack, 38, said: “I just heard this most blood curdling scream and looked down the platform.
“What it looked like was a guy in his 60s with a woman of similar age and another guy all dressed in black.
“It looked like they were having a fight but she was screaming in this blood curdling way.
“I saw police in high-viz come towards him.
“He came towards me. I looked down and saw he had a kitchen knife with a black handle with a good, 12 inch blade.
“It was just fear, pure fear.”
Mr Clack, on his way to catch a tram home, said police officers used a Taser and pepper spray before, “six or seven” officers jumped on the man.
Mr Clack, who is from Newcastle but is working in Manchester for the BBC, said as the suspect was held down, he said: “As long as you keep bombing other countries this sort of shit is going to keep happening.”
He said it looked like both the man in his 60s and the woman with him had been stabbed but both were conscious and were walked to a waiting ambulance.
BTP said they were called at 8.52pm to reports of man with a knife who has been detained.
Two members of the public have been taken to hospital with knife injuries and a BTP officer is being treated for a knife wound to the shoulder.

Almost all of the doctors who ever took these ""bribes"" are all still alive and practicing. EVERYONE who died because of these pill pushers are still very dead. We're just supposed to forget about it and forgive them because the law MADE them stop?

"&gt; it's a known carcinogen and causes cancer.

First one is not true, IARC rank Glyphosate as a probable carcinogen (2A), not known one (1). It's also the only safety agency to do so, all others classify it as safe.

Also being a carcinogen doesn't mean it will cause cancer. For example alcohol is a known carcinogen (IARC group 1), yet if you drink only one small glass every week it won't have any bad effect as the dose is too low to be dangerous. 

This is the difference between hazard and danger. IARC ranks with regards to the hazard, meaning the potential to cause harm, the EPA ranks according to the danger, will it cause harm if used normally. For example electricity in your home is a big hazard, it could straight up kill you in a few second, but a very low risk.

So since alcohol is a known carcinogen and cause cancer (amongst other complications), should we also ban it? Red meat is also a 2A according to the IARC and hot water too.",worldnews

I know it's kinda hard to believe since ur small leftist brain can't even fantom we're in Inter-glacial stage of an Ice age. During a full cycle the temperature swings by an average of 7°C. Other orbital variations that the planet goes through can amplify or attenuate the effects of obliquity such that the normal temperature range falls between 6°C and 8°C. Much more impressive are the full ice-age cycles, these are tied to the orbit of the entire solar system around the galactic centre and have a periodicity of about 125 million years. During a full cycle the average temperature of Earth will range from 4°C at the coolest to 35°C at it’s warmest. ***During the cold phase all but the Equatorial Region of the planet will be frozen solid.

The programs that I work in are successful. Not only do they achieve the intended goals, but they have been renewed budget after budget and shutdown after shutdown, for almost 20 years and counting through 3 administrations. They help to save an aging grid that needs significant upgrades or load reductions to make way for renewables. These programs get audited and renewed every cycle, and unlike most government operations they are completely merit based. They also have to be renewed at the state level, almost every state has had the state-side municipality initiative in place and renewed just as frequently. They were budgeted based on predicted merit at their inception and have proven their continued ability to meet expanded benchmarks going on 10 times over. The fact that a project has verifiable and directly measurable impacts and survives government shutdowns/budget battles is testament to its success, which makes it *essential*. It is how ALL policy initiatives should be run. We wouldn't be able to lead the world in emissions reduction without this type of direct action program.

Now, you might say ""but how to they tell each other how many of something there is?"" and the answer could be ""they dont need to"".  

They concept of a static system could potentially not exist.  The could understand relations of physics and communication in an intuitively dynamic way, where the idea of saying what something ""is"" makes absolutely no sense.  Their language and ""math"" could be entirely within the context of blurred lines and moving parts.  

Think about how you are able to spice your food without actually measuring or quantifying the amount of spice you use.  Now consider that even when we do 'measure' our spices, we are still rounding - we are not counting every atom.  Maybe the only reason we have math is because we are super dumb and effectively need to count on our fingers while an alien race may have no need for this.  Maybe they understand things on an inherently scale-able level, and communicate as such. Like when people talk to each other in tongues or read between the lines - but on steroids.

"I mean, absolutely. But all individual change does is delay the inevitable. It'll give us a little more time, but that's not where the ultimate answer lies.

Unless we completely change our economic system, climate change won't get solved, or at least remedied enough. We have an economy that necessitates infinite growth. How is that ever possible to sustain on a finite planet? It simply doesn't add up. And unless that changes, the problem remains.

Everyone on earth could change their lives to be completely sustainable. But in 30-40 years at most, the problem would return,  as our economic system would almost force us to expend, forever and ever, into ever greater level of consumption if possible, or massively increasing the population, undoing all progress done in those years. Because growth is the best way to get an ever higher profit and profit margins, and companies and investors would basically attack that sustainable living in favor of more consumerism, just as it does at this very day and the earlier decades. There is no coincidence that anthropocentric climate change denial, or at least dismissal as anything to worry about, is so extensive today.

Don't take me wrong, individual action to reduce one's carbon footprint is very welcome and helps as every other little bit does. You decision to stop eating meat today could save a life from ending early in the future because of climate reasons. But the problem won't go away unless we change our economy to accommodate for this, with the primary change having to be to stop the need for growth, and preferably initiating controlled degrowth, a massive reduction in our rampant consumerism today.

Because really, the alternative is the extinction of the human race. Or at the very least the death of the majority of the human population, with endless streams of migrants from climates destroyed by climate change, resource wars for basic supplies like food and water, and tensions higher than at the peak point in the cold war.

There is no choice here. It's change or die. Humanity could do so much wonderful if we just worked together. But instead, it's humanity for the economy, and not the economy for humanity. And if we don't change *now*, we will fail.

The great project of human civilization will fail.",worldnews

"Current breaks and cages on components like microprocessors, isolation transformers and related on anything grid connected (1:1 transformers that blow in the event of a surge). The amount of current induced is proportional to the length of the wire, so the biggest thing is not to be plugged in.  After that the second biggest danger is to things that can't handle even a small voltage (like processors).  I'm not an electrical engineer by trade, but I know for most things the wire length just isn't long enough to induce a massive current unless you're close enough to the nuclear blast that you have other things to worry about.  So basically you're just trying to make sure the microprocessors don't see much current (instead of a component designed for microamps suddenly seeing a 5A current) and keeping yourself away from the disaster the grid is about to become.

On a fun note, for our 300 or so biggest transformers the lead time on a replacement parts is about 3 years, and if they went down our backup plan to keep the vast majority of the United States with electricity is to stick our thumbs up our butts.  Without electricity and grid infrastructure we'd have about 3 days worth of food for the majority of Americans, then starvation kicks in.

Imagine if the EU as an entity decided that is what is best for the union and will ignore domestic laws so that their pipeline can pump and get to Eastern Europe. Hungarians defending their lands, yes they are protesters, but they are also land defenders. More so because Wet'suwet'en, who are protecting their country called **Yin'tah**, know the leak and explosion potential of pipelines and are dealing with things like sensitive marine habitats and old growth forests. They are protecting Yin'tah; they are defending their lands. And they have laws in Yin'tah against putting pipelines in, though the Canadian government is peeved because the government they are trying to force on Wet'suwet'en (aka the elected band council) is being rejected through their traditional government which has a very different way of functioning

Also, imagine if European Union were to have a centralised police force, then sent their forces into Hungary to arrest those Hungarian land defenders. Hungary is hardly a part of the full EU, and it gets worse if that EU police force were to go into like Ukraine and arrest Ukrainians. The thing is, many BC court decisions have shown that BC is an illegal occupier of Yin'tah and its neighbour Lax̱yip (the Gitx̱san country), and these defenders are defending their proper countries.

Hell, if you don't like China, look at Europe. Europe is also much much more densely populated (about 5x the population density of the US).

&gt; Also the chinese economic model isn't really that successful and has caused various negative social issues like a terrible shrinking birthrate, malinvestment of resources, environmental issues, and malinvestment of economic capital to loss making activities, such as just making steel beyond market demand.

I'm not saying that we should take the Chinese model wholesale. I am saying that their immigration policy is a smart idea. We did something similar in the past, called the homestead act.

The idea you have to develop missile to avoid missile defense is a joke because anyone in their right mind would just fire more missile. 

All the scenarios just end in everybody make missiles as fast as they can and the US will always win that game by a mile. It comes down to industrial production and Russia just doesn't have it. 

Missile shields and fast missiles are all defense contract fluff. It doesn't matter if you get a missile through the shield or hit a couple target rapidly. You don't know where the missile bases are, thus you can only target them with a blanket nuclear attack.

Nothing has changes since the advent of assured mutual destruction when it comes to missiles, missile shields and faster missiles. You can't blow up a nation fast enough to stop a nuclear strike more than capable of ending your nation, so it's just stupid to even pretend that kind of tech is going to be useful. 

It's also stupid to pretend you need some kind of scramjet nuclear bomber or subs any more capable of launching nuclear missiles, because you could already destroy the entire world, so adding to that really doesn't do a damn thing.

"We shouldn't have blind faith in doctors. They practice a set of protocols from teachings that evolve over time. These teachings were wrong many times and we *never* seem to learn that lesson. Much of their teachings are corrupted by monetary incentives to sell treatment of disease rather than convey the actual truth or the more permanent solutions.

My appendix was removed due to a misdiagnosed kidney stone. My toe nail was removed and cauterized, but it grew back worse than before. They do screw up. 

I've said no to doctors a few times. They told me to take Travatan to reduce eye pressure, but it would have costed more than $100 per month and my eye pressures were only borderline. Cha ching denied.

It's not the doctors that are so much in the wrong here, but what they are taught and the incentives behind it. I see them more as they are, my peers, but with a lot of education in a flawed profit seeking system. 

I have my own expertise with computers and I can see how the dynamic of being impressed by another's knowledge can lead to misplaced faith. To me, computer technicians vary in skill at diagnosing and fixing problems. It's the same with mechanics. 

Doctors are the same, but our faith in them allows them to screw up, screwing us up. If we shouldn't place such blind faith in computer technicians or car mechanics, why should we place blind faith in the diagnosers and fixers of disease in our bodies? It's folly. ",worldnews

As a whole (and correct me if i'm wrong, i'm not american) people in the states vote based on ideology and the voting turnout changes depending on the popularity of the running candidate. 

Most parliamentary democracies have several parties, each contending to get the biggest slice of influence in the government, and they have to form alliances with other parties sharing their core issues.

Supplies and men were shipped to build roads and reconnect the coasts with emergency facilities in the center of the country. The US was the sole country offering Chávez support.

"I was kind of hoping somebody would mention Iran because my mother is Iranian. 

Iran had its democratically elected government overthrown in 1953. In 1953, the life expectancy was about 35. The average women had 7 children. The vast majority were uneducated and rural. The median income was below 500 a year (adjusted for inflation of course), about 1/3rd that of *india* today. Is that a rich country? 

Even around the time the Shah was overthrown, it was still a very poor country. It had a VERY rich upper class, mostly rich from oil exports, but the other 95% of the country lived in horrific conditions. That was arguably the biggest reason behind the 1978-1979 protests, they were mostly socialist at first in nature due to the horrible inequality in Iran. While the rich in Iran lived well off, secular lives in Tehran, much of the country still lived in conditions similar to [this.](https://i.imgur.com/WVu4m4u.jpg)

While the current regime is atrociously bad in terms of human rights, the country has become richer and more equal and more cosmopolitan in a huge way since 1979. The average amount of kids per mom went from 6 to 1.6, lower than most western countries. The percentage of 25 year old women who are educated in higher education rose from less than 3% to over 60%. The median income for the bottom 90% of the country has risen dramatically above its previous level. 

In terms of the headscarf situation... its fucked up, nobody denies that. But [relatively fashionable outfits such as these](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c3b6b49a048529587dc87f6cf8bd5d6e) can now be seen in most major cities in Iran among the regular population. That would have been considered only for the VERY VERY rich under the Shah. 

Anyways I am kind of ranting, but the trope that Iran was some rich nice place before the current regime is so commonly said on Reddit, its infuriating. The shah was fucking atrocious for the poor. The previous democratic government was good, but it was too early to truly see many changes in the country unfortunately. ",worldnews

also, you're making a lot of assumptions. For one, you're using the word deceived, which implies a deceiver. No deception is necessary for you to not be able to trust your senses. All that's required is that you can think of a hypothetical situation in which what you sense doesn't match reality.

Look man, you can say that you believe science is the more rational choice, or that it's more consistent, both with results and itself. Hell, that's what I think. But when I tell you that it is impossible to prove, I mean that it has been mathematically/logically proven that you cannot make either guarantee, that the future will be like the past, or that your senses grant you accurate data. This isn't an opinion thing, it's fact. You can look it up yourself if you want.

For example, lets say aliens are watching our planet right now, and have erected an invisible bubble around our solar system that makes physics behave differently inside, while painting a picture of a cosmos outside that acts the same way. Until we discover this, we believe our physics to accurately represent the universe, and it's impossible to prove that it doesn't until the situation changes.

[Here's](https://cosmosmagazine.com/physics/vacuum-decay-ultimate-catastrophe) a great example.

"Profit is not economics.

Bringing up tax incidence is not about defending google’s profits, but recognizing that the financial burden of the tax does not fall purely or even mostly on the entity that bears the tax by statute. It can also fall on workers and consumers, according to the relative elasticities of supply and demand in the relevant consumer and labor markets.

Dead weight loss has to do with the shrinking value produced in the economy in total as the result of a tax’s incentive distortion. This is not by itself cause to reject a tax, provided that the incidence falls appropriately and those distortions are acceptable (or even desired, in the case of Pigouvian taxes that price externalities like carbon emissions or road wear into the market). It is, however, something to consider when evaluating a tax regime against its alternatives.

Finally, there is the nature of international exchange. Where a company realizes taxes is relevant when it’s products and revenues are used and made around the world. Withholding taxes attempt to account for this, and tax credits seek to adjust for the disincentive to fund repatriation that withholding taxes can represent.

When you see headlines like this, it’s easy to equate it with just dodging out of paying their due like any other Joe. But the incidence and incentive distortions of corporate taxes, payroll taxes, etc aren’t necessarily the same as those for sales taxes or income taxes (which again, are not only borne by workers and consumers but also by employers and suppliers due to the effect in my first paragraph.

And so yes, due to the not-so-simple economic nature of taxes, the morality of tax implementation and of how to structure a company within a given tax structure are likewise not so simple.",worldnews

&gt; PARIS - France&amp;#039;s embattled president, Emmanuel Macron, vowed on Monday to press on with his reform agenda in 2019 despite a spate of &amp;quot;Yellow vest&amp;quot; protests that have challenged his government and extended a plunge in his approval ratings.

&gt; Confounding some expectations of a more contrite message, Macron struck an unapologetic note as he urged voters to face up to economic realities underpinning recently enacted reforms of French labor rules, and others yet to come.

&gt; Macron said efforts to bolster international controls on immigration and tax evasion would be at the heart of European Union proposals he plans to announce in &amp;quot;Coming weeks&amp;quot; - to be pursued in parallel with a domestic agenda reconciling ambitious reform with France&amp;#039;s commitment to social solidarity.

"&gt; Once you factor in absurd healthcare costs

Yes they are high and it's a problem but close to 90% of people have employer provided insurance. It's a trade off, in countries where healthcare is free the taxes are roughly double that of the US, so they pay for it too just in a different way. 

&gt; plus the overall tax rate Americans do not make more money

Ridiculous. I just gave you the data that after tax, Americans do make significantly more money than people in any developed country. Taxes in the US are comparatively [very low](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/Screen%20Shot%202014-04-14%20at%202.29.23%20PM.png).

&gt; And they also end up paying more for stuff like transportation than Euros.

Really? Gasoline costs $1.85 per gallon (3.8 liters) where I live right now. How much is it in Europe, around $6-7? It's about $4 in Canada. Air and other transportation tickets are not any more expensive in the US than in Europe. Sorry, but where  do you get your information from, facebook?

"I don’t think it’s disinformation as much as it is realism.

It’s just not in the cards for Bernie, I personally love the guy and his policies, but he’s a bad candidate for this moment in time.

A lot of republicans and right leaning moderates that Trump has alienated will run right back to the GOP, as soon as the start hearing the word “socialist”. He needs these votes. Despite the fact that the fix was in regardless of the results with the DNC, Sanders still lost the instance vote nationwide before the delegates voted. Basically despite what the Bernie fans scream he lost to Clinton fairly before she even had a chance to instigate the rig. Grass roots will only take you so far in a National Election, and it doesn’t earn you purple states.

Also.....Bernie is a gentleman. Trump will clean his clock in a debate because he allows himself to be interrupted, and prides himself on playing fair, and truthful. Trump cares about neither of those things and will just rant on and on. The result will be “Look at the crazy shit Trump just said!” plastered all over the news while Bernie gets no coverage because he’s not buzzworthy. Whoever the DNC goes with needs to be able and willing to verbally box with Trump and call him out loudly and proudly on his bullshit.

I love Bernie, but he’s better off as a VP candidate. Any other time, against any other nominee and I would love to see him run, but it just isn’t his moment anymore.

Also this is the time for the Dems to unite. They’ve cleaned house at the DNC, they have an unpopular GOP president, and they’re coming off a huge midterm. An overly fierce primary could muddy the water just like it did for the GOP when Trump emerged. The dems can’t give up their knockout blow to an ugly primary that weakens the eventual candidate.",worldnews

And an economic distinction - Latin America has historically been poor throughout the 20th century. Now some countries (Chile, Uruguay etc) are starting to really catch up.

It's also kind of a racist and cultural distinction. Latino, Hispanic, Jamaican, Haitian etc were historically seen as non-white and the other (even if they actually were of white European background as many Latino people are).

"As I clearly conveyed, there are angels and demons on every shade of the wealth spectrum. 

Jealous? I want enough money to live comfortably, and have my freedom. I can tell you right now I wouldn't be buying ridiculous cars and mansions. If given the choice between spending 200k on a fucking piece of shit car, or distributing 50k each to four people who could really use it, I will always choose the latter. I do not want a cold, hollow house with too many rooms that don't get used, I don't want to walk into stores and have people suck up to me because they think I'll haemorrhage notes. Another point of note is that most rich people I've met have an aura of misery surrounding them, at least 50%. The thought of having some of the things they have actually turns my stomach in disgust, it doesn't flutter my heart with excitement.

Do they want employees to quit? No, because it isn't cost effective. You can't profit off of society if it does not exist. They don't want people to have a hard time, they simply don't give a shit if they have a hard time. At a point, low wages reap greater revenue in spite of a slightly higher churn rate. There's a balance between the cost of training new employees and benefit of having low hourly rates. They don't care about the environment because the consequences of neglect will come after their time. So many kids these days face an uphill battle to simply afford property these days. Battles that didn't exist over 30 years ago. They want a high paying job? They need experience to get it, and they need the job to get the experience, on top of that expensive and over-saturated degree they were sold(but that's beside the point). Those high paying jobs that orbit high cost of living areas. Companies aren't willing to build affordable property, why do that when you can build disgracefully overpriced apartment blocks and have foreign investment take it all, leaving a mostly vacant building to stand monument to corporate greed? 

Sure, you can get ahead. I don't believe people have no control over their own lives. They can make better decisions, and if you have no money, more often then not it's no one else fault but your own. I was born fairly middle class, and I have a pretty good paying career. Basically, I have a mild advantage and still it isn't easy. But in my job, due to the locale, I see it all, from the blue bloods to the 55 year old, still working full time single mother, who can't afford a pot to piss in or a window to toss it out of. Her kid can still make something of himself, but how fucking hard must it be for him to get a leg up? With absolutely no safety net behind him? The answer is harder than it needs to be, and owed in part, to the 1%'ers and their dog eat dog modus operandi. I can only speculate that an easy, soft-hand life spent with people generally kissing your ass often does not build much in the way of admirable character. 

The key to my disdain is simple. If you aren't prepared to care for others, don't expect me to give a shit about you. The kind of people who walk straight past a guy who's tripped over without offering a hand are filth, and the rich lend themselves to that category of vermin explicitly and implicitly with their behaviour.

"Sorry mate, I'm a full-fledged Filipino, born and raised. Still live here.

&gt; The Catholic Church is still DOMINANT in most people’s lives.

It's definitely a huge factor. But if I ask 10 random strangers how much they care about the Catholic Church, they'd probably answer the usual: go to church on Sundays (and not every Sunday, and even then mostly just to either keep up appearances or find dates lol), make the sign of the cross when travelling when they pass by a church (not always, and which I personally find ridiculous), and generally just find it pervasive. I guess that's the right word: pervasive.

&gt; You get married by the Catholic Church.

You don't need to. Me and my wife and about a hundred other couples got married at the same time via court. No church needed.

&gt; ...explicitly because they can not get divorced under the Catholic Church and they don’t want their children to become bastards with an annulment!!

They cannot get divorced because it's not legal here. That's it. The Catholic Church is fighting tooth and nail to not let divorce be legal, sure, but bottom-line is, if it did become legal (many are seeing it happening in the next few years), these people would get divorce. Also, aside from annulment there's just what's called ""legal separation,"" which makes it like the marriage never actually happened.

&gt; You don’t get more Catholic than that...

Yes, you do, but I'll grant you your hyperbole. lol

&gt; Until Aquino came to power, contraceptives were illegal - you could get them only via US military bases distributing them!

You seem to be arguing about the Catholic Church's **influence**, which is pretty much the same as what I was saying. When I say ""culturally"" Catholic, I mean the religion is so pervasive in our every day lives that there's no getting away from it. When you say **DOMINANT** I get the ISIS Islamic State feeling and we're nowhere near that.

Last point: please don't assume you know where I'm from or what I know.

What Guaido is doing is 100% backed by the Venezuelan constitution and it is perfectly legal. Here's a quick recap from last year of how we got to today: Basically last year Maduro did two things that brought us here. First, he tried to implement a new constitution out of thin air, and the people didn't want (constitution that would help him stay in power), and he also did an illegitimate and illegal election and moved them to an earlier date in may (they're usually in December) and fixed those elections so he could win them. Since those elections were illegitimate then that means Venezuela was left without a president in January of this year, and by the current constitution the next in power is the speaker of the house (or in Venezuelan terms, the president of the National Assembly, aka Juan Guaido). So no, it is not a coup, and Guaido is the interim president of Venezuela at the moment.

"I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how capitalism works.  The more intelligent, productive people there are, the more value can be produced, the more wealth there is to go around.  

An intelligent, self-interested, rational business person would be interested in funding and spreading the technology to make more skilled workers available.  It would be part of the same capitalist impulse that saw women enter the workforce.  

A tax funded government program just seems like an inefficient way of implementing things to me.  I would much rather it be organic, so that it could be as free of partisan politics as possible and focus as early as possible on productivity enhancing genetic modifications.  I'm not saying health modifications are bad or even simply less desirable overall than productivity enhancers, I just want as much wealth produced as quickly as possible so that technical progress can be made as quickly as possible.  

Know that I'm no corporatist.  Corporations have been in bed with the government creating regulations that effectively create feudal fiefdoms over various markets that corporate oligarchs control, with barriers to entry created by regulation that the common man cannot overcome.  It's anti-competitive and anti-capitalist.  I feel that the ""elite capitalists"" you fear are the corporatists that I hate.  Perhaps some of the more evil among them would act in the way you describe.

However, A also equals (A)sshole, and V also equals (V)agina; resulting in A = asshole, and V = vagina. 

As only men have assholes, and females vagina, we result in the following equations: 

Male = A(buser) = (A)sshole; A = A

Female = (V)ictim = (V)agina; V = V

As females do not have assholes, it is therefore mathematically impossible for females to be abusers as:

I am making *assertions* of *certainty* based on both the Framers' *explicit intent* and hundreds of years of jurisprudence, and the leeway available. There is no leeway in this particular example.

This is very much how law works, and I can quote you a dozen law professors and legal experts right now explaining why this means a treason conviction is not only absolutely unattainable, but would also require a violation of another bedrock principle of law: ex post facto.

So, the probability of Trump or any in his circle getting charged with ""treason"" is the same probability that Obama was indeed born in Kenya, or that Michelle is secretly his gay lover: next to nil.

This document alone comprises more than 600 pages. I doubt if you read much of it, let alone understand much of it, but you've probably skimmed some news reports *discussing* these filings. There are no treason charges: had the preconditions been met, there would have already been such charges. 

If Mueller brought such charges, they would unquestionably be defeated, perhaps even dismissed as frivolous.

I am emphatically *not* ""basing this assumptions"" [sic] and you don't have the slightest clue what you're even talking about.

"Do you know how many Apple served ads I see on a daily basis? 

Like 4. And they’re not even targeted well. It’s like on Reddit mobile, the same two or three ads over and over. 

That’s why I’m not buying what you’re selling. 

For me, the proof is in the pudding. I use Amazon, I get ads for everything I looked at. I use google, I get ads for everything I look up. I use Facebook... well, I just don’t use Facebook. 

I use Apple, and I don’t see anything change based on my usage. So either they’re terrible at it, which would be good, or they’re just not doing it, which is better. Either way, I win.

And I’m not even paranoid about my privacy. I opt in to everything. I keep location tracking on. I like where technology is heading. I just don’t want to see ads for shit I have no intention of buying because I looked at it once. That’s annoying. 

Edit to add...

I just did a little experiment. In the iOS News app, where the bulk of Apple’s advertising is served, I saw one for the Golden Globes on NBC(happening live, right now), one for the Apple TV app which is installed by default and free to use, and a third one failed to load.

That’s the level that Apple’s in house ad service operates on.

“Maduro's loss of popularity saw the election of an opposition-led National Assembly in 2015 and a movement toward recalling Maduro in 2016, though Maduro still maintains power through loyal political bodies, such as the Supreme Court, National Electoral Council and the military.

After entering a constitutional crisis when the Supreme Tribunal removed power from the National Assembly, months of protests occurred in 2017, leading Maduro to call for a rewrite of the constitution and resulting in at least 153 deaths. The Constituent Assembly of Venezuela was elected into office 30 July 2017, with the majority of its elected members being pro-Maduro. On 20 May 2018, Maduro was reelected into the presidency in what the Atlantic Council and Financial Times described as a show election which had the lowest voter turnout in Venezuela's modern history.”
