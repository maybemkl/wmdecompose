"Even if the Cubs genuinely thought that Bryant wasn't ready, he was. It's not like the Cubs are being asked to compensate someone who was below replacement level.

What's the worst case scenario for a team here? If they don't call someone up when they obviously should, and when he comes up he plays well, so the team compensates him. What's wrong with that?

If they don't call someone up when they obviously should and when they eventually do, he plays poorly, the team will win their case.",baseball

One of the reasons I moved to Phoenix...  2 downtown stadiums (Dbacks/Suns) I can take the light rail there on a whim (It's $4 for an all day pass) and it takes like 45 minutes to get there while I'm screwing around on my phone...  (Or a 20 minute Uber for $20),baseball
"What does that have to do with anything? Hindsight is obviously 20/20. You have no idea how Verlander is going to do. But if we pitch Urquidy here (who is a rookie) and he gets shelled then we only have 1 shot in Game 5. This was pitching our two best guys back to back and saying the Rays have to beat both of them to advance. Obviously Verlander didn't work out, but the thinking was sound. Quit pretending it wasn't.",baseball
I can see that. CLE/CHI had the historical impact of what would happen if one of them won it and have two very die hard fanbases. Houston also had the emotional impact and almost the whole country rooting for them because of Hurricane Harvey. I just can’t see how the Dodgers/Red Sox didn’t score higher than them and they both have bigger fanbases than us but I do agree with you about the monster that is the New York Yankees.,baseball

Think of a bad habit you can’t break. That’s what ball watching is like. It’s not that Acuna doesn’t hustle or is a showboat. It’s a bad habit many hitters have when you connect on a ball.

"Now that we’re out of the running, I’m actually happy to see Greinke do well... and uhh actually kinda rooting for the Astros in general. A good 30% of the Yankees rings come from the Dodgers so it’s not like there’s any reason to root for them. I want the Astros to destroy whoever comes out of the NL to destroy any hopes I had of us being able to stand toe to toe with them.

"Zack Greinke had a truly bizarre beginning to his career. In 2004 he had a solid 3.97 ERA over 24 starts. But in 2005 he appears to have gone through a sophomore slump for the ages, recording a ghastly 5.80 ERA in 33 starts. The surprise: between '04 and '05 his FIP actually went *down*, from 4.70 to 4.49. So he went from super lucky to rather unlucky, right? Eh. ERA+ went from 120 in '04 to 76 in '05. 

Oh, then he tossed an ERA+ of **222** in 2015, WTF.",baseball

"It usually has to be 2 separate plays though. One error can’t cause another error.  So say their is a bobble error fielding the ball.  Until the ball arrives to the next person who has control there can’t be an error. If next person has it and makes a wild throw, you have 2 errors.",baseball

"This.

From 2017 through the current postseason, the Astros have had all eight ALDS games as day games.  The only reason we didn't have all day games in 2015 is because we Keuchel'd the Yankees in the Wild Card game and the ALDS teams were KC, HOU, TEX, and TOR.

In contrast, the Yankees have had 9 out of 11 ALDS games they've been in since 2017 start in prime time, between 7:00 and 8:15 local.  The other two, including today's, started after 5:00 pm.

"Wins are wins. Wins earlier don't count any less than wins later. Winning late just ups the drama. It doesn't give the team any more wins.

If this goes to game 7, all hands will be on deck. So, You'd rather rest him and hope he is ready to start if there's a game 7 (or even game 6), or at least have him available to  pitch in game 7.

"This is probably the most ticked I’ve ever been after a Cardinals game. It’s one thing if we get outplayed, but this was a winnable game that was thrown away by bad decision after bad decision. Letting Waino go through the 8th when he was clearly tired, horrible TOOTBLAN with Bader (what is it with the Cardinals and horrible playoff baserunning decisions?), Martinez coming into a 1-run game after looking shaky all year and giving up 3 in his last outing, Martinez staying to pitch the entire 9th even after its clear he doesn’t have it, walking 0-3 McCann to get to 2-3 Swanson (same boneheaded way that 19-inning Arizona game ended just over a week ago), not having anyone getting ready to take over for a CarMart who was shaky coming into the game. Add on the inconsistent strike zone in the late innings, the lack of offense, and the fact that this was a playoff game and it is easily the most infuriating Cardinal game I’ve ever watched.

/rant",baseball
Plus 2 strike bias is a real thing. Umps love being seen on tv with the strike 3 caught looking move. Especially against the road team. Theres stats that support it and that the older umps are wrong more than the younger ones. Umpires for the playoffs should be determined by how correct you were during the regular season not seniority or whatever it is. (If they already do this then my bad I'm dumb),baseball
"Was he though? This is a serious question. The article I read said he was like 8 feet away from their group in his own group of a few people. Did he stare at her when he said it or something? I’m having trouble understanding this too.

I mean ultimately it doesn’t matter I guess since the statement says they corroborated enough evidence to know it was clearly directed towards her, and if that’s the case good riddance, but I don’t think I’ve read anywhere what they were able to find out about what he did that proved it was intentional and directed towards her.",baseball

"That might be true, I have no idea, but the clown above me was saying that his defense has worse so the Yankees should be more inclined to trade him.

My point is that his defense has been bad in previous years, so if it “took a turn” it would mean he’s good now.",baseball
"There are different framing metrics, some use rulebook zones, other adjust for handedness, others adjust for majority of calls made. Pick your poison.

You need to go with what gives you the best chance to win the first game before you can think about winning the second. It doesn't matter if you technically have a better chance of winning both games if you don't win the first.

This is more like an economic game where you have to find the best pay out when your second move depends on the first.",baseball
"I'd consider season tickets if I lived in Baltimore just to be able to spend the afternoons as such a gorgeous ballpark.

"I think the Fox box would be okay if it didn't insist on showing one spot as the only place the ball was during the pitch.

If it was just the box without the big fat pitch marker, people would actually have to watch the pitch and say ""damn, that pitch was close to the strike zone"" rather than looking up later and saying ""that dot, which Fox helpfully leaves unfilled for me, doesn't look inside that box to me"".",baseball

"I think when the NL starts using the DH, they should compromise and change the DH in the AL. Make it where you can DH for any position at any time in the game, but the DH spot cannot move in the order and any DH player can not go into the field without losing the DH. Conversely, the DH'ed for spot is like a 10th spot in the order that never comes up - so a player in that spot can play any position at any time, including pitcher, but a player in that spot can not bat in that game.",baseball
"The two top right on the strike zone? Good ball calls. The two on the bottom left? Good ball calls. The one on the left? Good ball called. The two on the bottom closer to the right? One I would give a strike, the other a ball. Everything else is bad calls. So I'd revise to 3 bad ball calls on the Nats to 1 bad ball call on the Stros.

On the inverse, a called strike greater than 50% outside of the strike zone should be called bad.

That's the only way it would be fair.

If you did that and showed the results that way, yeah I would have not said anything.

I'm a data analyst btw",baseball
In a vacuum it’s a borderline call that I think is on the line and a strike (assuming the tracking is accurate). Cole having gotten multiple questionable calls on that part of the plate is what makes it much more frustrating (not to mention the ab then resulting in a home run).,baseball
"Also the average baseball fan is rather old. Are you telling me someone who is 56 who maybe AT BEST played baseball 30 years before in college is gonna sit there with no glove and react just as fast as someone playing right now WITH a glove? Oh and the ball is going faster than ever before, seats are closer than they ever have been, and there is alcohol involved.",baseball

I didn’t want to small talk. He was carrying all his bags. I decided to catch the door for him, I couldn’t be an asshole. It was Buck, friendly as hell, wished me a good workout, I told him I enjoyed his call of the Royals winning the World Series. Small talked about the Chiefs and Mahomes.",baseball
"So a team is trying to do everything they can to finance a new park all on their own and even paying their County on top of that. Most cities would kill for a team like that, but Oakland thinks it's perfectly reasonable to sue them. Fuck them, they deserve to lose the team if they don't cut it out.",baseball
"For the record, a big part of that is due to the multi-use park, made for multiple sports.  They are also one of only 3 teams with bullpens on the field still.

"I have heard the organization say that yes, but given his defense out there, it would be pretty silly to do so. Plenty of promises are made about who will be where at the end of one season that aren't true when Spring Training rolls around.

Also, committing to Davis playing LF doesn't make Nimmo a CF, he's still not good out there, merely passable. It can still be true that the org has said Davis will play LF, and that their best defense precludes that.",baseball
"This is amazing baseball. 

I know some people will never get on board with the celebrations, but when drilling a batter for showboating isn’t an option because you’re trying to win the WS this is what we get.

"Diving plays are intended to give the fielder a more advantageous angle. The lower you are, the more time the ball is in the air before reaching your glove.

In regards to 1b, I'm curious to see what studies you believe have proven it. Statcast did a study which proved that an expert at diving/sliding into the bag (in this case Gardner) is only slightly slower when diving. That is, the best in the game at it is provably slower, just not by as much as people think. For those who aren't named Gardner, they will be significantly slower.

"He has certainly made some questionable decisions. I think he stuck with wainwright too long in both of his starts. He is unwilling to move the lineup around or try someone else which has also been frustrating. But I mean, the hits aren't happening. I just wish he would show a willingness to try and make something happen. You can't use the same lineup every day, batting Dex leadoff despite being pretty much awful. If you need offense you cant leave Jomart on the bench who is putting up the best atbats on the team. You have to sit Fowler, and put Bader in CF to make up for Jomart defense.",baseball
"The balls being used right now have drastically higher seams than the 17 postseason and 18/19 regular season balls. Somewhat closer to the ""normal"" seams you'd get on most baseballs. Higher seams mean quicker loss of velocities on both pitches and hits, and more Magnus effect for breaking ball pitchers. Since the stats were for drag on batted balls, I'd have to assume Arthur is going to look at Statcast data to see if pitchers breaking balls are also anomalous.",baseball
"No arguement from me. That's why I wouldn't call him a badass or an epic player. I think he's great, but lacks the next level. I don't think he's a Verlander or a(god forgive me) Bumgarner.

I would be willing to bet that Toronto and New York are going to be the two main powerhouses if the AL East. Toronto will pick up some pitching and their young stars will only improve.

2018: Yankees vs Astros/Rays 

If the Rays win tomorrow, every AL East team will have made the ALCS this decade. No other division has had more than three teams make the championship series this decade.",baseball
"you're not factoring in that the Nats have the worst pen in MLB history so being down 3 right now with Stras still in will soon turn into 5 or 6 to zip

so the Nats need to score at least 6 runs over their next 15 outs, not happening in a pitchers park dude",baseball

"I literally quoted your whole comment I replied to bro and it is exactly what I described in my comment. Here I can do it again to remind you.

&gt;The video got him cut. Without that video and the brutality of it, hes still on the chiefs.

Also even in your own comment you quote saying ""the chiefs said"" which makes it seem like you are saying it isn't true considering you went on to argue that it was because of the brutality of the video and were making that distinction against someone who said it was over lying I still stand by it and am not sure what your point is...


 So...

&gt;please GFY

no I don't think i will",baseball
"Little bit of both. Our offense is terrible, but every time we make good contact it goes right to a fielder, and every time they make even weak contact it goes to a spot where no one is at. 

That said, they won't have nearly as much margin for error against you or the astros",baseball
"Honestly, I'd say the Ump is doing alright considering he doesn't have the advantage of having a floating, translucent strike zone above the plate with a dot marking the location of the ball as it crosses the plate.    

Don't be ridiculous, people. It's easy to be an umpire from a couch.",baseball
"Look where the umpire sets up. If he's over the catcher's left shoulder with a right-handed batter, he might see a pitch off the outside part of the plate as catching the edge. If he's over the catcher's right shoulder he might see an inside pitch catch the plate. Set up right behind the catcher and you screw with the bottom of the strike zone because of foreshortening.",baseball

But we’ll never know because no one can read his mind.",baseball

The whole cancer research is a mafia scheme at this point. Doctors, hospitals now in on the scam. They don’t want to find a cure they want the money to pay operating bills and salaries.

"The whole team imploded around the Phillies.

1.	Robertson doesn’t play a single game this season
2.	McCutchen’s leg exploded in May
3.	Arrieta regressed bad and dealt with injury
4.	Seranthony regressed badly and went under the knife
5.	the bullpen ate a bag of dicks. The only semi-consistent arm is Hector Neris.
6.	Trade acquisition Jay Bruce batting sub-.100 in the second half of the season and struggling to stay healthy the whole season
7.	Odubel Herrera decided to be a fucking idiot
8.	The entire starting rotation took a step back
9.	Trade acquisition Jason Vargas only contributes to the starting pitching woes
10. Regression from Rhys Hoskins and Jean Segura
11. The ghost that is Maikel Franco


Harper, for his part, did quite well.

The only pitcher they got lucky on was Drew Smyly, who was Peterman levels of bad in Texas earlier that season. As for hitters, Kingery emerged, while Realmuto did his thing, and Adam Haseley, who was called up amongst the rash of outfield injuries in May, held his own despite being drafted just last season.",baseball
"To Morris' credit, he did go 21-6 for the Blue Jay in 1992, playoff struggles notwithstanding. He was the kind of Hall of Famer who benefited from being a very good pitcher on very good teams. Is that enough? I would say no, but I can see the arguments.

As for the other players;

Dave Stieb wasn't recognized for his ability. He was an excellent  pitcher who on one of the better teams of the 1980s. You place him on the Yankees or Kansas City of that era, and he's in the Hall of Fame. The problem back then is nobody saw Stieb pitch - it wasn't like Toronto was on television that much in U.S. markets. 

In his first seven years in he league, he stated 220 games and threw 84 complete games. He posted a 3.17 ERA during this stretch, a 135+ ERA, 40.0 WAR and recorded a 95-80 record.. He wasn't as productive in general after age 27, but that's probably has more to do with the number of innings he recorded. Still a great pitcher who finished wtih 56.5 WAR. Does he get in?  I don't know. He's in the same general zone as many other very good pitchers who probably won't obtain induction into the Hall.  Those include Mark Buehrle,  Chuck Finley, Brett Saberhagena and Frank Tanana. 

Orel Hershiser. Great early peak users and the mainstay on a very good Dodgers rotation. He's an interesting case - there are definitely better candidates out there who are not in the Hall of Fame, but he was part of the last Dodgers championship run. 

His career is similar to many pitchers who have early success and then are solid, if unspectacular, for the better part of decade. Orel's issue was he didn't really pitch in the majors full time until he was 25 . He was dominant early and began to decline after leading the league in innings pitched for three straight seasons, beginning at age 28. He is unlikely to obtain enshrinement.

Kevin Brown will not like every get intot the hall because he's mentioned in the  Mitchell Report. He was  one of the dominant and most consistent pitchers of his era. Between age 27 and 36, he racked up 145 wins against just 86 losses, posting a 3.00 ERA during a hitter-friendly era.  He was probably the best pitcher to be excluded from HoF consideration because of  alleged PED Involvement. Otherwise, he'd be a shoo-in.",baseball
Ehh overrated feels like the wrong word since overrating deals with people’s assessment of the team whereas making it it the NLCS is just the result of play and has nothing to do with how people rate a team. We just outperformed our mean to beat a struggling Braves offense and then had the luck peak that was the first inning of game 5. No one ever rated us as some amazing team. But your point is understood.,baseball
"Ya it looks to me to be obvious that he's tweaking pretty hard/ focused out of his mind 

Rarely anyone knows athletes can take many banned substances as long as there is deemed a medical need. Proving the medical need would be easy for someone like him who has had his condition for life, vs a 23 year old MLB player trying to get diagnosed all the sudden for ADHD then trying to argue it in front of a panel of experts. No one really knows that players are on these drugs, players and teams and MLB don't have to tell.",baseball
"I agree with all of that except the last part just a tiny bit.  It's up to the owners to doll out the payroll, but isn't the payroll based largely off of the franchises ability to make money?  It seems ridiculous to me to think that owners (most of them at least) skimp on their teams when they know full well that a better team wins more and therefore brings in more money.  

The Reds owners have vowed to increase the payroll this past year and this coming year.  As a fan I'm thrilled even though it came to almost nothing this year.  Attendance was largely unchanged, and I can't imagine revenue shot up this year, but the owners are trying.  In this context it does seem that the owners are really emptying their coffers in an effort to give a highly dissatisfied and near angry fanbase a halfway decent team.  

I wish we were the Yankees, but we aren't.  We don't worry about the team moving or anything like that, but we can't help but feel resentment when bigger franchises contend nearly every single year.  That's just the small market fan point of view.  It's probably mostly ignorant, but I've come to hate the Yankees less and less and realize that they really are more than just a fat wallet.  

*The Cardinals are the exception to all of this.  How does St. Louis of all places produce a team like that.*",baseball

"I hope so to come back home to San Diego (if we can’t get Cole).

I have to think he could get $25M AAV over 4 years, but he’s guaranteed that much in WAS and is on a presumable contender (except their farm is so bad who knows for how long).

I think most likely the restructure his remaining years to be 6 years for $25M AAV and he doesn’t test the market elsewhere. At least one year longer he’s earned it so far.",baseball
"I agree, ball 4 on Zimmerman was probably a ball. Even if it was a strike it was so close that it wouldn’t necessitate a make up, I’m also pretty sure make up calls are a myth, umpires probably don’t actually do that.

The umpire just made a terrible call, nothing more to it.",baseball
"If you are repeating OP and you think that Nats fans are actually saying that one call is why they are losing, you are making a straw man argument. But apparently you are one for logic.

No one is saying that is why they are losing. But obviously had an effect on the game and could contribute.",baseball
"Nobody is saying that at all. But the fact we would have lost the games anyways doesn’t excuse the persistently horrendous behavior of umpires, both in this World Series and in general. The fact that you’re willing to shill for umps blows my mind. How can you profess to be a fan of baseball and support people who do not enforce the rules of the game?

Umpires get **20% of calls wrong** and that number increases to **30% when there’s a full count**

Furthermore, umpires **get worse with experience**. The top 10 performing umps averaged 2.7 years of experience. The bottom 10 averaged 20.6 years of experience.

"You're engaging in some serious revisionist history in this thread. Lidge's performance kind of collapsed in the second half of 2006 as the pressure to make the postseason again rose, which season stats don't reflect. And he was only briefly retained as the closer in 2007 before being demoted from the role. His paycheck had increased after his stellar 2005 season, which made his unreliability as a closer draw even more criticism as he was replaced by several cheaper arms who vied for the role. 

Once he got traded to the Phillies, he looked like a new pitcher and dealt with the stress of closing much better without all the baggage from his postseason struggles in Houston following him around.",baseball
"I'm decent friends with a well known beat writer who is close with Mookie who has told me that this idea that Mookie will go anywhere that will pay him a nickel more is wrong. He absolutely prefers to stay in Boston if the offer is in market.

It's not a 'sign at any cost' thing, but both sides expect it to get done.",baseball
"lol not until they were asked if they would make a retraction. Stop defending assholes with too much money and power. 

Saying ""No, we don't do that. We want to move on"" is actually saying they don't want to talk about it anymore because the more people know it happened, the worse for them.

That's also how these things don't get dealt with. We stop talking about it so no one finds out why it happened and how we can stop it. 

Constant dialogue about these things is how you create a culture where this is inexcusable. 

Just ""moving on"" and refusing to address it anymore is how it goes unnoticed/ignored.",baseball
Well really it's the Astros who fucked themselves into having to firing him.  If they'd actually sincerely apologized and maybe let Taubman put a face to the name and also apologize it would've been forgotten pretty quickly.

"Yeah I did not agree with that post at all. And then OP said get back in the corner where you belong at the end which was kind of a shitty jab. And they don't realize this year was a lot of prospects first years in the bigs and Luis Robert and Madrigal aren't even up yet. Not to mention we can still make some big free agent signings. We aren't in our window yet and could compete for a wild card next year, but 2021 this team is dangerous. We don't even need Machado to get there. Bad write up.",baseball
"They actually do. I'm gonna copy/paste a previous reply of mine, you'll see that with overhand pitching, the result of a foul strike changed:

That's correct. Right up through the 1882 season foul tips and foul balls caught on the fly OR the bound (one hop) were outs. In the winter of 1882 it was decided that pitches could be thrown from above the waist instead of tossed from below. With the change in delivery and obvious speed up of the ball, foul bounds were eliminated. In the winter of 1894 it was decided that foul tips caught by the catcher were no longer outs and instead became classified as strikes. It wasn't until after the turn of the century that foul balls became strikes, with the american league adopting first in 1903, though foul bunts had been strikes since the spring of 1894.",baseball
"What's idiotic is the lane as marked requires a runner to deviate his path. The only time that sort of ruling applies is when running from home to 1st. In every other case the runner is granted his natural path from his starting point to the bag, and if the throw hits him he's still safe.

In short, it's a stupid rule and it needs changed.",baseball
"(11)  In running the last half of the distance from home base to first base, while the ball is being fielded to first base, he runs outside (to the right of ) the three-foot line, or inside (to the left of ) the foul line, and in the umpire’s judgment in so doing interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first base, in which case the ball is dead; except that he may run outside (to the right of ) the three-foot line or inside (to the left of ) the foul line to avoid a fielder attempting to field a batted ball;

Basically he was too far inside and adjusted himself to the outside too late and interfered with the fielder.",baseball

"No. I haven't come around. The wild card game is a coin flip.  It does little to tell us which is the better team. But beyond that, my objection to the wildcard is the lack of any disadvantage in confers. Once you win the wild card, you are basically on the same footing as everyone else. That said, it's not going away. My only hope is they resist the urge to further expand the playoffs.",baseball
"Right, what factored that difference of 3% though. Some made up ""park adjustment"" metric? Or the actual production of the player. It's the same issue with using just WAR to determine a players value to your team or your lineup. It's a single metric that uses an average base and goes up from there, yet there is no actual set numbers for that base player to achieve. WAR also factors defense into the rating and judging that can be highly subjective. For example, is a fielder who commits more errors making plays another fielder just cannot make, a worse defender than one who cannot make those plays, but, does commit less errors due to not being able to cover as much ground and attempt to make those plays to begin with. How do you judge or ""rate"" that? You cant. You cannot put a specific number on things like that.",baseball
"Jesus fucking christ.
This has become such a trainwreck that Jomboy needs to do a breakdown of all their tone-deaf media statements at this point.

Instead, they tried to smear the reporter and when that didn't work they fired the guy to save face.

FML seriously I hate everything.,baseball

Bounced off the wall, he would’ve had a triple if he was running but he watched it and crow hopped and shit.

Any chance you guys are cool if the Yankees take him and maybe have the type of starting rotation that lets say can get them to WS for the next few years? Also any batters you dont need that wont dissapear when the playoffs get tough would also be welcomed. Commenting for a friend,baseball
"Have you watched the games? Both teams have played around the same, its been pretty equal other than the first game. The Yankees could've easily won the last two games, they just didn't hit when they needed to. Cole allowed 4 hits 5 walks, Verlander allowed 5 hits 2 walks. Paxton allowed 4 hits 2 walks, Severino allowed 5 hits 3 walks. Really isn't a difference between the starting pitchers the last two games.

The difference in the last two games is situational hitting.",baseball
"That's a good one but at least the Barroid version put up a postseason for the ages in the year they went to the WS.

Kershaw is more than a decade in, on a team in the playoffs for 7 years in a row, with most of it as the best pitcher on Earth, and is yet to have a single distinguished run of dominance in the postseason. Its baffling",baseball
"Hadn’t heard about that. I’m not gonna lie and say I was close friends with him, but we ran in the same circles in high school and he partied with a few of my friends the year he spent flunking out of Mizzou after quitting baseball, so I was definitely one of his biggest fans when he was here.",baseball

"True, but with all that time off, people assumed their bats might be cold and the pitching would be a wash; so our home field advantage plus coming off a strong finish with a walkoff home run to finish the series, the Astros would have the early momentum with Cole and rejuvenated offense.

"&gt; I think you're missing the fact that Kershaw routinely pitches on short rest in the postseason 

Dude, he generally pitches fine on short rest.  (There was an amusing stat pointing that out after the NLDS ended).  And his relief appearances, while collectively bad, aren't so bad they tip the scales one way or another, considering they add up to less than a tenth of his postseason innings.

On top of that, pitching on short rest and in relief is often expected of big-name pitchers.  I can't think of any of them that screwed the pooch in the postseason as consistently as Kershaw does.

Is he a godawful pitcher in the postseason?  Not at all.  But he's supposed to be one of the best pitchers in baseball history, not a 3/4 starter.",baseball
"such a devastating game to watch. Rays pitching and defense was fantastic, but at the same time the astros' offense was embarassing and luck was against us all night.

"You've got to love Strasburg's story. He comes to a budding team, is drafted as a prodigy, and is almost immediately forced into the face-of-the-franchise role. He pitches well before needing early-career Tommy John surgery. After many years of disappointment from the Nats, they make it to the World Series. They're down 3-2 after losing three straight at home, and what does he do? He **goes to Houston and dominates Justin fucking Verlander** to keep the series alive.

"&gt;	(11) In running the last half of the distance from home base to first base, while the ball is being fielded to first base, he runs outside (to the right of) the three-foot line, or inside (to the left of) the foul line, and in the umpire's judgment in so doing interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first base, in which case the ball is dead; except that he may run outside (to the right of) the three-foot line or inside (to the left of) the foul line to avoid a fielder attempting to field a batted ball;

&gt;Rule 5.09(a)(11) Comment: The lines marking the three-foot lane are a part of that lane and a batter-runner is required to have both feet within the three-foot lane or on the lines marking the lane. The batter-runner is permitted to exit the three-foot lane by means of a step, stride, reach or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base for the sole purpose of touching first base.

The three foot lane in this rule is specifically the three foot running lane to the foul side of the first base line. Specifically the section where it says “inside the foul line” which Turner was the entire way down.

Edit: also the rule says he’s “permitted to exit” by means of a step or stride. He was never in the lane so he doesn’t get that “exit permission.”

The rule is goofy, and likely could use some clarification because the lane being foul and the base being fair sucks, but it was correctly applied in this case.",baseball
Really though how would the batter possibly know what he’s throwing if he’s tipping change up then he throws a fastball off that and then next pitch tips change and throws a curve off it. No way to possibly guess what he’s gonna throw if you go into it already thinking certain things mean he’s gonna throw certain pitches.,baseball
"He’s talking about how a judgement call can’t be reviewed. Is he really trying to say that you can’t see a play a second time and find that your judgement has changed. Watching live you could think “oh okay he interfered.” But watching again at slower motion, *clearly* Turner didn’t interfere. 

What just happened is an ump made a call that was bad and despite evidence that it was a bad call, the rule states that an ump’s judgement is better than the video review. Horrible. Horrible rule. Horrible call. Thankfully it didn’t matter.",baseball

"Wouldn't it be better if we selectively weighted the innings for no real reason?  

The Nats scored in innings 2/3/5. The Astros scored in 1/7/8.  

Imo we should give more weight to the later innings, so the runners that score in those innings don't feel like they're worth less than the runners who just happen to score in ""bigger numbers"".

Everyone wants to work it out like it’s some sort of math equation, sure that stuff matters but you’re only guaranteed 1 game and that game is the only thing that matters. The Yankees aren’t really in the position to think about game 7 when they’re not guaranteed to play it. I think that’s the reason why the downvotes came.",baseball

"Theoretically, yes they could (although I think then the team would be allowed to not pay them). 

But baseball is a sport where playing consistency matters a lot (getting into the rhythm). The player would be doing themselves a disservice by doing an NFL type holdout, because if the team says no, the player is (1) decreasing how good his season stats will end up being, (2) give themselves a big lag time after the lockout when they have to get used to seeing MLB pitching again, (3) there's plenty of replacements that the team can use. No MLB player has enough of an impact on their team that a team would be forced to pay them more soon (the player would have to be insanely better than their next replacement and be holding out for like half the season to have a statistically significant difference in their team's performance)",baseball

The umpire shall then call “Time” and impose such penalties, if any, as in his judgment will nullify the act of obstruction.”

Generally, with type B, what matters is if the obstruction changed the result of the play. So, if your buddy barely got beat by the throw to first, I’d rule him safe at first due to obstruction. If he wouldn’t have made it back regardless, I’d call him out.",baseball

"It's probably more painful to get close and not win then to not be close in the first place. You should know this from 2016. It's all about expectations, if a team doesn't make expectations it sucks, doesn't matter how high or low the expectations are. Do I know how it feels to root for a small market team? Yeah I do. I'm a Jazz fan. I'm a Panthers fan. But instead of bitching and blaming big market teams I know the limitations of a small market and I also trust the ownership to make the correct decisions and at least try to win, which I can't say is true for every team. It's hard to be in a small market, a lot of things are against you. But that doesn't mean you can't make smart moves and spend money when you need to. There are teams that legitimately don't feel like they want to try unless shit falls right into their lap. And then they usually squander those chances anyway through incompetent management that wants money more than it wants to win and is okay with floating a mediocre team instead of contending. 

Maybe if a team is always bad and people never want to play for them and your prospects don't want to stay you should look beyond bitching about the ""big markets"" and question what ownership is doing wrong. Markets are a thing, not every player will want to stay, but every market is big enough to compete and, more than anything else, players are attracted to success. If you have good ownership that builds good teams consistently, people will come. Salt Lake City is one of the smallest markets in the NFL/NBA/MLB yet guess what, they've built a legit championship contender this year and have been under .500 4 times in like 25 years. They are by far the hardest place to attract free agents, the hardest place to keep players in the NBA, but guess what, they are a well run team. Want another example? Fucking Green Bay. By *far* smallest market in the NFL, but guess what. They aren't a bad team. So don't bitch about me not knowing how it feels to be a small market team, I fucking know. What I don't know is how it feels to be with a team where the owners don't give a shit because I wouldn't want to support a team like that. 

Do you think places like Miami and Seattle and Pittsburgh are inherently small markets? No, they aren't. All three have strong franchises in other sports that aren't baseball. What limits them is their ownership, not their market size. Places like Golden State didn't get a fanbase gifted to them. They earned it with a dynasty. Houston isn't a big market, yet they've built a great fucking team. Small market is a weak excuse for people who don't want to find something to blame that isn't their team. Yeah, big markets have a strong advantage. You can be actually awful like the Knicks and the Lakers have been and people will still come. They have it easier. But if you think *why* your team is losing is because of a small market then you're wrong. You should instead maybe ask why teams like the Padres can drop deals for players like Machado but your team can't. You should ask why your team isn't an attractive destination. You should ask why people don't want to stay on your team. Do your owners not pay enough? Do they not build good teams? Are they not a good environment to play in? Sometimes you need to pay the small market tax, but fuck man, pay them. Players aren't going to fucking stay for nothing. You act like players never leave big markets but the Yankees literally had a franchise player leave, Robinson Cano. But at least I can be happy that the Yankees offered him near equivalent money and really tried. That they didn't just trade him because there was no chance. If I was in constant worry about all our franchise players leaving I'd ask ""what is the organization doing wrong that makes it so they don't want to stay"". ""Why aren't we paying them enough to stay"". Not ""man fuck these big market teams"". I don't have to ask that because people want to play for the Yankees. Not just because they're a big market but because they're a good team that has shown that they can and are willing to keep successful cores for their entire career and spend money to win. Gordon Hayward left and boohoo. We tried to keep him and when he didn't stay we still built a team just as good. And now we have people who want to come to play in Utah because they know we're legit. They know we'll trade, spend, and develop to build a contender, not just flounder and blame it being on a small market. 

As for whatever post you read, that's just stupid. One, Cashman doesn't get the money so idk what that person is on. He's the GM, not the owner. Two, it is true that relative to their revenue the Yankees don't spend that much. They've scaled back a good bit from their wheeling and dealing days. Three, honestly why not go over the luxury tax. The MLB has the largest leeway to get an advantage through money. The largest advantage that the Yankees have is money. It's objectively foolish to not use that advantage as much as possible. That one person is probably an idiot, but there are legitimate reasons to believe the Yankees *should* go over the tax. 

Lastly, yeah maybe the Yankees would lose some fans. They're very popular and have a lot of casual fans. But are you forgetting your main complaint? It's New York. It's a large market. A lot of people are just diehards and there's a lot of them because it's a big fucking city. You think New York fans don't know what it's like to root for bad teams? Have you seen the Jets? The Giants? The Knicks? Dolan is quite frankly an idiot yet they're still popular and rooted for. If you think the fanbase would disappear you're delusional. People would be mad, but the Yankees have been New York's one stable success and fans are just as loyal as anywhere else, they'd be fine and the ownership would be trying damn hard to make sure that never happens. Shouldn't you be comparing our fanbase when successful with other teams fanbases when they're successful. Teams that *aren't* usually successful fluctuate a lot more, you think that the Astros had the fans they have now 7 years ago? You can hate a franchise all you want, but respect their success, it doesn't magically come from markets.",baseball

"Note that it's explicitly first time that *both* pitchers have been former CYA winners. There have been other times where a former CYA winner pitched game 7 vs someone who hadn't won one. 14 of the 39 occurred in or before 1956, so only 25 eligible game 7s (and quite a few occurred in the few years after the award was created, so there wasn't a corps of former winners yet. Lots of players won a CYA in the year they made the WS in the first few years of the award, but they weren't ""former winners"" yet). 

I thought it was pretty crazy too, but it makes more sense when you see how many of the legendary game 7s occurred in the 40s-60s where former winners weren't wandering around.

Edit - 1967 featured Bob Gibson vs Jim Lonborg in Game 7. Gibson had previously won it 1964 and both starting pitchers won it in '67 (Gibson NL, Lonborg AL). That's pretty cool.",baseball
"I think rule 6.05 covers it then:


(b)	A third strike is legally caught by the catcher;
Rule 6.05(b) Comment: “Legally caught” means in the catcher’s glove before the ball touches the ground. It is not legal if the ball lodges in his clothing or paraphernalia; or if it touches the umpire and is caught by the catcher on the rebound.
If a foul tip first strikes the catcher’s glove and then goes on through and is caught by both hands against his body or protector, before the ball touches the ground, it is a strike, and if third strike, batter is out. If smothered against his body or protector, it is a catch provided the ball struck the catcher’s glove or hand first.

"I don’t think numbers from 3+ years ago should be considered at all when talking about right now, 3 years is a long time.  If we’re countning 2016 then kershaw is the best pitcher in the game.

Is Verlander not great because he sucked in 2013?  I agree you have to look at past performance somewhat to reduce the effect of an outlier season, but you can only go back so far before the results get weird.  

Some guys have bad rookie years and figure it out soon after.  Is Moncada not great because he had a mediocre rookie season?

You have to look at it with context.  Here the context is that Cole switched teams and the pitching coaches figured something out, strasburg has been consistently good to great whereas Cole hasn’t been, but he’s never been on this level.

Also Cole’s peripherals and stuff have vastly improved since coming to the Astros.  Career numbers don’t matter so much as the last couple seasons

In your scenario if player B does that for another season, and there’s a clear reason behind why they got better (much like Cole) then I’m absolutely taking pitcher B.

"kershaw single handedly lost us the series and that nt even a exaggeration LOL. kelly also choke when it mattered.  ryu and buhler didnt deserve this man. ryu was robbed of a decent start chance to satisfy kershaw ego for him to start game 2 at home while ryu had to start game 3 on the road and was pulled after 5innings 74pitches for a pinch hitter, he didnt even have a chance to play properly. buhler excellent on game 1 and 5 just for chokesaw  to lose it.",baseball
"It’s surprising he hasn’t been linked to more openings. He took over for Ron Washington on a bad Rangers team for a month or so and they ended up doing surprisingly well over that time, and since then he seems not to even had a sniff at a position until now.",baseball
"2019 sure was a weird year for road teams in all sports.

The home teams in the Stanley Cup Final, NBA Championship, and World Series went a combined 3-17. That's a winning percentage of only 15%.

Stanley Cup Finals: The home team won games 1 and 4.

NBA Championship: The home team won game 1.

World Series: The home team won no games.

I can't say for certain, but I'm pretty sure the winning percentage has never been that low.",baseball
"i really dont understand why hes polarizing. hes just overpaid, idk if theres anything about him other than that that should make him polarizing imo. he seems to be a good guy on and off the field (except for that uuhhh one incident)

baseball just needs a good heel so fans can get over bryce cause hes kinda a pretty weak heel lol. soto and bregman seem to really be taking that role tho",baseball
"[Here are a few highlights of some of the worst strike calls from that game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3eK5gCChM) 

It's ludicrous, it's like the plate was 4 feet wide. Way worse than the pitch in the OP, over and over again.

...

EDIT: [Here's a GIF in good quality of the game's final pitch.](https://i.imgur.com/C1EJO6V.gifv) Like, imagine ending a playoff game by calling *that* pitch a strike. If the batter had been a righty it would have hit him.",baseball
"Congrats, Nationals! You played hard, and you earned this. Kinda stings a bit, but I’m happy for you. That long a dry spell, with the amazing outcome of a 100% away-team-victory series, it’s historic the whole way around. Good for you! I legitimately have a smile on my face tonight because you definitely earned this and I’m happy for you, even though you beat my ‘Stros. You had some mad pitches and some crazy hits! Bravo and well-played!",baseball
"While true, the Nats were no ordinary WC team. Best record in baseball after that 19-31 start (neck and neck with the Astros, actually). They just started so slow, but that Nats team was definitely worth more than your everyyear WC team. 

Crazy to think that if they didn't hit Hader they could've been one and done just because of that fact. Now here they are at the top of the world.",baseball
"I wish people would just being willing to have it and not attack people straight out the gate. Tbf though some people deserve the ridicule, but its irrational to think that nearly half the country is some stereotype. I wouldn't do that to the other side.

"From the article:

&gt; The rule normally comes alive when the throw is made by the catcher or the pitcher from the bunt area on the first base side. This is when the batter-runner needs to remain in the RUNNER’s LANE. If the batter-runner is attempting to leg-out an infield hit anywhere else in the infield, chances of a batter-runner interference call are greatly reduced and running out of the LANE is not as critical.",baseball
"A big part of pitching is simply gripping the ball in certain ways. The arm action should (in theory) always remain consistent no matter what pitch you're throwing. Some grips are simpler than others. A changeup grip, for example, might be a little more difficult to form, so the pitcher will spend longer moving the ball around in his glove (otherwise hidden from view). On a fastball, say, he might get it immediately and so there's less movement of the glove going on. Some pitchers who know they have a problem with this (because someone's told them) combat this by always shaking their glove the same way no matter what grip they're making.

I didn't get to watch the game so I'm not sure what Strasburg's tell was yet. Tyler Glasnow had trouble with this in the ALDS, I think he was holding his hands in the set position differently when he was throwing a fastball vs throwing something else. The ~~Yankees~~ Astros identified it and crushed him, because they knew which pitch was coming.

Fixing a tip (or manipulating the batters using the tip) in-game is a hilarious counter-adjustment. Doesn't happen very often.",baseball
"First of all you likened yourself to an NFL official. And then if you don’t see what’s wrong with the first sentence idk what to tell you. And now you resort to name-calling. That’s sad. 

Uh, officials without over-inflated egos like yourself. You are important to the game. But don’t try to flaunt that and make sure everybody hears it. Nobody is there to watch you no matter how important you may be. I tell myself that before every basketball game I ref and every softball game I ump. Just get over yourself.",baseball
"There's literally no confusion to the rule. Turner never got outside the foul line and interfered with the play. He's out. 

*In running the last half of the distance from home base to first base, while the ball is being fielded to first base, he runs outside (to the right of) the three-foot line, or inside (to the left of) the foul line, and in the umpire's judgment in so doing interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first base, in which case the ball is dead; except that he may run outside (to the right of) the three foot line or inside (to the left of) the foul line to avoid a fielder attempting to field a batted ball; Rule 6.05(k) Comment: The lines marking the three-foot lane are a part of that lane and a batter- runner is required to have both feet within the three-foot lane or on the lines marking the lane. The batter-runner is permitted to exit the three-foot lane by means of a step, stride, reach or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base for the sole purpose of touching first base*.",baseball
"I'm 100% with you, but this will never be a popular opinion sadly. It's our biological drive to have children  and people become very defensive whenever confronted about the environment, overpopulation  and having kids. Having a single kid is far worse for the environment than anything I could do. Going vegan isn't even a dent compared to not having a kid. 

To add to your point, I also don't understand exactly how's it an accomplishment? Maybe raising them to be good people, but having sex and producing a spawn doesn't seem that difficult.",baseball
"I never understood the mindset of fans who take pleasure in what sometimes can be real depression that the fans of a losing team might have rather than the glory of the other team winning. It seems like whenever certain teams lose there's a giant group of people who take as much pleasure in seeing the opposing fanbase depressed as much as their own team winning. I see it in every sport and every team has fans who are guilty of it. 

Imagine having to troll r/NYYankees or pretty much anywhere that has a large group of fans after a depressing loss just to rub it in the face of people who were minding their own business trying to grieve after a tough loss. I can promise you that 99% of the people who root for any team are good people with a pure and innocent desire simply for their team to win; so to purposely go out of your way to try to hurt people who already have raw emotions and who may not be in the right state of mind is really a horrible thing to do.  


I've learned to deal with depression and am at a point in my life where attempts to make me feel depressed by people have the opposite intended effect and makes me actually care less what they have to say, but to whoever is out there reading this right now, if you're really depressed or in a dark place right now remember that at the end baseball is only a game and that for people to be happy in this game, other people are going to have to be sad; but know that things will always get better. If you really are hurting right now and feel isolated and have no one to talk to, you can send me a private message and we can talk.",baseball
"I don’t believe that’s how decades work. Time started at zero. So the end of 2020 marks the end of this decade. But nominally, yes. Yanks didn’t win one in the 20-teens.

"Are you saying that the Twins don't deserve to be in the playoffs? Because they do, they're a very good team.

"He is worthless , been worthless . He couldn’t tell kershaw was laboring against cards years ago. Couldn’t tell Jensen was over used. Couldn’t tell pitchers were tipping pitches. Gives bad idea for decades.  Dodgers used to be best pitching team before he came. Starter to bullpen to closing.  It’s been shameful to see this now.  Again why bringing in kershaw or keep him? Bad advise giving. Go to media to Jensen for 8 and 9",baseball
"Kinda wrong on that. Position players cant pitch unless in extra, or in a blowout game, or have a 2 way player designation. Players will be designated a pitcher or position player, and one must qualify to become labeled a 2 way player, then they dont take up a roster spot as a pitcher. That's what I got from this article.",baseball
"Honestly I think he’s probably an ok dude. The problem is the media, how they hype him up. Even when he isn’t pitching all the announcers do is put him on tv and talk about how he is the greatest pitcher of our generation. It’s really annoying to be watching a game where someone like Ryu or Buehler is pitching an amazing game and we get more shots of Kershaw in the dugout. Wtf. 

I think Roberts is blinded by Kershaw. I think the Dodgers are cursed by him. If Kershaw wasn’t an option they would have just gone to the relievers but Roberts thinks the world of Kershaw.",baseball

Yes, because it's fun and the team is good right now a d you have to enjoy that while you can. No, because it reaches a point where it feels like people are just making up reasons to be mad at you and eventually things like this can turn j to ""every Houston fan is bad"" which is stupid.",baseball
"If Cole pitches again, I think he gets it. I'd like to think it doesn't get to that point, but I doubt he is going to have another off night like he did the other day. Unless he gets his first loss since May of course. Then I don't think he'd get that. I don't know who got ALDS MVP, or even if they give one of those, but it probably would have been him (or whoever figured out Glasnow's tip).",baseball
"I mean, if he's opting out then he's doing it for money, so I doubt he limits himself to only two teams. Realistically, I could see teams that fail to sign Cole offer Strasburg a huge contract. I bet Angels would overpay him out of desperation if we can't get Cole.",baseball

It used to signify the most valuable player to a team, traditionally a contender, but now it simply goes to the best player in the league.

If these were the standards when Barry Bonds was around, he would have been the MVP for about 20 consecutive years. Kirk Gibson never would have beaten out Darryl Strawberry in 1988, and Terry Pendleton wouldn’t have won the 1991 MVP award over Bonds.""

"James Paxton has looked poor in the playoffs so far. He struggled against the Twins in Game 1 too but was bailed out cause the Yankees offense was amazing that night. They should have kept Green longer since Otto isn't very good and he immediately allowed a HR in his first pitch.

"Which, once again, doesn't matter. He was out of the lane prior to that within the last 45' of the basepath so he doesn't get protection for the last step regardless of where he places his foot.

"Where in the rulebook does it say an umpire is allowed to call a pitch in the strike zone a ball? Umpires miss calls, sure, but those are mistakes. Nowhere in the rule book gives permission to the umpire to intentionally miss a judgement call if they see fit.

"The point is that the Dodgers were outs away from tying the series, after the Sox had been 1 out away from going up 3-0 (thanks Kinsler). The momentum shift was huge in the Dodgers' favor until that moment - that's why it's the best moment of the series and an odd thing to omit unless you were actively rooting against the Red Sox. Which is fine, I still love the Nats &lt;3",baseball
"Example (if this is true): Will Smith was also feet away from walking off game 5. 

But also: I saw quite a few Nationals/Dodgers outs that I thought were gonna be boomed and they stayed in.

"You're intentionally not getting the fucking point. We don't know how the game would have ended up with the right calls. I'm a Nats fan but I've been calling for robot umps well before the current series.

"Because ""World Series"" is the name of the series. They're not scare quotes, they're quote quotes.

The rolling eyes emoji was at the guy above you, and a sizable number of ""clever"" non-sports-fans who make the argument that Americans are dumb, because of our hubris at calling a championship the ""World Series"" without inviting the rest of the world to play for it. 

Never mind small things like ""is the rest of the world able to compete?"" The argument is that the title is illegitimate because the MLB winner doesn't play the best NPB team, the best KBO team, maybe rope in the best Mexican league too. Sure, those guys are all (or at least mostly) guys who couldn't make it onto an MLB roster, but hey, we're talking 9Gag level thought here.",baseball
"It is way more of a toss up. If anything I'd think the Nationals deserve to be favored.

Cole might be favored against Mad Max, but Strasburg has the edge vs JV considering recent performance and Corbin is a big edge over the choke artist Greinke in games 3 and potentially 7. Especially when you consider that game 4 is a bullpen day for us; if Greinke sucks it hard as he has every outing so far and can't make it beyond 4-5 IP we will be in a really rough spot having to drain the bullpen basically two games in a row. 

The only edge we really *should* have is the Dh / bench, but their bench is arguably better than ours at the plate and Alvarez looks fucking useless. We've seen guys bounce back before, Springer in '17 as an example, but usually that is when guys are hitting the ball hard but getting bad luck; Alvarez just looks *lost*. 

Even the much talked about bullpen is pretty close. Each team has three good arms and no one else you really trust. We would have the edge if Pressley were healthy but hes been off since the surgery, was terrible against Tampa, and while he saved our butts in two big showings against the Yankees he looks to have hurt that leg again tonight.. so who knows.

I still like our chances overall, but its going to take guys getting hot and unfortunately the Nationals have the same kind of power arms that have embarrassed our hitters against Tampa and NY so far.",baseball
"I agree. Cole is lights out, but if it means parting with a handful of our starting position players, I think it would be a mistake. These guys are rock solid on offense and defense and have great chemistry. It makes more sense to swap out a pitcher than lose guys like Springer, Reddick, and Correa IMO. Plus, the Astros stress their pitching analytics and have improved struggling pitchers greatly - why not try to get a project guy for cheaper?",baseball
"Eh, wacko conservatism like this thrives on trapping people in environments where fucked up shit can be normalized through repetition and emotional abuse. It’s *very* common for people to reverse out of it incredibly quickly when they’re put back in a welcoming space which tells them why that stuff is insane.",baseball
Yeah watching this one made me cry. You could see his eyes were red. He held it together for the cameras. He’s so used to coming out and addressing the media after doing this. I just don’t understand. He’s this generations most dominant pitcher but in the post season he’s just... a scrub. I don’t understand and he doesn’t seem to either. It’s so sad.,baseball

Jeter was an AS in 2012, so removing him significantly hurts the team. 2012 also wasn’t his final season. Removing Jeter from that lineup changed a lot, and CC is only a bullpen guy.

You're giving arguments based off feelings even though all the actual data says there is no proof that clutch exists.

There are way too many variables involved in baseball to take 7 games in 1 season as proof that clutch exists. We have thousands of games of data and there is nothing that would indicate clutch exists.",baseball

"The difference is that 1st is treated slightly different than a random pickle elsewhere.  The purpose of the special rule for 1st is because the batter is who puts the ball in a position where the throw may hit him (by batting it shallow). The rule both protects him in giving him a space where he cannot be out due to interference, and still gives the fielding team a clear path to throw the ball in fair territory, even if the ball is put in a spot where the throw has to go near the line. It's not perfect (it may add an extra partial step to a righty's running path, likely not even), but it's a good way to allow both teams a fair chance at a play regardless of what happens on the hit.",baseball
"Torre isn't consistent in his statement at all.  He starts with describing the path, and then goes on to counter himself in the rambling statement he made.  

Also, he's not out because of a basepath violation, as that's not what the running lane is about.  He's out for interference.  Where the running lane comes in is that he's protected from being out if he's in the lane or exiting the lane to step on the bag when the interference occurs.  The out is still due to interference, but the reason he's not protected is due to the lane.

"I suppose we can thank analytics for some of this.  If we anoint WAR - or any other metric - as the arbiter of a player's contribution, teams will attempt to correlate WAR to the value of the contribution in terms of wins and dollars.  
Teams run simulations based upon a player's age, his past performance and look at historic data to predict the probability of future outcomes .  They assign values to those outcomes, not only in terms of team wins but in terms of risk and dollars spent. 

Teams aren't stupid. They are paying the stars a lot of money because those players are finite and their contribution disproportionate compared to the typical player.

The other guys are, as Bill James once said (poorly), ""interchangeable"" in the sense that you can find many more 1.0 starting pitchers than 7.0 WAR shortstops.",baseball
"No, quite the opposite. M’s fans never believe the hype, never set expectations. When we had our meltdown two years ago most of us were not surprised. Only the talking heads on ESPN. After hearing how we’re finally gonna make it for 18 years you learn to tune it out and set a low bar.

It appears Dodgers fans expect to win the WS or the season is a failure, which is kind of goofy because baseball is one of the most unpredictable sports. 

If you’re really trying to say the Dodgers who go the playoffs annually (WS the past two seasons) have a bigger sob story that the M’s than I’m gonna LOL and leave this convo. You’ll get another shot next year when you win the NL west again. The Mariners will finish 5th in the AL west and life will continue. Never get in a sob story match with an M’s fan.

In my experience, older Nats fans are usually peachy. They're just happy to have a team again after losing the Senators or never had a team growing up or just never found a home with the O's. We're finally getting to the point where kids that grew up watching the Nats are having kids of their own and after purging our park of the dreaded Philly bus tours our fanbase feels really cozy.

The most difficult part about being a mariners fan is high highs like having a record breaking start of the season to get hopes up then an abysmally poor finish. Having HOF caliber players like Felix, Cano, and quite a few from the past and not giving them a chance to do something special in the playoffs sucks to put it bluntly.",baseball
"But see, the very fact that you recognize the importance of not throwing things on the field, and the negative impacts it could have, already mean that this message is not meant for you, because you wouldn't throw anything on the field in the first place.

The type of people who throw shit on the field are the exact type of jackasses that can't think that far ahead and absolutely would hate being banned from the stadium",baseball
I agree with you that the pitching has been similar (including bullpens) and the biggest difference is situational hitting (the yanks have had plenty of chances)  but comparing those pitchers without including the IP is completely misleading. Paxton went like 2.1 innings and Sevy didn’t get far past 5 I think and both Houston starters went 6+,baseball
"That seems short sighted. They raise the price someone has to pay Harper sure, but they also raise the price they have to pay Rendon a year later, even if he doesn't end up at the same level as Harper.   
Rendon is a better player than Harper, though his age and lack of profile will mean he probably doesn't get anywhere close to the number Harper ended up with. 

Also, I'm very happy with Bryce Harper.",baseball
"That's what boggles my mind about all this. If the Astros have the information about pitchers tipping pitches, know what to look for, and then see it happening, then it's really on the opposing team for not also looking for it and stopping it when it happens. Looks like Strasburg was the first to recover.",baseball
"I am surprised there isn't video, but what I hate the most is this is a distraction right before the WS. If true the assistant GM needs to be fired for starting a fucking fire storm. 

Truth of the matter is we don't know what happened with Osuna. It does look bad but the facts were never released to the public. I also do believe in second chances, but this was entirely classless. The worst part about it is Osuna wasn't even involved... 

This piece of shit just created a major distraction for him and the team.",baseball
"Yeah, we are all aware that no one was watching or going to the games during the tough stretch. What’s your point? No one wants to go to a game when your team is going through a 100 loss stretch. But it ultimately worked to get them back on track. We also set franchise records for attendance 10 years before that. Fans like you desperately want to downgrade the significance of our recent success that you go to the “bandwagon” argument. But if you pay attention and realize that fans have been supporting the Astros for decades before, you’ll realize what stupid argument that is.",baseball
"Im happy for them all, really truly.

Theres a clip of Anibal hugging Max saying that ""we finally won one"". I think it is on MLBCuts instagram if anyone wants to look. That clip hit me directly in my feels.

I think that the 2014 Tigers rotation are all stand-up guys and I cheered for each one of them when they won their ring. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its sad that window of Tigers go down as one of the best teams to never win. Even the Nats just showed that you can win despite having one of the worst bullpens.

Tigers bullpen was the reason why we never won. But, cant live in the past.

Congrats to the Nats!!! Much love.",baseball
"I've never understood why teams don't keep their starters under wraps until game time. It doesn't do anything but help your opponent prepare for you to let them know who's pitching. If I were managing the Braves, St. Louis wouldn't find out who's pitching until they got the line up card. 

Way more effective than burning a reliever as an opener imo.",baseball
"If these were reporters from NY or some rival organization,.I can now see the motive clearly in why they could be exaggeratting claims. This works in their favor to guilt trip the Astros in not playing Osuna since now he's a clubhouse distraction. The story isn't about the WS now but about drama in the clubhouse.",baseball
"Why would you doubt that? You can’t expend the empathy to realize how uncomfortable Taubman’s actions could make someone? One of the women was stated to be wearing a purple bracelet with a message of DV awareness; she may be a survivor or close to someone who is.  Someone who’s been through this may have PTSD about it; although I don’t want to indicate that this is necessarily the case here.  At any rate, bracelet-journalist seemingly had the Osuna situation on her mind, wearing that to MMP.",baseball
"As a long time Braves fan, let me go ahead and congratulate you on your Game 5 and Series win.  I'm not being pessimistic, I'm just being real.  It's going to happen.  It always happens.

This is the life of an Atlanta Braves fans.  Actually, it's the life of Atlanta/Georgia sports fans in general.  Fortunately, the Braves are the only local team I pull for, so the pain is mitigated.  But even just the second-hand emotion of living here for 25 years...it's fucking insane.  It's a state of chokers.

"Thought for a second that may be Cole’s kryptonite before he got the count back to full. Lost focus for a split second and it broke the unstoppable in him. 

I also feel like Soto’s movements are just gonna be downright scary once he loses his baby face and decides to grow a beard. Like imagine peak Joey Bats, or Eric Thames doing this, I’d be like “shit okay here’s a fastball just stop”.",baseball
"Dear God the official highlights have been unwatchable. First shot, pitchers face. Second shot the swing. Third shot ball in the air out of time synch, but definitely don't show it landing. Fourth shot pitcher's face for God knows why. Fifth shot batter rounding bases. All within fifteen fucking seconds.

Fuck you MLB. I have the attention span long enough to watch a fucking highlight from beginning to end, thank you very much",baseball

The book provides interesting tidbits such as how Teddy never really did like baseball which was surmised as the reason why Teddy didn't finish the race first all those years.",baseball

"He was calling it based off of live action and probably what sold it was Yuli's glove coming off. We can look a slow mo's all day and see something different than the bang bang play he had to make a call on. Now, not being able to be reviewed should change though. 

It's funny we all bitch about umpiring yet, none of us made it past umping little league or high school baseball (or ever actually umped in their lives). With all these slow mo's, different camera angles, strikezone boxes, etc we all think we could do a better job, while the guys on the field can only go off their eyes and have a split second to process a call.

"Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s a much bigger part of their edge than we know.

For every pitch-tipping case we hear about, there are probably many more where no one ever realizes. Maybe there are guys in their division that were tipping all season, and still don’t realize it. If you can be the best in the league at identifying pitchers with tells and keeping it under wraps, that sure is a way to win 100 games.",baseball
"Honestly, pitching. Judge will get paid this offseason as he's arb eligible for the first time. Didi Gregorius will be a free agent after this year and he is expendable with the rising superstardom of Gleyber Torres showing he is ready to be the shortstop of now, as well as Gio Urshela earning a second go-around, DJ LeMahieu hitting lights out and more of a need for a first baseman than a middle infielder although Luke Voit is a good stand in for one. The outfield of Stanton, Hicks and Judge is set as long as all three stay healthy. The bullpen is lights out, as long as Aroldis Chapman hangs around for two more years, otherwise it's just okay.  

The starting pitching has not been there for ages for this team. Of the five starters who pitched 100 innings for the team, one is retiring, one will be suspended for domestic violence and one turned 37 and was awful all season. That is Sabathia, Germán and JA Happ in that order. Both Masahiro Tanaka and James Paxton will be free agents after next year and unless they resign those two, by 2021 they will have Luis Severino and a bunch of fodder or a load of bullpen days for a rotation. They struck out on Patrick Corbin last year and I have a funny feeling that they will not make a run at the increasingly expensive Gerrit Cole. The ship has sailed on Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard to the Yankees simply won't happen, as much as the New York media has tried to make it happen over the last two years and I don't believe Stephen Strasburg opts out in Washington this year. I don't know where else they get another front line starter to compliment Severino. They can load up on a bunch of supplementary guys like Dallas Keuchel, Jake Odorizzi, Julio Teheran and the like. If the Giants don't resign him first, maybe Madison Bumgarner as a mid rotation arm. Something, anything because burning the bullpen out in an effort to just make the World Series is clearly not working.",baseball

No. That dude became a cancer in the clubhouse like 3 years ago.  Espn sucked his dick and it was the Bryce Harper show from there on out. Will he re-sign?  Will he leave?  He’s the best player ever!

"Why is there so much butthurt over this? If you watch Jack's reaction once he hits Acuña, he immediately turns his head away as if to say ""of fuck I hit him"". That at-bat was a grind, and he definitely wanted to get the batter out instead of hitting him. Even when Acuña started running his mouth Jack just stood there and took it. 

As for calling the Cardinals old school, yeah, a lot of the guys are calm, cool, and collected, but I think it's more about their personality than a specific organizational directive to play the game a certain way. I follow the Cardinals closely, and I feel like there's been a shift away from the old school way of playing ever since Shildt took over. Matheny had a hard-on for that kind of baseball, though. Also, calling us boring and old school is pretty hypocritical when Brian McCann has been a general in the no fun brigade for years. Each team has old school guys and kids like Acuña (whom I really like) who just want to have fun. 

Carlos was a dick and I think the Cardinals fan base has made it clear that they're more angry with him than anyone else (partly because he wasted an awesome start by a franchise legend). Yadi can be a dick too, but he's our dick.

Tl;dr: too much butthurt, Jack didn't do it on purpose, we're more fun than you think, Acuña's cool, McCann's boring, Carlos is a dick, and Yadi a legend.

But if you want to hate us, then bring it on.",baseball
"He really only made one bad pitch in his outing, the one Soto hit out. When you pitch to 3 players and only make one mistake you’re going to get away with it more often than not. I don’t see it as Kershaw imploding so much as the Nats 2 best hitters willing their team into extra innings.",baseball
"Yah he is not bad at all. ALCS was terrible because of the weird interactions between AJ and Girardi. At least this booth isn't in each other's chili. It sucks when Joe is pumped over a nats ball going yard but then again we all remember, 'and gurriel. Has. Tied. It!'",baseball
"Lol Cardinals fans will literally ask their pitchers to hit other players in the head who pimp homeruns. Sometimes they don't even need to pimp. When Yelich was on a tear early in the year, sooo many Cards fans wanted Yelich to get hit in the head so he'd stop hitting homers.

When Martinez blew the save against the Braves, people were straight up saying ""I hope you get murdered"". Also everything about Jason Heyward. 

Sure, dodgers fans might be arrogant and whiny, but at least they don't threaten players lives and act all holy and upright up it.

"There are literally tens of millions of dollars riding on the home plate umpire's personal strike zone.

An ump who extends or cuts off the outside corner by an inch or two can have a drastic impact on the game's outcome, which affects which team gets to play more baseball, which affects a whole lot of revenue and future player contracts.

Imagine the frustration of being a pitcher and Joe West's shitty 'old school' non strikezone caused you to blow a key moment in a contract year. Imagine being on that team that has to go home. Imagine being the owner who just lost millions. Imagine being a fan who knows their team lost unfairly.

"Now that we've cried ourselves to sleep and have more level heads that last night, let's look at next season

-We do lose our #1 ace. It sucks but I like our rotation even without him.

I like Urquidy, McCullers is back and I firmly believe he hasn't peaked yet, and Whitley may be ready to get called up next year. We could use Peacock as our 5th starter until then. Just know that one player doesn't make a team, even if that one player did singlehandedly get us to the WS.

-Our bullpen will be weaker next year. We may need to make a couple trades to get that up.

"Also why are you comparing the Astros top 6 to the Yankees top 7? You're literally adding in an extra data point for the Yankees that exclusively skews the data in favor of the Astros. And the 7th you've added is Loaisiga, who threw less than 20 innings out of the bullpen this year.

Also I'm pretty sure your ERA+ numbers for the top 6 vs top 7 are averaged out for each team (instead of weighting it towards innings pitched), which is not how that shit works. Ottavino throwing a full season worth of innings at a 200+ ERA+ should not be weighted the same as Loaisiga's 32 innings (of which only 20 where in the bullpen) of around 100.

"They play 162 games in the regular season. I always thought that should be the real tell of a team's strength.  But it doesn't count nearly as much as it should. I was hoping to see the teams with the best regular season records in the World Series, but that won't happen now.  There could even be 2 wildcard teams in it and if that's the case I won't watch it. This is all arranged to make as much money for Major League Baseball as possible, and at least for me, that detracts greatly from the game.  All teams slump, at least a little.  And if a so-so team gets hot, and a dominant team slumps a little, the entire season is for naught. It shouldn't be that way.  It should be much harder for a wild card team to advance. The regular season should count far more than it does. Being a lifelong Cardinals fan, I'd have rooted for LA had they advanced. I really wanted to watch the teams with the best record (which are actually the best teams) play in the series.

35.1 fWAR at age 26. He’s been basically averaging 4 fWAR since his MVP season and that includes a down year and an injury shortened season. If he can get 4 fWAR/year average until like 32 (6 seasons) which seems very doable that puts him at 59 fWAR before he will really even start a typical aging decline. He’d still basically be forced to play 6 more seasons by the Phillies at that point so he could legit hit 70-75 fWAR which is more than plenty of HoFers. Granted I’m using a very rough estimation and WAR is not an end all be all stat but I think he’s still on a good HoF trajectory.,baseball

"Is it that obscure of a rule if there is literally a chalk line on the field specifically for it? Anyone who played at least through high school knows that rule. We were taught to purposefully hit a guy running inside the line after the 45ft line.

Getting to see it in slow motion, it's easier to see that Turner was pretty much on the base when contact was made. The umpire in real time sees Turner running well inside the baseline the entire way and the first baseman's glove get knocked off as he is trying to catch it.

It's not that hard to explain. If a runner is inside the baseline after the 45ft line, they are subject to being called for interference if there is contact made with a player or the ball. If he is outside the baseline and only makes his last step to the bag in fair territory, he is protected from being called out for interference.

If the interference call isn't made there, I am fine with that too. Again, he was pretty much on the base. He put himself in a position to be called for interference though by running outside the 45ft lane.",baseball

Some people on this sub want Kay to be jailed which is mind blowing. He and those other players need help so that they don’t end up like Skaggs as well. Locking them up is a poor attempt at putting a band aid on a very complex situation. At least, if you care about Skaggs in the slightest, be genuine in your journey for justice. If you would have wanted Skaggs to get help, then don’t be a hypocrite. These guys are grown men, the Angels aren’t running a damn Black market oxy ring.",baseball
"Rockies are the only one I could see taking a *long* time.  Blue Jays are poised to be division/wc contenders in the next few years, and the Rays are already there, so they could potentially be facing the Yanks very soon.  Same goes for the Sox if they make a few upgrades this offseason.",baseball
"I know people will say Chapman doesn't deserve it, but he did get 2 RotM awards in which he gave up absolutely 0 runs.

But no, he didn't deserve it /s I guess the one time a Yankee doesn't get hosed in a reward (Judge in 2017, Andujar in 2018) people still take exception to it.",baseball

"&gt;  He hasn’t won any World Series games and he has been in 4. That’s more than any pitcher currently active in the MLB.

In the context of baseball, 4 starts is absolutely a small sample size.  It isn't even a month's worth of games.

"Okay, slightly less slanted version of events:

Hong Kong is a former British colony that was returned to Chinese (=PRC) control in 1999. For the past twenty years it has been allowed some degree of autonomy in governing its own affairs; this is important because the PRC is an authoritarian state where information is censored and many of the basic freedoms familiar to those of us who live in liberal democracies (free speech, the ability to peaceably protest, etc.) do not exist.

Recently, the governments of Hong Kong and the PRC have tried to push through changes that were seen as encroaching on that autonomy--for example, allowing the mainland government to extradite Hong Kong residents. The people of Hong Kong took exception to this. There have been widespread protests for the last couple months, and incidents of violence between protestors and state police who were brought in to control/quell the protests.

Interestingly, although mainland Chinese can be very defensive of their government's actions in a nationalistic sort of way (see the domestic reaction to protests around the 2008 Olympics), they were largely not this way when it came to the Hong Kong protests--the reaction was more neutral, open to the grievances expressed by the protestors. This, uh, concerned PRC authorities, who are afraid of anything that would diminish their control and the state's legitimacy. They redoubled propaganda efforts, painting the protestors as violent thugs who are part of a (probably funded by foreign governments!) dangerous separatist movement.

Where the NBA comes in is that, well, lots of Chinese people like the NBA, and so you can see why the PRC might be anxious to cut off pro-Hong Kong sentiment expressed by NBA players, executives, etc. The NBA, in turn, is anxious to avoid losing that sweet, sweet Chinese cash, hence the initial reaction to Morey's tweet. It's become a big thing, especially because multiple teams have seemingly sided with the PRC over Hong Kong protestors and over NBA fans who object to their actions. Fans who brought FREE HONG KONG signs to games (or wore t-shirts) have had those signs confiscated; reporters asking players about the situation have been escorted from the premises. 

tl;dr people hate the NBA because they feel it has placed access to the Chinese market over the liberal democratic values of the countries the NBA actually represents. People hate China for all the reasons you usually hate an authoritarian state that silences dissent.",baseball

"Not really. He hurt his back late in the season, delayed several returns, and he's been bad by Max Scherzer standards ever since he did come back (I don't have the splits but it's a noticeable difference). I'm assuming he has a lingering injury and has tried to play through it.",baseball
"“Tigers in 3”, anyone?

Of course the Cardinals would have a shot. The 2019 Detroit Tigers would have a chance to beat the Astros in a best of 7, and they’re about as far apart as you can get in terms of team quality.

Let’s take a look at the odds of such a matchup. Being generous to the Astros (or Yankees), we’ll say they have a 60% chance of winning in any given game against the Cardinals. This probably isn’t true, and it’s more like a 55% chance of winning or so, but we’ll use 60% so this isn’t a source of debate.

It turns out that means the Astros would have about a 71% chance of winning a best of 7 series against the Cardinals. That’s nowhere near a guaranteed series win, like you were saying.

And just for fun, if we give the Astros a 55% chance of winning a given game against the Cards, that means they have about a 61% chance of winning this hypothetical World Series. Still better odds than not, but nowhere near a sure thing.",baseball
I’m pretty sure the heart rate thing is somewhat legit. I’ve definitely heard before that elite athletes can have resting heart rates around 40.

"I am. Bumgarner is in the class of these guys and has raised his game much more when it matters. When I think hall of fame, I think of who I want pitching if my life depended, or who I want batting if my life depended on it.

"Sorry, I typo'd, I meant at bats against the Nats' rotation. Like he's probably seen Stras or Scherzer more than a number of your guys because they're in the AL and would never see them. It was mostly a joke I know that he's of course a weaker hitter overall.",baseball
"ERA is a stat that you want to stay low. It stands for earned run average and is a representation of how many runs a pitcher would give up on average if they pitched 9 innings.

So an ERA of 6.75 means the pitcher would average 6.75 runs given up if they pitched a full game of 9 innings. You want that number to be low. Anything below 2 is godly, below 3 is elite, below 4 is serviceable, and anything above 4 is pretty bad. And that's why a pitcher would have low WAR and a high ERA, they go together.

I will note that there's a lot of dispute in how pitcher's WAR is or should be calculated. It's much more difficult to judge an individual season of WAR for a pitcher. The two main WAR calculations from fangraphs (fWAR) or Baseball Reference (bWAR) use different stats to calculate pitcher's WAR so they can be completely different.

You don't really need to understand all the differences cause I honestly don't really understand *too* much, just that a single season's worth of WAR for a pitcher can be controversial. [Walker Buehler](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/buehlwa01.shtml) for example is generally considered to be a pretty damn good pitcher, but 2.2 WAR is a pretty average rating and most people would agree that that particular calculation sells him short, [Fangraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=19374&amp;position=P) on the other hand gives him 5 WAR for 2019 which is much more in line with how things feel. You won't find as much of a difference between the two main WAR flavors for position players so a lot of the time people don't bother to specify which one it is but for pitchers they often will. Hope that helps.",baseball

"That’s awesome! Reading sports for years can help her learn how a game story is structured. Then she should major in journalism and cover her college’s teams. This will come in handy when applying for jobs upon graduating— she’ll already have a portfolio with her bylines. 

Once I graduated, I paid my dues covering high school sports full-time for two newspapers. It’s grueling, but you learn a lot about writing game stories quickly because the paper has to go to press by like 11, and most games don’t end until around 10 or so.  In between those newspaper jobs, I freelanced for several media outlets, and for one paper I covered an NCAA tourney game in 2011 and it’s still one of the highlights of my career . I also covered spring training for The AP in 2012. Then I went back to newspapers to cover high school sports for a few more years.

I eventually left that job to work for a legal news service (I was jaded from my beat and wanted to try something new). But through networking, I was able to sign a freelance contract to cover MLB games as a fill-in for the beat writers. I’ve been doing that as my side hustle since 2015, and it makes me feel so happy and fulfilled.

If your sister is serious about it, she needs to put in the work. You have to learn how to and get used to working very quickly on deadline. And she must learn how to be a good interviewer. 

There’s probably more advice I can impart, but I’m watching the game now. Feel free to message me — or have your sister message me — and I would be glad to share my experiences with her. I hope you find this useful!

Also - if she’s looking to go into TV, I studied and practiced sports broadcasting during college and can also share advice on going that route.",baseball

I know this isn’t totally relevant but I currently hate the Baltimore Orioles. I got drafted to the Orioles in my MLB the show career. I was excited about the opportunity. I got pushed quickly through the minors debuting at age 20. From there I proceeded to become the second coming of Trout eventually bringing three batting titles and two MVPs to the city of Baltimore. How did the team do? Five fourth place finishes and one second place finish getting bounced out in the wild card game. The front office continually traded away good players for multiple mediocre players and signing washed up veterans. At one point they traded the top two starting pitchers for three first basemen. Then traded one of the first basemen for two 1 star outfielders. Despite the Orioles wasting my all star career the people of Baltimore still pack out Camden Yards and chant MVP for me so I can’t bring myself to demand a trade anywhere else.,baseball
"That’s what I figured. I know little about baseball, but do really good pitchers really have to practice pitching a lot to the point where they can’t work on hitting very much?

"No way. I'm a huge Braves fan and I love Acuña, but I'm so mad at him. In my mind, he started the whole chain of events. If Acuña gets to third with one out, instead of watching his homerun and jogging to first to start the inning, we really could have gotten a run there. Then with an extra run cushion, the bullpen might not have freaked out the way it did. That's a lot more wiggle room. There is just no excuse for lack of hustle, and Snitker needs to chew him out.

"Up until the mid 1990s, some of the minor league teams did have players from multiple major league teams, and those minor league teams were known as co-ops.

"Guys it’s not Braves fans just blaming Freeman. He certainly isn’t without blame though. Did he get the team to the playoffs yes but that doesn’t mean people can’t place some blame at his feet. He had SEVERAL key opportunities that he did nothing with. Here are all of his PAs with a RISP:

G2: Bot 1, 1 out, man on 2nd; ground out

G4: top 7, 1 out, man on 3rd; strike out

"Well your point doesn’t even follow the logic I set up. In the NL, offense and defense are intertwined. Not so much in the AL.

In the NL, every defensive player has an offensive role and vice versa. Forcing a position player to pitch isn’t the same because the position player is already playing a defensive role.",baseball

And even if it wasn’t, it’s a choice that AL managers will NEVER have to make",baseball
"Seriously I am shocked because Ryno got hit in the head in the dugout when he was like a top 5 paid player in the league in the early 1990s. Wrigley put up a little fence on the dugout, but if you had that happen to like Rendon or Arenado or something in 2019, the owners would flip out and build a little gren monster around the perimeter to protect their inveatment.",baseball
"They are the underdogs, and if your default team is also a small market team, you can relate to the struggles they do. Small market teams also make the playoffs less frequently, making it more exciting when they do. It gets old seeing the Yankees and Dodgers in the playoffs almost every year. There's also the feeling that a small market team had to work much harder to get there. They can't afford to shell out mega deals to superstars and glide to the postseason, they have to take years to draft and farm and groom talent.",baseball

"Still, they usually don't take it as seriously as many Jews do. For Jews who observe the Sabbath to at least some degree, that ranges from generally avoiding work (a very casual interpretation); to not using electronics, driving, or cooking (a standard one); to not walking too far, not even asking others to do any work you wouldn't be allowed to, and not touching money (a strict one).",baseball
"Really? I'm looking at the A's and they've got Semien/Chapman/Olson and strong outfielders in Canha/Laureano.

Sure their starting pitching looks questionable but their relievers are pretty filthy.

The Rays look a little weaker on paper but looks like their pitching played a bigger role over their offense.

I haven't watched either team though so I'm sure I'm mistaken somewhere.",baseball
Thank you musicman3030. I think its a pity I didnt get to know much of this game before. Argentinas softball has been doing quite good lately. I think they won the world cup and the panamerican games. I'm 27 and I regret somehow the fact that I never got to play it. There used to even be a pitch/field in my city.,baseball
"Interesting point about the mask, the few umpire cams that I have seen seem to be in use only for as the pitch comes in and a possible hit, on YouTube and such. But with the taking the mask off it wouldn’t be as effective in a close call other than seeing the pitch. In the safety issue you brought up I agree, but with some smaller spy cams and maybe not a Go Pro they could fix that.",baseball
"It's because DJ didn't greatly benefit from Coors. He's a groundball hitter. Coors benefits flyball hitters. A groundball is the same in any park, basically. So things like WAR or stadium adjusted stats hurt him more than his batted ball profile suggested. The Yankees, being a smart team, jumped on him because they saw he would benefit from Yankee Stadium and by not getting fucked by Coors' away fever (which is a real thing; Coors hurts you away as much if not more than it helps you at home).",baseball
"Betting odds get proven wrong all the time. Nationals being better or not is not my point. I’m saying that it was expected for the Cardinals to put up a fight, whether win or lose.

I'm very happy with Girardi. And if he was a bit too old school, I'm hoping he's mellowed. Davey Johnson when he was with the Nats definitely mellowed out.

I'm excited.",baseball
"It's wild to think about the fact that Glasnow probably did this all through high school and college, but those guys are just never going to think about it or have the analytics to figure it out.

"I dont like 99% of the rule changes, but after watching the Rays go to the bullpen 8 times (rough estimate), im ok with this one. 

I think a better rule would be unlimited pitching changes, but only 1 warmup pitch on the field. Dude just threw in the bullpen for half an hour. Why does he need another 8 pitches and a 2 minute commercial break?

I dont mind slow moments in baseball, i just hate commercials. And theyre becoming more and more prevalent. The other night i heard ernie johnson talk about boner pills after a strikeout.",baseball

"G fucking G to the Rays man. If it wasn’t us, I woulda been pulling for y’all after yall treated us well during Harvey and for taking in Uncle Charlie. Was a damn good series. Look forward to some more good matches next year, and to see them knock the Yankees off the throne of the AL East.",baseball
"This isn't true at all. I don't have time to go into depth here, but our bullpen fWAR (obligatory ""WAR isn't the be all end all but is a good summary"") ranked 22 in MLB and was barely ahead of the Nationals.

There's other stats that make us look much more average (and I think an argument could be made that we had a league average bullpen) but in no universe did we have an ""excellent bullpen for most of the year.""",baseball
"He points to the umpire that is opposite of the way the batter is facing. Right handed batter faces first base, so the first base umpire has the best view at the bat and vice versa for a lefty batter. 

And the cached is allowed to ask for help from a base umpire because the home plate umpire is focusing on seeing the pitched ball and isn’t focusing on the bat so it’s impossible for him to see both the location of the ball and wether the batter attempted to swing or not.",baseball
I feel like this thread is overlooking that Chapman wasn’t even pitching like Chapman in the playoffs and the Cubs still won. He actually blew a save in Gm 7 and fortunately the Cubs came back and retook the lead. It’s not like Chapman carried the Cubs through the postseason.,baseball

So this game is taking ages so I went to look up what is the longest game in WS history. Turns out it was last year: The longest World Series game was an 18-inning Game 3 in which the Dodgers beat the Red Sox, 3-2. The game lasted 7 hours and 20 minutes.
This game was longer than the entire 1939 World Series. Fucking hell.",baseball
"Tbs coverage is legitimately bad and makes baseball seem stupid. The announcers have to fill every second with inane bullshit trite sportsisms, the cameras can't hold still and the graphics are overly western/cowboy/patriotic themed. Announcing crew making the game about the Nats' offense struggling rather than the Brewers pitchers keeping them off balance, or the fact that the game is actually very tight and one swing away from shifting the other way. It's a good close game but you'd never guess it.",baseball
"MLB Rulebook, Rule 5.09(a)(11): ""A batter is out when... he runs outside (to the right of) the three-foot line, or inside (to the left of) the foul line, and in the umpire’s judgment in so doing interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first base.""

Rule 5.09(a)(11) Comment: ""... The batter-runner is permitted to exit the three-foot lane by means of a step, stride, reach or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base for the sole purpose of touching first base."" On the letter of the law, Turner is in violation. (He ran outside of the line, and in doing so interfered with the throw.)

The question turns on whether the usual application of the rule is grossly inconsistent with the letter of the rule. But just because Turner is allowed to exit the lane to take that final step doesn't negate his violation of 5.09(a)(11) which interfered with Gurriel's catch.",baseball
"&gt; painting a clear running lane to first

I mean, they already have this? You aren't allowed to run on the infield side of that lane so there's no point painting it on that side. Except for--by the rule, at least--your last stride. Don't know why it's not reviewable, though, so I agree with you there.",baseball
"Hampton was fine. As bad as he was in Colorado, he rebounded in Atlanta... also he was an insane hitter for a pitcher, especially Age 25 onward. *EDIT* Also have to stand up for a Crystal River native. IMO the most beautiful part of Florida.

If flaherty was offended by that tho I just feel like he should be direct and not say some shit like ""antics"" like some fucking boomer, especially when martinez was goin crazy sometimes. for the record tho the series was fun to watch, the blowing kisses, throwing inside, throwing the whole bat into the OF on walk offs, etc was funny and good.",baseball
"Their bullpen is sufficiently shitty that it makes more sense to live or die with Buehler than it does to bring in Baez or someone else traditionally from the bullpen.  Maeda and Urias have pitched well out of the pen at times, Kershaw....who knows.  Jansen is a dumpster fire waiting to happen.",baseball
"Because every time a radio or tv show stops interviewing the athletes the complaint calls come in and the ratings drop.

Too many fans, casual and hardcore (you know who you are, even if  you lie about it), desperately want to feel like they are talking to their heroes.  For example, I’ve got a good friend who is as hardcore as it comes about Pittsburgh sports, and he needs to hear explanations and platitudes from each coach/manager/GM, and he lives for behind the scenes footage of things like Rothlesberger feeding his dog.

Remember how many stupid threads and comments there were about the Red Sox not holding a press conference about firing Dombrowski?  Those are the people that feed this.  All these r/baseball fans that would consider themselves the knowledgeable and elite of the fan bases clamoring for, no *demanding*, 30 minutes of completely useless platitudes and catch phrases.  

The media listens.  They get it.  Then they give it in the most asinine ways possible and hit you over the head with the fact that you now have “access”.

Edit: Grammar, and I removed a redundant and over the top emphasis on *needing* stuff.",baseball
"I disagree he has a ceiling in baseball. In the short term, yes. But eventually this isn’t going to matter. End of the day, he said something shitty. People have done much worse and not have their whole career derailed. He’s only 34. He could be hired in 10 years and still be a reasonably young GM.

If he’s as good at his job as people say, he’ll be a GM somewhere eventually. Sports are such a meritocracy and results-based field, talent won’t stay suppressed for long. Eventually the results outweigh a bad media cycle or two",baseball
"I hold that we would have taken care of business in a 7 game set with the Nats handily. They wouldn’t have been able to manage as aggressively with a 3 game stretch in the middle of the series and Roberts wouldn’t have gotten so cute with Kershaw in game 5... ironically him playing it like a clinching game is what cost us.

Top heavy pitching teams with a weak bullpen need to close 7 game series in 5 games or less, like the 2015 Royals.",baseball
"That ordeal was a low point for us.

The dipshit, coupled with the official response. We should have been on a high going into the WS but there was a cloud.

I don't know what effect it had on the players, but as a fan it most definitely sucked the enthusiasm out of me. A team I loved all of a sudden was hard to root for.

Finally doing what's right was big for me. No clue if anyone in the clubhouse noticed, but I'll take the coincidence if it's only that.",baseball
"For those of you who haven’t seen Max pitch a bit the last couple of years, this was classic Scherzer.  On any given start you shouldn’t be surprised to see him throw 10+ Ks and walk more than 2.  Other than a tendency to give up a dinger or two a game, he’s everything you could possibly want out of a starting pitcher.  He’s about as automatic as you can get.  Having him and Strasburg in your lineup always makes going to the park interesting.",baseball
"I mean, the celts had to fight wars with the romans and ancestors of the English. The Irish were hated for years and the election of JFK, an Irish-catholic, was basically the 60’s version of Obama.

"The Nationals are done for a very long time

Our window has closed. Sad that we wasted the talent that we had the last 7-8 years but that’s how it is.

This season so far is unraveling that Rizzo is an overrated hack and Martinez is a bottom tier manager, both of which I’ve been saying for years.

Anthony Rendon will be gone next year and this team will officially turn in to crap, and the only thing we can hope is if Soto magically returns to rookie form.",baseball

I do like the injection of fresh blood into MLB manager positions though. It felt like it was all old guys for a while, but now we're seeing it catch up as the rest of the game gets younger.",baseball
"That’s not the way the rule is written.  He has to actually impede the throw by running out of the lane in order for there to be interference.  That generally happens when the ball is in front of home plate or on the 1st base line and the fielder has no clear throwing lane.  In this case, the ball was on the 3rd baseline so the fielder had a clear throwing lane.  The batter/runner is allowed to run out of the lane for the last step, so getting hit by the throw at that point is not interference.",baseball
"again, not arguing about holbrook’s call. i was referring to the comments when altuve was running to 1st. he was just as inside as turner was, and comments were flooding in saying “interference lol” and “he’s out anyways he’s not in the basepath”. this was a different situation that the one martinez was ejected over, which i wasn’t talking about in the first place",baseball
"Since none of the bag is in the lane, where is he supposed to run on that final stride? He was hit as his butt was even with the glove on the final stride to first. None of that would change if his entire approach was in the lane. 

Also, since being out of the basepath is only relevant when a play is being made and there's no way for the basepath to not include the final stride to the base, I don't see how he could have been out of the basepath on this play.",baseball
Astros lost this series. Nationals heating up. They are pumped up by all the umps bs. All the momentum on their side with Scherzer possibly on the mound tomorrow it doesn’t look good for my Astros.

What is the RMSE for your fitted model for players under the age of 25? I think that you need to add more predictors to the model to improve your predictions.

&gt; 5.09 (a) (6.05) Retiring the Batter

&gt; A batter is out when:

&gt; (11) In running the last half of the distance from home base to first base, while the ball is being fielded to first base, **he runs outside (to the right of ) the three-foot line, or inside (to the left of ) the foul line,** and in the umpire’s judgment in so doing interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first base, in which case the ball is dead; except that he may run outside (to the right of ) the three-foot line or inside (to the left of ) the foul line to avoid a fielder attempting to field a batted ball;

&gt; Rule 5.09 (a)(11) Comment (Rule 6.05(k) Comment): The lines marking the three-foot lane are a part of that lane and **a batter-runner is required to have both feet within the three-foot lane or on the lines marking the lane.** The batter-runner is permitted to exit the three-foot lane by means of a step, stride, reach or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base for the sole purpose of touching first base.

The rule reads if he runs inside, to the left, of the foul line, and in doing so interferes with the fielder taking the throw, then he is out. 

Turner was running to the left of of the foul line, (he never even got a single foot in the 3-foot lane) and in doing so knocked off the first baseman's glove, interfering with the throw.

"So I have a clarifying question then; the rule clarifies it's a judgement call depending on where the runner is in regards to the foul line the last half of the distance from home base to first base. So if he was inside the line 2 steps beyond ""half way"" then gets outside the foul line the rest of the way, would that be subject to a judgement call if the fielder taking the throw had to move outside of the foul line to catch the ball and the runner ""interfered""?

Edit: downvoted for a clarifying question? I'm a Mariners fan, you think I give a fuck about the outcome of a fantasy game people call the ""World Series""?",baseball
First world series for me and first game 7 too. Couldnt be happier!! I made a promise to myself that whoever won this series would go om to become my team from now onwards. But I'm secretely rooting for the Astros as I saw Greinke pitching the other day and the performance by little big man Altuve. Hope its a big game either way. Greetings from Argentina,baseball

I never really liked baseball, don’t know how much I can love it.m but this last few days or week I have enjoyed watching baseball in a different way than before.

  IDK if I can get totally into baseball but try to follow some teams and nationals seem like a good one to keep an eye on. This Soto kid looks good and IdK like their jerseys in a way. I’m from New York but IDK really can’t love the Yankees cause I love the underdogs like my Nets and Giants. My friend from middle school is a big Mets fan so I might most likely follow them but I kind of just want to enjoy baseball from afar. Summer is usually dead so perfect time to catch some games. It’s just hard o stay focused at times but when the game is 3-2 or 4-1 around the 8th it gets tense and enjoy the atmosphere.

Bad base running bails out bad defense all the fucking time. Run clean and it would have been an error. His base running was trash. He’s kicking up infield dirt. If used to hate people who ran like that because they always step so close to or on my foot. It’s sloppy and dangerous.,baseball

Prepare for plays like this to happen once a day next season.",baseball
"Dude?  There’s a rule about this and it covers throws specifically from where that throw came from. 

The runner must run the last half between HP and 1B within the 3’ runners lane. He can leave the lane within the vicinity of the base in an attempt to step on the base. In this case, he ran in fair territory, outside of the base and because a catchable throw hit him, he is out and all runners return to their bases at the time of pitch. He is not protected on his last steps in this case because he didn’t run legally the whole way before being hit. If he was in the lane and then was hit by the throw where he did get hit, he’d likely be safe and no call would have been made.",baseball
"It could be even worse than that, maybe he was deliberately still showing them the tell and then just throwing the ball out of the zone where it couldn't be hit. Then he'd show them the tell again and throw the ""wrong"" pitch for a strike. That could potentially fuck the Astros up even worse because it would take them longer to figure out he wasn't telegraphing the pitch reliably anymore.",baseball
"Probably because real fans actually like winning and not watching their team rack up 17 strikeouts.

"The pitching wasn't terribly different. Obviously Viola was insane and even if it wasn't prime Blyleven in 87 it was still Blyleven. In 91 Morris was insane, Tapani was solid and Erickson was lights out for his first dozen starts before guys realized they should not swing at the sinker out of the zone. Aggie was better than Reardon, and there were more decent arms in the bp than 87.

The core of the offense was similar, Kirby, T-Rex, Gladden, (an improved) Gagne; Harper's OPs was over 900, compared with Laudner in 87. Knoblauch was way better than HoFLombardozzi, though third was weaker.  I have no idea what holes you think were in the lineup, though Mack sucked in the WS and they tried to get Chili Davis to play outfield in Atlanta, which did not work out so well.

At worst it was a wash, and 91 was probably stronger.",baseball
"The problem I repeatedly attacked in this post is the very park factors you’re referencing. The park factors failed to account for the fact that his batted ball profile meant Coors was affecting him much less than other hitters.
And no, hopefully it didn’t come across as though the Yankees just picked up some undervalued Mike Trout. The approach was both to pick up an average hitter that was seen as below average because of park factors that perhaps unfairly downgraded his performance, but they also helped to improve him.
The reason he’s improved so much this year is what I stated in the post; he was never as bad as he looked, but the Yankees also worked to make him better. The whole point of the post was essentially to point out what I believe is an oversight in the park factors, so to respond with a stat based on park factors (wRC+) is missing the mark some. I don’t think xwOBA is perfect; I do believe that because of DJLM’s tendencies park-adjusted hitting stars undervalued his true talent level, which was around league average instead of the 87 wRC+ he ran in 2018.",baseball
"No way we see him in 7 either. The whole thing with using starters out of the BP for one inning is them doing that on the day they throw a side. For Paxton it would be sat and sun off, side session mon, tues off, then start wed. On a normal 4 day rest schedule.",baseball

Besides Trout and pitchers, how many active players have a better resumé right now?",baseball
"There are times when I at least get. Nats bullpen? Sure,  might as well pick up an inning or two from you starters, since the relievers are so much worse. Astros starting JV? Not ideal, but the other fourth starters have looked shaky, and worse case you get regular rest Cole in Game 5. 

This one straight up doesn’t have an excuse, though. It’s baffling.",baseball
"I don't find it amusing that the Dodgers lost... it can happen to my team tomorrow. I find it amusing the WAY they lost. First their star pitcher comes in relief and pitches horribly. Then in the 10th they loaded the bases, kept the same pitcher in the game, and then the Nationals' LVP of the series hits a grand slam before they even got their first out. It all happened so fast. If it was 4-3 it wouldn't have intrigued me.",baseball
Yankee fans fuckin blow. I’ll be the first to say it as one myself. A lot of them are a bunch of grease ball clowns half reasoning because a lot of them come straight from the slums of the Bronx...but the other half due to the run the team had in the late 90s.

"That’s really kind of you. You should probably get up to speed with basics about the MLB and how the Dodgers are doing recently.

Not sure how much you know about baseball, but there are 30 teams split into two leagues (National league and American league). The Dodgers are in the National league. Teams play 162 games in the regular season and the best 4 teams from each league get to battle it out in the playoffs at the end of the season (ending with the World Series). We are currently at the end of the playoffs for the 2019 season.

For starters, the Dodgers have been very good the past few seasons but haven’t won a World Series. They actually haven’t won a World Series  [since 1988](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Gibson's_1988_World_Series_home_run) , so your friend has seen some really good and really bad times with his team. Recently, the Dodgers won the National League pennant (meaning they represented the National League in the World Series) in 2017 and 2018 but couldn’t win the World Series either year. 

The Dodgers were favorites to go back to the World Series this year again because they did amazing in the regular 162 game season. It all came crumbling down though when the Dodgers lost the National League Division Series against the Nationals earlier this month. Specifically, their best pitcher, Clayton Kershaw (who is headed to the hall of fame one day) basically choked in a very important game and ended the season (https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/ny-clayton-kershaw-dodgers-nationals-loss-nlds-20191010-7deypgondzh4vcpd5na44v467u-story.html). This is almost a recurring theme for Kershaw who has had a phenomenal career overall.

After the Dodgers lost the NLDS, the Nationals advanced to the World Series against the Houston Astros. This series is going on right now, and the Astros are winning the series 3-2 (first to win 4 games wins the World Series). This could be particularly disappointing for your friend because the Dodgers lost the World Series in 2017 against the Astros, and got knocked out of the playoffs this year by the Nationals.

So that should bring you up to speed. I would suggest Googling some of the Dodgers so maybe you could name drop them too (https://dodgers.mlblogs.com/photos-dodgers-five-all-stars-all-play-in-2019-all-star-game-aa3ecdbef7be).

Good luck!",baseball
"&gt;No, he didn't. The running lane is part of the same rule

Yes, he literally did. Go rewatch the interview. 

&gt;And I like how you accuse me of being a shill simply because I know the rule and disagree with you.

And because you source a picture from the umpire handbook and have umpire flair. Totally uncalled for. I'd call out someone with Astros flair quoting the astros season ticket holder handbook as a homer defending the Astros for something shitty just as quickly. 

&gt;You seem to be able to read the rule, but you seem to be ignoring it.

Okay, then go find another play like this one.",baseball

check out this play where puig gets on first from a dribbler. The catcher gave up and didn't throw to first. Had he thrown to 1B, do you think that Puig should have been  out no matter what? Because according to this stupid rule, Puig was out of the runner's lane and therefore any play at first would have been obstruction. So at this point, any catcher who DOESN'T throw to first in this situation is stupid because the runner is basically giving you a free out.",baseball
"It's a rule but that rule was called incorrectly tonight, thus the outrage from everyone.

*throws ball directly at runner

*runner hits the glove of first basemen because first basemen has glove where ball is being thrown directly at runner

*interference is called

*everyone with eyes sees its a bad call

*astros fans think this is the correct call

Salty Astros fan is salty, say no more.",baseball
"So how the hell is the runner supposed to guess that the fielder will make a bad throw. All while running his ass off to get to first base. 

He was running in a clear lane if the fielder throws the ball directly to the first baseman and not feet to his left.",baseball
"Of course it's a tiny percentage of plays.  It has to be a shallow batted ball, that's thrown to 1st, where the runner isn't in his lane, and where the throw or catch was interfered with.  So that happens very rarely, so of course it doesn't happen much.  But it happened today.",baseball
"Except he's well off the line in that one. Trea was still straight down the bag and the throw was awful and he was safe by the time it hit him. Bad judgement call, but it didn't change anything in the end. We all still know who the Umps have their money on.",baseball
"I was at the game, so not sure if this was shown, but two foul balls before this Joc turned on one so much it went behind him and almost out of the stadium—behind the Nats dugout. Been going to games for 30 years and never seen anything like it.",baseball
"You do realize I'm agreeing with you, right? 

That the fact that the Angels sign players like Shohei Ohtani (paying a fee to ""take him"" from his previous team, some might say), and everyone else from other countries with the talent to play in the US' leagues means that you can make a credible argument that the MLB championship deserves the ""World Series"" title (no matter what its origins are), because it's the championship of the world's premier baseball league?",baseball
"I'm genuinely sorry you had to deal with that in your life and thank you for sharing. I can empathize because I've dealt with something similar, but in my humble opinion you can't quantify what makes a person depressed. People can experience depression for many different reasons and I don't think it's truly fair to say that any reason is more justified than any other especially when the end result is the same.",baseball
"That’s understandable. I wasn’t even thinking of the option that you didn’t know that. 

It’s just that I’m not really a know it all about baseball and knew that, but I am a Cubs fan so it makes sense as to why I would know more than a fan of a different team.",baseball
"I really liked seeing the players WAR, OPS, wRC+ etc and also they did a good job working in the stats in a pretty natural way. wRC+ is a great and easy to understand advanced stat IMO, I wish non-statcast broadcasts would use it as a bridge to test the waters a little.",baseball
"While CC managed great, i would have never given hader the 8th and the 9th. Pomeranz has 2 clean innings and even bats?! Why pull him.... give him the 8th. 

Even if hader gets soto out his pitch is high as fuck and he probably flops in the 9th. 

Pulling pomeranz was dumb",baseball
"the idea is couched in the idea that america is the beacon for free speech and freedom of expression.

so the promotion would be that baseball is above corporate interests for the sake of the game (like what america is supposed to symbolize) and will not compromise their principals, like the NBA and other U.S. based companies have done recently.",baseball
"Oh no, you went with the ""little guy"" passive aggressive take. I feel so belittled. 
Man, I feel kinda bad. Its like picking wings off of flies. Y'all got a nice team up there full of a bunch of Rudys that play their hearts out and y'all convinced yourselves that you could compete with the varsity. Its gotta be a huge letdown. Reality can be that way. But don't give up, just like Sanchez hit a home run, even Rudy got a sack on the last play of the game.",baseball
"Not going to lie, I didn't think the season was over or anything drastic,  but I was pretty nervous right up until the Muncy home run. Losing the game would have put the dodgers in a really tight spot, and I'm still nor feeling very relaxed about Scherzer and Strasburg back to back.",baseball
"That’s not what a loss leader is. Loss leaders are charging below cost to attract more consumers. Cable networks don’t use sports deals to attract consumers its a way to justify their costs to their customers I.e. cable providers. The biggest source of revenue at espn is the monthly fee they receive from each cable consumer regardless of whether they watched espn or not. ESPN doesn’t really care all that much whether people are watching nba games it just cares that cable providers think people want to watch nba games so they keep kicking back that fee. 

This is somewhat different for network tv but the networks actually made a bunch of money on their last nfl and nba deals. The value of promotion for other shows on the network really isn’t worth that much. The only kind of sports- network show tie in that can really move ratings is super bowl tie-ins.",baseball
"I like the idea different strike zones on the day. I don’t mind an inch outside or an inch high or an inch low. The problem is consistency. In Washington, the umps have been incredibly inconsistent favoring the Stros. Two inches low was a strike. Next half inning a ball. 

But after watching this series and seeing how vital working a count is against these elite pitchers—- give me robots.",baseball
Seriously. The only thing that's confusing is you can go an entire professional career without ever being hit by a play like this because it so rarely develops and when it does professional athletes usually make a perfectly accurate throw instead of the not completely perfect throw we see on this play.,baseball
Well a still image on the sidebar wouldn’t be so bad. I more meant like a viral tweet of her doing it that might hurt her feelings if she saw it lol poor girl was having SO much fun doing that baby shark and she was INTENSE about it. I just...

It didn't work out.

That doesn't make it the wrong decision.",baseball
"I think the overall logic was to get Harris in because he's been a beast with runners on this postseason. He had 10 straight no run outings, until yesterday, though I'm not sure how many inherited runners scored.

"Mostly referring to faster along the basepaths and stronger throwing arms. Pitchers throw waaaay faster nowadays; if people think pitching has surpassed *today's* batters, then it's gonna be way worse for 2001 batters.

"At least you guys did make it to the World Series, once. And that say your team isn't the Mariners or the Expos/Nats, who have both never made it to a World Series.

And before 2005, I kept worrying the White Sox would never win a WS in my lifetime. Keep up your faith in the Rockies, since usually it seems teams that win the WS are often the teams people least expect to win it all. Another similar example to the White Sox in 2005(where noone saw their upcoming WS win coming), was when the Astros won the WS in 2017.",baseball
"Morton might be in my top 5 favorite Astros ever even with only being here for 2 years. But there's a couple of huge reasons the average fan doesn't know about him. He's 35 and he's only had 3 good years. He's also not super marketable. He's a quiet, shy guy who throws a great curve but doesn't ever show too much excitement on the mound.",baseball
"I was a high school kid in new england and had friends on the A's bandwagon in a good way because that team was pretty fun.  But i also think history wayyyy over credits the A's that year, and they probably weren't even the most interesting storyline of the year.

A few fun things about that season that history seems to distort:

* The offense was a hodge podge but the A's had ""the Big 3"" pitchers who were legitimate stars and were a huuuge reason those teams were good... getting 3 ace-level pitchers on pre-arb salaries is a pretty nice core to build around
* Despite the ""Big 3"" being incredible, they were overshadowed by the D-backs, Red Sox, and Yankees historically great rotations.  Randy Johnson/Curt Schilling were absurd.
* The WS winning Angels lineup was probably more ""moneyball"" than the A's:
   * Their best players were a 5'7 shortstop and an elite defensive OF with a .700 OPS.
   * Tim Salmon was maybe their best hitter that year... with 100 K's, 10% walk rate, only 22 HR's.
   * WS MVP was troy glaus... 144 K's (!), 10% walk rate, ""only"" 30 HRs.
   * Garret Andersen and his 123 RBI's and 3% walk rate might make you think he wasn't a moneyball hitter.  But he ""only"" hit 29 HR's...... the core of his offense was the 56 doubles.
* 2002 included **all time** great seasons from Barry Bonds, Alex Rodriguez, Randy Johnson, and Curt Schilling
   * The d-backs were swept in the NLDS
   * The rangers had a losing record
   * The giants - despite bonds having what may well be the best individual player season in the history of the sport - lost the WS to the angels and their rag tag band of scrappers.",baseball
"this is the one where I thought ""oh wow they're *really* not in a good way tonight."" just looked totally defeated after it, gardner wasn't even there to try to hold altuve to first. to come out after a horror inning and immediately do that, not a good sign. and after all that they panned to didi smiling through his glove talking to someone...

really bizarre because given all those errors and base runners the astros hadn't even done a great job at converting them. given the ump's strike zone, the power in the line up, and it being october, a four run lead did *not* feel safe. who knows though could wake up on the other side of the bed today",baseball
"Oh shit, I only read one headline about the chanting, something like ""Fans chant ""Uber"" when taxi-driver turned MLB pro takes the field"", I actually thought it was meant positive, like paying respect to someone who worked himself out of a low paying job to his dream.

Here’s just a general thought on mlb &amp; it’s future: maybe nobody’s watching the mlb product bc the only games that aren’t on cable are the friggin 4-7 of the World Series . That involves 2 teams. If they wanted to grow the sport they’d stream it free or put it on network tv.,baseball

"And hey-- I dont' know if you saw this comment below and I'm having my post-work nightcap right now, but what I always say is that I hope Mets' fans don't hate me because all I'm saying is that I think they deserve better. Baseball is won at the GM position and with talent acquisition. I really reallly really really don't like an agent becoming a GM. It's 20 Years behind it's time. Teams DO NOT win the World Series because of Free Agent signings. The 2018 WS Champion Boston Red Sox were paying a total of 100+ Million for two roughly average pitchers (Price+Porcello), an international failure (Rusney), and two horrendous contracts that were not on the roster at that time (Hanley+Sandoval). Teams simply don't win or win consistently because of Free Agency. I don't use flair in any sub, but I'm a Cubs fan. Our biggest singing the year we won? Giving a glove first, inconsistent Jason Heyward a big fat overpay. Teams win because of talent acquisition and being able to manipulate the massive six years of team control that baseball gives you. It's goign to be a long time before we find out, but I love where the Balt. Orioles went last year to find their GM. Mike Elias has worked as a Scout under Jeff Luhnow and is a part of the highly prestigious ""Walt Jocketty"" GM tree as I like to call it. Even on paper, where BvW benefits the Mets the most is FA... and teams simply DO NOT win championships in this day and age because of FA acquistions. It has to do with making the most of the 6-year window you can get with elite players without a major contract.",baseball

"Stop with that bullshit. I thought this narrative was dead. The NL is just as good as the AL. The AL just has a bunch of shit tanking teams at the bottom inflating the teams at the tops records. The AL has the Royals, Tigers, Orioles, Blue Jays, Angels, and Mariners who all won under 70 games and Angels and White Sox who only won 72. The Marlins, Pirates, and Rockies were the only truly awful teams in the NL this year with the Reds, Padres, and Giants not being total pushovers. Everyone else was a playoff contender into September. The Braves, Dodgers, Nationals, Mets, Phillies, Cardinals, Brewers, Cubs, and D-Backs probably all would've won more games in the AL.

"Yes we want him to have a better feel for the game and not strictly rely on analytics.  However, pitching postseason Kershaw on short rest out of the bullpen in a critical 8th inning of an elimination game is NOT the “feel” we want a manager to have.

"I was genuinely concerned y’all were going to beat us last year. Could’ve gone either way, we just had a few plays go our way, and that was the main difference. If Benny misses that ball  and y’all end up winning that game it’s an entirely different series.

Edit: not to mention Altuve had to play injured.",baseball
"I see Molina's antics as a way to fire up the team. The Cubs pitch that was up and in that he made a big deal about happened after losing 3 straight (soon to be 4) as the team was looking like they were going to implode and blow the division (which we very likely/possibly would have done if not for the Rockies sweeping the Brewers) and the ""Bryant finds STL boring"" response came at a time when the Cubs were seen as a definitively better team than the Cardinals. Even when he's not in the right all his stuff does is raise the stakes of the situation and on a personal level I like it because it keeps the Cardinals/Cubs rivalry strong which is good for both fanbases. Carlos is being a hypocrite and the 27ERA both appearances doesn't help.",baseball
"Yeah the ideal situation from now on would be for us to have the best record in the AL and for you guys to win the division. So we don’t face off until the ALCS

The most cruel irony would be if Twins were to have the best record in the league, only to face the Wild Card Yankees in the ALDS",baseball
"Plausible scenario: Reporters are being critical of Osuna's performance in a locker room which is celebrating winning the pennant.

THAT BEING SAID, other reporters are backing up the SI story that Taubman intentionally targeted his comments to the female reporters and did so in a possibly demeaning way.",baseball
"Yep, formula is not including the Cardinal’s 2 because of the 6 team format. I trusted and didn’t want to verify.

"I think your scenario could partly be what happened, in combination with Taubman being wasted. He definitely seems like a lightweight with a touch of little-man's syndrome.

Did Taubman just yell that shit out, or did he specifically confront these women?  We don't know, but the author sure frames the story to make it look that way.  

Another bit of context: SI recently went through a massive blood-letting... their staff is a fraction of the size it was just few months ago.

"I think it’s yet to be seen what the Dodgers do (or do not do) with Urias. The Dodgers really couldn’t do much as LA county basically gave him two choices. Be charged with DV or attend a 52-week DV program. He took the latter. Then after months of investigating, MLB served him with his suspension after the trade deadline. So the Dodgers really couldn’t do much after MLB stepped in. If they were to send him down to the minors or DFA him for reasons only to do with DV, that may have lead to some kind of legal battle about double jeopardy or something. I’m only speculating. However, he was on the postseason roster so who knows. My hope is that Urias is traded this winter though. The Dodgers did back out of the Chapman trade, so it’s not like they don’t care about brand image and clubhouse cancers. 

TL;DR. The timing for LAD to handle the Urias thing during the season wasn’t right because MLB dealt with it, but LA could do something this winter.",baseball

"A very good chance. They have one of the best 2 starting tandem in the game. Throw in Sanchez who is good for a solid 5 or 6.

Second, that's a lot of parking lots right now. Like, *extremely crucial* parking for people that don't live immediately downtown to be able to go downtown, especially when we have no real public trans. They have to replace the parking. 

Third, we just had a huge political battle over the soccer stadium building on a dilapidated faiegrounds. If the city is just gonna give them this land or sell it at a premium, there's gonna be a lot of legal battles.

It would be a lot better if they could buy the salvage yard next door to this site and do the whole thing privately. Even then I'm skeptical on how well the team would be supported. We have a lot of Braves fans and transplants and we're just not 4 pro teams big. I would love to have baseball an uber from my house, but I also don't want our city to be embarrassed because we have 9k showing up to games in April.",baseball
"1) The whole transparency thing and not announcing the changes, as you said.

2) The idea that the league has been treating the different balls as being something unintended and beyond their control, yet they clearly have the ability to switch the ball at a time of the league's choosing.

3) The ball can give an advantage to a team because the ball may curve more and travel less far, helping some players more than others.  It's not as bad as if only one team got to hit juiced balls but the change doesn't necessarily affect everyone in the same way.  For example, a team that relies on power hitters may be more disadvantaged than a team that relies on striking out batters. 

4) It seems unfair to have playoff games operate under different conditions than the regular season.",baseball
"~~Ah, I thought this was the rulebook last night, but now I see it's the Minor League Baseball Umpire Manual and it is only an interpretation of the actual rule, 5.09(a)(11). That said, is this not considered legal canon in the minors?~~

Actually, scratch that. This is what the MLB Rulebook, 2015 says right under 5.09(a)(11):

&gt;""Rule 5.09(a )(11) Comment (Rule 6.05(k ) Comment): The lines marking the three-foot lane are a part of that lane and a batter-runner is required to have both feet within the three-foot lane or on the lines marking the lane.""

So according to the rules, it is plainly true that the batter-runner is ""required to have both feet within the three-foot lane or on the lines."" That's as close to saying the batter-runner should be out without actually saying the word ""out.""",baseball

"If the Nats win the WS, are teams going to start and pivot away from bullpen overuse and back to longer starts?

"I think the response over on /r/Astros was really good to Taubman getting fired. I will say there was a few flairless people who came in and bitched about PC culture. Of course going through their post history they never commented on our sub before and not even on here. 

Anyways, on to baseball. Greinke was really great in his last start and it is exciting to see him get a chance to hit. If we win this game, then I’d imagine we will bullpen game four and would use a lot of pinch hitting whenever the pitcher does come up. The only remaining question is if Hinch believes in Yordan enough to drop someone in the lineup to put him in left.",baseball
"Or at least after 10, a shot and the ball. In baseball, the thing the gets me is a reliever warms up in the pen, comes in, and gets to throw another 10 pitches? Jog to the mound, take one warm up, and go. Those breaks are longer than inning breaks!",baseball

"&gt;Id like to think that this individual has access to some legal representation that essentially doesnt let this his career and get him some money for it too.

Why should Taubman get money for this?  Texas is an at-will employment state.  Taubman could likely be fired for no reason at all and, unless contracted for, would not be entitled to severance.  The fact that Taubman was fired for cause means he absolutely shouldn't be entitled to any further compensation.

If a low-level staffer made a comment like this, they'd be fired immediately and that could easily end their career in baseball.  Why should Taubman be entitled to some level of protection/forgiveness that a lower-level employee wouldn't be granted?

&gt;and bigger question of course, is this guys career over?

Probably not, but who cares if it is?",baseball
"It's very hard for me to blame losses on umpires, but it doesn't help that one of our biggest opportunities for offense was snuffed by a blind call. It also doesn't help that the Astros seemed to almost always capitalize off of our missed calls.

Of course, the bats fell silent so that doesn't help",baseball
"Earlier on I was like the Nationals are screwed, Greinke with less than 70 pitches is on his way. He’s in the groove. Insert bullpen guy because you can’t trust your cy young winning starter. Come back later Hendrick destroys the bullpen not likely cy young guy. I thought the astros had this if they stuck with Greinke.",baseball
"This championship was a karma reversal of some real shit luck the Nationals had this decade.

Strasburg needs TJS two months after being called up in 2010. From 2012-2017 they either lose in the NLDS (three game 5 losses at home) or miss the playoffs altogether in spite of having very talented rosters. Their most marketable player leaves after 2018. So I guess this championship makes up for all the heartbreak their fans had to endure this decade.",baseball

Its this dumb belief on the broadcasters part that they should constantly talk. I relish the times when they just shut up and let you enjoy the moment. When I was still living in NY we used to enjoy watching the games on mute while listening to the radio for the play-by-play and commentary. The radio broadcast actually had less useless chatter. Only problem was they didn't really sync up perfectly.,baseball

"&gt;The replay system is why games are taking longer

[Nope, it's time between pitches.](https://www.sbnation.com/a/mlb-2017-season-preview/game-length)

Simply enforcing the pitch clock rule that is already on the books would cut game length significantly.

The thing that pisses me off the most about the ""pace of play"" phrasing is that ALL of Manfred's tinkering doesn't materially affect the pace of play, it affects the overall length of the game and the strategies employed within it.  There's always going to be downtime in baseball.  Hell, all four major pro sports in the US have an average game time of 3 hours, and only hockey features as much actual game action as baseball does.  Football and basketball on a minute by minute basis have less action than baseball.  The difference is that when there is action it involves every player on the field/floor most of the time, and they tend to be clustered closer together so the overall impression to the viewer is one of more excitement.",baseball

"It’ll be touched. The record was 13 prior to this. 

And again, it’s not pathetic to make the playoffs enough to compete for that record. The guy was calling the Twins a pathetic team. I think that’s ludicrous. They’re better than the teams who go 20 years between playoff appearances I’d say. 

I’m *not* saying the Yankees fans should feel worse, I’m saying that was a more pathetic showing. (Plus this record is over almost two decades, the teams involved are totally different. It’s just a flukey stat, not pathetic).",baseball
"The guy you're arguing with claimed that the other teams would have beat the pitching that shut down the Twins.

"I think comments like this just show how sensationalized this story has become. He made a mistake, he *admitted it*, but because he wasn't begging for forgiveness on his knees, he's now selfish, lazy, and Machado-esque? Come on man.

He made a mistake. No doubt about it. But he didn't make it out of laziness or selfishness, he got over-excited and made a mental lapse. No one loves this team more. No one wants to win more. This guy hustles daily, he cheers for his team mates daily, he took one of the more team-friendly deals in league history so he can stay with this team and these team mates.

But sure, I guess he's basically Machado 2.0.",baseball
"They are talking about the previous batter. The ump had been calling strikes just outside all game long. So Cole put it right where previous strikes had been called for both teams and he called a ball. I’m not saying it’s a makeup call or the correct call, just saying that this is what they are referring to with this.",baseball
"It was only a 3 goal lead, and more like 10 minutes left. And yeah, the play warranted a 2 min minor at most and probably would not have even been called had the dude not been injured. It wasn't called initially until the refs saw Pavelski laying there not moving. Pretty egregious. And then the Sharks won Game 7 of the 2nd round thanks to an offsides call that was a true 50/50 call and overturned a tying goal for Colorado late.  Then in Round 3 in OT, the Sharks scored a goal after a missed hand pass in the offensive zone. Play is supposed to stop on hand passes. It directly lead to the goal. Sharks took a 2-1 series lead and everyone thought here we go again. And then the Blues roflstomped them the next 3 games on their way to the Cup. Being a huge Blues fan, I almost swore off hockey after Game 3.",baseball
"No joke, I did this at a game earlier this season. Mets were playing the Nats (same game as the 7 run comeback) and Joe Panik was at bat. Pitcher and catcher had a meeting between the plate and the mound, and I turned to the guy next to me and said, ""home run right here."" Sure enough, next pitch Panik blasts it past the center field wall. Predicting home runs is the coolest thing ever.

Edit: misspelled Panik",baseball
"I honestly love how all the micro managing, rigid, new age “game planners” are losing in the playoffs. You have to have in game intuition to win the World Series. 

Dave Roberts has a managing style that annoys me as well. If a pitcher is good, leave him in. If he’s comfortable and dealing, maybe his third time through the line up will still be easier than a nervous reliever you bring out of the pen. 

You can’t rely on four pitchers to all have their stuff on a high pressure night. It’s asking too much.",baseball
One big reason for the MLBPA - relief pitchers filling these last spots are usually AAA arms making league minimum and being rotated through as they get used. The PA hope is that adding the extra position adds an extra slot to hire a veteran bench bat or keep an experienced utility player around (who'll both be making more than league minimum) rather than just rotate fringe pitchers.,baseball
"I agree with this take. Both ALDS series played out the opposite of what I was expecting. I thought the Astros would roll through the Rays 3-0 and that the Yankees would struggle with the Twins. 

The Yankees got good enough pitching, clutch hits, and the best defense they’ve played all year. But can they do that again? Doubtful. 

Meanwhile, the Astros offense was quieter than normal for most of the series, but the Rays pitching is insane. And they had a rare bad start from JV, which you don’t expect to see again. 

We also didn’t see a 4th starter, or extended reuse of the pens. 

Given that, I feel like anything could happen this series.",baseball
"I have yet to see a video where the runner actively interferes with a throw after not running in the runners lane.

It isn't a let the kids play type of thing. I am all for bat flips and celebrations. But not everything calls for one, and sometimes it just looks out of place. But to actually want to show someone up just because you did your job? Ok dude, that's some self-centered bs right there.",baseball
"I'd agree with that if the bases werent raised so much

People tweak their ankles incredibly often hitting the bag because of how high up it is

You're now asking an incredibly fast guy to make two incredibly quick cuts and hope he doesnt twist his ankle hitting the weird raised platform.

You cant have a runners lane rule with a raised base. Or if you want to keep the raised base part of it needs to be in the runners lane

The runners lane doesnt have any part of the base in it and people are surprised folks take a straight line to the bag",baseball
"It’s not perfect, but it’s much better than fWAR. Greinke and Kershaw played for the same team so they had very similar defense when they pitched. ERA is a very good way to compare the two and the difference is enough to know that Greinke is better. Using FIP is stupid and that proves it. 

deGrom was obviously better than Nola, but in BR’s defense, the Phillies had a historically bad defense which made it hard to adjust.",baseball

"But that’s part of my argument. We all admit that sometimes pitchers get strikes because a catcher frames it well, and sometimes they lose strikes because the catcher bones it up.

"Rule 5.07(a) gives the basics of a legal pitching motion either from the windup or from the stretch.  Rule 6.02(a) covers balks.  They're separate rules in the rulebook, so I guess the answer to your first question is yes.  However, 5.07(a) doesn't go into a lot of detail about pitching motions, so the balk rule basically covers anything that doesn't comply with a legal pitching motion.  

&gt;Like say, could the pitcher hike the ball like a football and still be legal?

Rule 6.02(a)(6) says it's a balk if ""The pitcher delivers the ball to the batter while he is not facing the batter.""

&gt;Bounce the ball as if they were playing cricket?

That's legal, but the definition of a ""ball"" includes this sentence: ""If the pitch touches the ground and bounces through the strike zone it is a 'ball.'""

&gt;Spin around and toss it like a shotput?

That breaks a whole bunch of pitching rules.  A legal pitch includes a foot staying on the rubber and not stepping in a direction other than toward home plate (or toward a base for a pickoff throw).

"You clearly haven’t paid much attention to Ender. He certainly isn’t a great hitter(even his career year offensively when he hit .301 and had 200 hits he has a 98 wRC+) but he is still serviceable. He has been a slow starter and this year he started dreadful then missed like 2 months due to injury. In the games he came back he was MUCH better .293/.411/.520 in 25 games.

This also completely ignores his value defensively and what he adds in terms of depth. A lot of Ender’s value comes from the fact that he is an elite defensive CF. Since joining the Braves in 2016, Ender is 3rd among CF’s in DRS and 4th in UZR/150(an example as well both of which he is WELL ahead of Trout defensively). Putting Ender in CF, Acuña in LF, and Markakis in RF is more ideal than Acuña in CF, Markakis in LF, and Joyce in RF defensively. Also adding Ender moves the aforementioned Joyce to the bench and having a left handed bat like Joyce coming off the bench is much better than having a left handed hitter like Ortega coming off the bench...",baseball
"Here is where I am going to get pilloried and have tomatoes thrown at me in five, four, three, two, one...

Thank you for at least allowing me to stand on my soapbox.  

I like the cover, but I  do think that the game does need to be speeded up.  Baseball has to acknowledge it has competition like ice hockey and MMA and [shudder] soccer.  A lot of the older dudes don't want it to change, but they disregard three things: who is gonna sit in your season ticket seat when you are too old?  How did the NFL take the place of baseball as the number one sport and what do we need to learn from that?  What actually DO younger viewers like to watch and if it is a faster pace with more action, why do so many whine about it rather than accept that they are not going to change and the game might have to?

  I am a little sad to see a guy can get his hot dog  but there is not as much change in play as there should be. ""How much can happen"" is different from everything happening BUT someone trying to hit the ball and somebody throwing it.  Listen to an old radio broadcast of a game from, oh, when Jackie Robinson was a rookie.  It would be two hours long.  The point is,  the game was not always like this. Last  year the World Series (Red Sox v. Dodgers) took hours and hours. It broke the record, I think.  Not good.  Not when a chunk of the US population is now more accustomed to video game Call of Duty speed.

Since the 80s the tv broadcasters have flooded the game with replays and commercials and commentary and  on and on and it has contributed to slllooooooowww doooooowwwn thhhhhhee. gaaaammme [moving in slow-mo.] The players and managers have adjusted the pace of play for tv (I would know-I make motion graphics for a living and in old games actually there was no room for them, no time. Not anymore.) 

The adjusting in gloves, the setting up of  pitches, the ball scratching? That can add on another half hour.  And as for sabermetrics, I am not a total fan.  Some of that might have to be banned at least partially. Why?-sabermetrics is set up to produce wins, but it ignores that the sport is predicated on people watching it.  That is what pays for everything-stadium, players, managers, you name it.   It does not figure in that the audience might *like*  witnessing a player stealing home plate.  It does not figure in that champs of old had to use their wits and make a gamble and hustle a little and guess if x move is wise. (Sabermetrics gives a player a vacation from having to think for himself and a game where winning is everything can actually become less exciting to watch.)  It is like card counting at a blackjack table.  Games get stale when they get too predictable.  

The players and their union have not realized that the pace and lack of evolution in the rules is threatening the game since they are right in it and most have no memory of a faster pace. They also seem to have rules that hinder change: privately I would give anything for catchers to have to take a charge at home plate like the old days. No spiking of course, but basketball players fall on their backs from time to time and most live to be old.  I'd even pay money to see *a left handed catcher* since it is not fair that a whole position is now verboten to a big chunk of the population. (The Babe himself said baseball is supposed to be for everyone.)  Cricket got so stale and caught up in its rules and the albatross of tradition that in time it became the ultimate snob sport for prep school boys in England and because of its setup the game....started to go on...for DAYS....and the people....who would have once loved watching it....got sick of the sanitation and lack of action and class divide....left to play soccer. (Google it, I am right.) Baseball is financially out of the reach of a lot of inner city kids, most of them black or Hispanic. Why should baseball repeat the mistakes of cricket?

I love the Red Sox and Fenway. Nobody could love them more, regardless of Price. But it is not fair for the older generation to hold up the way the game is played like a shrine, unchanging, unbending, inflexible.  They won't always be there to sit in the seats.  Some refuse to realize it is too expensive for the young to AFFORD a good seat OR the equipment OR afford Little League.  We do need a shot clock if the game is going to survive. And a massive amount of change, or basketball will pass baseball since black people are not going to wait forever to be re-invited back into a game that screwed them over because hiring a player from the Caribbean or South America was cheaper than them contract wise and the bottom dropped out in their communities.

"Yeah, but in comparison to the Padres who almost blow everyone out of the water in that area. A lot of former top 100 prospects like Morejon, Quantril, Baez, and have new arms like Patino, Cantillo, and potentially Weathers. They don't need to hit on all of them, just need 1 to arise out of all those to be the 3rd guy after Gore and Paddack. Others can become solid pieces. If they can get a veteran arm in FA, you can see how dangerous they can become in the near future.",baseball
"That's what I thought too after losing Harper last year, but the extension just didn't get done. Rendon even said that he'd overrule Boris if the offer is right and that he's not looking to break records, just treated fairly.  These things usually happen at a reasonable time or they don't. I mean look at Trout and Arenado; those guys handled their business and the teams paid their home grown guys big boy money. Nats seem to play a different game. Either they don't have the money or they don't really want to pay top dollar from Rendon.  He's going somewhere else.",baseball

"This is October baseball though managers have to make the tough choices. Scherzer was worse since his return from the DL and Stras/Corbin have been hot. Rather than start his better performing pitcher he defaulted to his #1 guy.

"There's no reason we won't go after Cole. We have the offense, literally everyone in the Front Office knows we need a huge pitching buff to make the push.

"This season Paxton’s KC averaged 81 mph with a Spin Rate of 2013. He saw an average of -3.3 inches of horizontal break and -7.1 inches of vertical break compared to a pitch thrown at the same speed with no spin induced movement. This resulted in opponents achieving a wOBA against of 0.237 and a SwStr% of 11.2%.

Basically he’s got a low spin curve and he will find lots of success if he can miss bats with it. It plays like a slow slider with sharp vertical break. Low spin curveballs usually result in fly balls so as long as he lives low and below the zone it’s a good pitch.",baseball
"So, I know the Yankees have lots of bullpen arms, and many of them are very very good, and there's an off day tomorrow... but I still feel like riding a bullpen this much is asking for trouble later in the series. Especially Game 5 at the end of the three game stretch.

Then again, if the Yankees put their foots on the throat early enough in the series it won't matter how hard they ride the bullpen because the series will be over regardless...

Oh I don't know, it'll be interesting to watch the vastly different approaches that the Nats take versus the Yankees take.",baseball
"You have to 'tag up.' Essentially, the runner has to be touching the base he was originally on when the position player fields a batted ball from the air.

"&gt; He was the reason Tyler's addiction led him to his desth. He couldve stopped him.

No, he couldn't have. I mean, maybe he could've reported him to MLB officials.

Because I'm a recovering addict and that exact thing happened in my life and it actually made things worse, not better.

"agreed. and it's ironic that you mention that, because the harebrained reason the Red Sox fired the man who built that next level team, Dave Dombrowski, is the same reason that Roberts would hypothetically be fired: politics.

even if the dodgers lose every NLCS for 10 years running, it has nothing to do with the manager. i'm not sure if these people calling for his head or assigning blame have never played baseball or if they are just stupid. or both. but the manager always seems to get way too much of the credit and way too much of the blame. there's only so much a manager can do. people seem to think a manager can transform a 80 win team into a 100 win team. the reality is EVERY manager that gets vetted at this level, hired at this level, is by default one of the best baseball decision makers in the world. people are really so self-obsessed that they think they have a more informed, intelligent opinion about a reliever coming in, or batting order lineup, or whatever other minor adjustments a manager makes, than the man who has decades of experience and a billion dollar organization behind him? i guarantee you that 999 times out of 1,000, every manager is thinking about things that fans never even considered. 

so why is there so much turnover? because fans are stupid, and because owners and GMs need a scapegoat when they fail.

hence Dombrowski, who was hamstrung by ownership last winter, takes the fall for something entirely out of his control. do the red sox honestly believe they'll do measurably better with someone other than Dom? of course not. but after a failing season they need to keep up appearances that they are ""making changes"" and that they have a ""Winning culture.""",baseball

"&gt; How many driveline pitchers have actually had sustained success in the majors?

The question is, what is the bar for ""sustained success""? 

The ""best"" pitchers to have spent time with Driveline are probably Bauer and [Ottavino](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/adam-ottavino-rebuilt-himself-in-a-vacant-manhattan-storefront/).

But a lot of their ""success"" is just with extending the careers of guys on the bubble of being out of the majors. [Guys like Dan Straily, who spent most of 2015 in the minors (only 16 MLB innings), but then managed to turn some Driveline training into three (slightly below average) major league seasons from 2016 to 2018](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/the-prescription-that-fixed-dan-straily/).

A lot of guys who go to facilities like Driveline aren't imagining they're going to become the next bona fide Scherzer ace, or even a slightly reinvented ace like Cole or Verlander, *or* even a possible ace / \#2 guy like Bauer. They're at these places to just try and extend their careers by a *few* more years and maybe hit a *few* more paydays. It's not necessarily a super sexy thing, but it matters a lot to guys in positions like that.",baseball
"One, MLB is now forever forbidden from getting salty if teams/agents/players make announcements during the playoffs, something it has historically frowned upon.

Two, this is complete and utter bullshit.  MLB is fucking swimming in cash to a degree that would embarass Scrooge fucking McDuck.  Those players can be paid better now.  That equipment can be upgraded now.  Those facilities can be upgraded or replaced now.  And the cost of all of the above amounts to little more than a rounding error on the balance sheet of even the least wealthy franchises.

Three, this is going to do massive economic and cultural damage to the forty communities that suddenly lose their affiliations.  Those teams are all significant pieces of their local economies.  In addition to the jobs which range from great professional opportunities to best high school job ever, they’re big players in local charities, little leagues, schools, and all of the other civic organizations.  Part of the fabric of these communities is baseball jerseys, goddammit.

Four, MLB doesn’t own these teams.  Most of the time the parent club doesn’t own these teams.  They just have contracts for player development with agreed upon funding/compensation terms.  A lot of them are multi-generation family businesses.  Suddenly that dies.

Fifth, MLB is talking about expansion.  If there is room to add MLB teams, there is room to add MiLB teams.  It is the height of hypocrisy to cry poverty about the costs of A ball while trying to shoehorn in more MLB teams.

The fact that the Yanks have even been relevant in the 2010's never mind completely reinvented themselves automatically precludes them from being a disappointment.  Never mind all the way the Dodgers have pushed themselves to the fore for this consideration.  This Astros teams will go down as one of the best teams of all time.  Most teams are either a bunch of scrappy hitters that are supporting some stud pitchers and score just enough to win (the Posey Giants, Randy/Kurt Dbacks, ...), or a bunch of bashers that hit their way through.  This team is both.  

Let's make a look at all of those great NL teams that gave the Dodgers a hard time in the 2010's vs what the Yankees have had to deal with.  lol",baseball
"And I understand that. Having consistency in that regard is nice, but I guess I'm more of a purist in this regard to not get rid of the human element. Like someone else commented, the catcher framing the pitches is an art on its own, and going to a robo ump for balls and strikes would eliminate that artform",baseball
"Brett Gardner is basically the same age as me, give or take a few weeks. He's the epitome of me realizing that pros my age aren't retiring early anymore, they're simply done. So his bat mashing and dong hitting season has been particularly meaningful to me. All season my wife has had to listen to me yell at the television: ""You and me Brett, riding into the sunset together!""",baseball
"Same man. One year I got some preseason magazine and memorized the opening day roster of every team. So all that year I’d “play” the Os game after school before the real game started.

The basic play was “pitch” it directly at the wall to create a grounder, field it, then short hop the wall with my throw so it’d come back to me on the fly and I’d then be the first baseman catching it. 

I had a whole system to determine hits but mostly I’d just “make an error” to let the Os score as needed. Or I’d make a “mistake pitch” which was short topping the wall with a steeper angle so the “hit” would go over my head for a home run.

Fuck being a kid was so cool. I’d play now if my neighbors wouldn’t call for a welfare check.",baseball
"Hey Mike thanks for taking my call, first time long time. Do you think up 6-0, the Yankees hitters would be better off just getting themselves into some outs? I mean you don't want to let the Astros pitching staff figure out all our hitters' stuff this early in the series",baseball
"Never hear anything bad about him, and seems hands off. Favorite thing about him is after one of our players hit a HR on Mother's Day, the bat was auctioned on mlb.com and Attanasio won it for $25,000 then gave the bat to the player's mother. Seems like a good dude.",baseball
"Just realized I went to a Nats game this year so it might be the first time I can say I saw a World Series team in person.

I don't remember much of that game because we were in the nosebleeds and I have a paralyzing fear of heights, but it still counts.",baseball
The Constitution specifically does not allow armed insurrection against the government or shooting people you disagree with. But it does specially mention the penalities for treason so there's that. Also couldn't resist getting China in there so you could tell us all how much you care about what's going on over there huh?,baseball
"I felt pretty bad for Randy Dobnak the other day. Dude’s story is incredibly inspirational, it’s amazing that he was even in the position that he was in. And most of the runs the Yankees scored came in after he was out of the game (even if they were charged to Dobnak, he wasn’t the pitcher that plated them). But after the game it seemed like all the commentary was in jest about his former turn as an Uber driver. Even if his start didn’t to well, I have nothing but the highest respect and admiration for him for making it to that stage. I hope he has a long and successful career.",baseball
"Technically, Acuna did a throat slash when he got the final out after game 3. Nobody mentioned it because it was very innocuous. If this is what they were referencing, then OK, but damn is that just being sensitive. I took Ronalds gesture as just ""game over""... the same way a pitcher pumps his fists and jumps around the infield.",baseball
"Ok so it might seem i'm defending him cause fan bias but, tempers were flared in this series already, acuna was almost hbp twice in one at bat by carlos martinez earlier this series, maybe acuna using hand gestures to tell flaherty he won't stfu was a bit too much tho. But the point is like, flaherty is saying acuna has been having antics all series? like bro he's just playing the game and martinez has been coming at his ass like crazy he's just annoyed at getting hit by pitches in retaliation to shit (by the marlins) last year and this year.",baseball
"And the probability of a successful bunt with two strikes and the corner infielders 30 feet from home plate is really low. If it's foul, it's a strike out. If it's hit hard down the line, it's a double play. Stras is a .167 hitter and Buehler has been throwing him balls all night. He probably had as much of a chance of reaching base by playing it straight up on 3-2 as he had of actually executing the bunt play.",baseball
"And I would actually say that it's BECAUSE his velo went down. He is throwing waaay more curveballs and had get more creative with his aresenal. That has been key to his change. He also just looks so much more confident because if it, like he broke a code for solving his struggles from past years. That's why he'll be pitching til he's 40 years old. That CC Sabithia Verlander type shit.",baseball
"Not sure how much more clear it can be. Run wherever you want but if you are perceived to be in the way of the play you will be called out unless you are in your lane until the end when you have a right to move to the bag. Not sure how any logical person can disagree with the call made.


""shitty rules"" are in the books for a reason. Something caused it.",baseball
"Sports in the 21st century is when for some reason we forgot all core basics of the games we've played for generations. 

We're redefining what a strike is, base path, catch in football, what a tackle is. 

When does this end? That was the first thing that was collectively decided upon to start these sports in the first place",baseball
"You're right, but his name was the one that was getting thrown around by Taubman, so I'm just wondering if the Astros are going to steer clear of any negative attention at all or if they decide to put in their closer regardless.

It's honestly a tough call, but you probably have to put him in since the games are so important",baseball
"I think you can do whatever you want. If you got a guy who wants to pitch whole games everyday you can do that. Iirc it used to be that way back in the day when men were men with elegant moustaches. As we learn more about bodily stress and health we started taking pitchers out more often. Now starters are best used on many days rest. There's nothing stopping you from using Cole everyday, except for the fact you'd probably take years off of Cole's career.",baseball
"&gt; We can’t expect perfection and in fact can’t really judge what perfection is. It’s all subjective. The white box on tv is not an  official strike zone. 

What? The strike zone is capable of being objectively defined and we can expect robots to get calls right much closer to 100% of the time than people. And each umpire having his own zone is a huge problem.",baseball
"So I'm not one to harp on Sanchez's defense but how is that a wild pitch? It bounced right in front of him and he tried to backhand it. Passed ball IMO. 

When I played behind the plate if a ball got by me after I tried to backhand and didn't even drop I would have been reamed.",baseball

"That's not a judgment call at all.  There's a line that indicates fair or foul.  If the ball goes on one side, it's fair or foul.  The baseline rule is a judgment based on whether the batter made an honest attempt to run the basepath correctly.

Of which the umpire's judgment was bullshit.",baseball
"Correct call. “In running the last half of the distance from home base to first base, while the ball is being fielded to first base, he runs outside (to the right of) the three-foot line, or inside (to the left of) the foul line, and in the umpire's judgment in so doing interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first base...”. Please reply to me if you disagree",baseball

Joe Buck fucking sucks. Maybe you just watch one baseball game a week or something but as someone who watches football, golf and baseball I’ve formed enough of an opinion based on hearing him way too much to know he’s fucking awful. “””””a disgusting act””” is enough to hate the man but you’ve probably only been watching sports for a couple months based on how fucking stupid your comment is",baseball
"What he means is, why aren't people criticizing Markakis for taking forever to throw the ball in. He knows Fowler is fast, the only possible play is at 3rd, why is he taking three hops to get the ball in the infield? Fowler was almost out as it was, if Markakis hadn't been lazy, that might have drastically changed the outcome of the game.

That was a bigger mistake than Acuña made, as far as the outcome of the game is concerned. Yet no one is asking or talking about that.",baseball

Fine if you want to do them between innings and show it later, though they're still stupid...but no one cares and what the hell is he gonna tell us live in-game? Ugh. So annoyed.",baseball
"The thing is it's not just that inning, but the whole series. Toronto hasn't been to a play off game in over 20 years and the first thing they do is loose the first 2 games. A game away from being eliminated all they have to do is fly down to Texas, win 2 games there, fly back to Toronto and win game 5. Their backs against the wall the entire time and they did the near impossible. Then the 7th inning mimics the series. The strangest oddity puts the Jays down yet again and they just need to do the impossible one more time. 

That Bautista home was a huge relief. For a team that was constantly tying to keep their heads above water, gasping for air before being pulled back under, the Jays finally found solid footing. They stood up out of the water, took a deep breath and finally knew they were going to be okay, symbolized by the flipping of a bat.",baseball
"In my mind, making a point of saying there is going to be more bunting, that is effectively going willy nilly. There aren't a lot of instances where giving away an out is going to be as beneficial as moving a runner up a base. Maybe you use your 9th to do this every once in a while, but beyond that, i don't see it as a useful enough tool to go out of your way to say that it will be happening more.  
  
Unless of course he means that they are going to practice it so that on the off chance they need it they have it. That would be reasonable. And also for hits. Unless he is talking about against the shift in the third inning. Leading off late, that's cool, that's when you want to whip that out, when it really matters. So there's reasons, just not what everyone thinks straight off.",baseball
"Armando Galarraga had a clear perfect game blown during the 27th at bat when the umpire [blew an out at first](https://youtu.be/vmncfTtoZN8) (jump to 4:55). Calling this correctly would have recorded a perfect game. The umpire later admitted he was wrong.

Max Scherzer had a potential perfect game blown during the 27th at bat when the batter [deliberately elbowed a pitch](https://youtu.be/rhe7yJEaNoc) to get on base. The rules explicitly state that a batter must try to get out of the way of the pitch in order to be awarded a base. Otherwise the ball should be called as a pitch or a ball depending on where it was when the batter was hit. Calling this correctly as a ball would make the count 3-2, giving Scherzer the ability to finish the game or the ability to blow the perfect game on his own merits.",baseball

"Here’s how I saw it...

Turner was going to be safe with or without the interference. But the runners would not have advanced to 2nd &amp; 3rd without the interference. Since he was still between home &amp; 1st when he interfered, the only possible call is for him to be out and put the other runner back at first.

"DC is a bigger market than Houston though

"Honestly, this is one of the most bizarre aspects of the sport to me. I've heard that it boosts team morale the harder a manager ""fights"" for his team during tough moments, getting ejected on purpose. But it just looks ridiculous and counterproductive from a spectator perspective. 

I don't play baseball video games anymore, but one I had around the turn of the millenium even gamefied the manager argument. You tapped a button to get more fired up until you were ejected, and doing so would either buff or nerf your team depending on if the call was ""worth it"".",baseball

"Has anyone ever wondered what that song “Saved by Zero” by The Fixx is about? According to Wikipedia:

""It was about looking at your own life, not so much about amassing material things but about experiences that lend you to be blissful...

It clears your head of all fears and panics and illusions and you get back to the basics, which is a Buddhist mantra, which I practiced back then, and which I still do. He just looked me in the eye and asked ‘Have the Dodgers won a World Series since 1988?’ I said ‘no’ and we just both fucking laughed at those losers.",baseball
"If you're standing on a base (in this case it was 2nd base) at the moment the ball is caught, you can then run to the next base (3rd base and beyond) if you think you can beat the ball there. It's a tag out though, not a force out. So the other team has to tag you before you reach the next base.

If you start running to the next base before the ball is caught though, you're out.",baseball
"Scherzer has only been runner-up once, and he was a full .020 behind Kershaw that year. Scherzer’s best single-season ERA (0.251) would have lead the league only four times in the past 20 seasons. It would have come in second only 8 times.

On the other hand, he lead the league in strike outs three years in a row would have made it four if he wasn’t injured this year. He lead the league in SO9 still and fell one start shy of leading the league in strikeouts (243 to de Grom’s 255). Using last year’s IP numbers to do projection, he was on track for 310 strikeouts this year.",baseball

"He is supposed to run in the runner’s lane, then exit when he moves to step toward the bag. At least that’s what the rules require. Obviously he can do whatever he wants, but if he does not do it as the rule book requires, he is subject to a runner’s lane violation if he interferes.",baseball

" Credit to u/radentch

nobody should be surprised at any of this. Houston is just a completely a garbage sports city that always pretends they’re the victims even though the refs favor their shitty teams at every single point.

With the Rockets you have refs giving Harden ridiculous calls that literally nobody else gets and overall lowering the quality of basketball whenever hes on the court. The fact that Harden can shoot 20%FG and average 30 points on bullshit free throws is a testament to how soulless and garbage Houston sports teams are in general

With the Texans, I don’t even need to bring up the number of times NFL refs have given them favorable calls in clutch situations.

And now we’re seeing it here in a third major league spot. With the Astros you havce umpires who are giving them BS calls at every single turn to help them win important games. They’re basically fixing the world series game by game and screwing over a more deserving team in the Nats just so they can sell more jerseys to a large market city.

I would say no, as the batter was never entitled to be at third.

Now my wee little brain hurts... but I would again say no, because at the time the batter arrived at third he was not entitled to be there as the base was already occupied. Doesn't matter what happened later.

Think about it this way: if the batter reached and stopped at second, then the runner on third went home, and then the batter advanced to third, that would be ruled a double.

Oh, please, NO... but anyway, I have no idea as there was no reason for the batter to *retreat* to second base.",baseball

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ""You all need to pay for those first.” At first they kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, they stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, they kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",baseball
"that makes no sense. the robot was right in calling a strike because it was a strike. 

so now hitters have to hit every pitch in the strike zone rather than the ones they know they can get away with? and pitchers can now throw nastier pitches? all while being 100% accurate with no team at the end blaming the ump for bad pitching calls. sounds like wins all around count me in",baseball
"|It hurts no one and makes things fair.

I'm for the change to robo-umps but its not 100% true that it doesn't hurt anyone. It de-values what umpires do, even if they keep their jobs and nominally their wages are the same in the short term. New/Future umps would probably get paid less.  

I worked at a bottling plant before where we replaced fork lift drivers with robo fork lift drivers.  No one at the plant lost their job because another line was added, but in aggregate, human jobs were replaced by robot ones.",baseball
"Astros are the bad guys, Nats are the good guys. Astros are the better team on paper, had a much better season, but the Nats are just inconceivably hot and a really, really cool team. Nats have also gotten screwed a couple of times this series with calls. Astros also had some bad PR about domestic abuse.",baseball
Because you don't make up for runs you lost. The game doesn't work like that. We don't excuse his behavior here because he hit a 2 run home run later. That doesn't get back the run he lost by not hustling here or the run he lost by trying to steal second in the first.,baseball
"Didi is a huge improvement defensively over Voit and Gleyber. Because of that, and DJ being so damn good, the entire infield is way better with him at SS. Without him, Gardner is your only lefty in the lineup. Not to mention Didi had a habit of being special in the postseason (i.e 2017 WC game and his 2017 ALDS Game 5). While Voit when healthy is special as well, I don't think I would build a lineup without Didi unless there was some serious matchup deficit.",baseball
"I can see the argument but the follow up question is can you honestly imagine someone actually choosing where they hit the ball off Cole or Verlander? You have to take what they give you and if they take away the inside pitches that you can hit the other way, then you’re kinda out of luck",baseball
"&gt;Bad luck doesn't result in two straight WS losses

It takes a good team to make the world series. Generally you go into the series with a 50% chance of winning.

Losing twice is 25% odds. Just flip two coins, if they both land tails then you have the same luck as the Dodgers.

Also, they are going into game 5 with home field advantage. They didn't lose the NLDS.",baseball
"Remember back in 2013 when a bunch of those Heat fans left the AA Arena in Game 6 of the NBA Finals when it looked like the Spurs would close the series out?

"The year is 2029.

Long after having been forgotten by the mainstream media and casual fan, Clayton Kershaw barely makes a postseason roster as a mid reliever.

But then he shockingly catches fire. He can’t miss his spots. Unhitable.

He gets the save in all three game for round one with 8 strikeouts. No walks.

In round two, he comes out of the pen once again and earns two saves while allowing zero runs and striking out six. He is easily the mvp.

Then in the big dance. The memories of his postseason struggles re-emerge. That’s all the media has to talk about. Will he be used again?

In game two, barely holding a one run lead, Kershaw is summoned from the bullpen. The league MVP at the plate and runners on second and third.

But there is not a prayer.

One down.

Two down.

Three down.

All the world is abuzz but despite Kershaws efforts, the series goes to seven.

After a 17 inning marathon in game 6, there is only one answer. Only one available pitcher. 

The former legend who has re-emerges with awe-inspiring grandeur.
Clayton Kershaw.

He strikes out the side to begin the game.

He cruises along and somewhere around the 6th inning, there is buzz that he’s got a perfect game going.

One by one, the champions of the American League have no answer.

To the 9th.

But through the 9th.

The score is 0-0.

Kershaws fatigue shows but he is determined. To finally defeat the haunting demons of his 
earlier, hall of game career.

At the plate in the bottom of the 10th, with a perfect game intact, is the boy from Texas.

On an 0-2 count he gets a fastball.

He doesn’t miss.

And with the crack of the bat, a legacy of disappointment and failure evaporates.

The ball sails over the wall and the searies is over.

A walkoff home run to complete a perfect game 7.

In tears the 40 year old turns the corner at third. His teammates 90 feet away. He steps on 
the bag.

It’s over.

The stigma. The opinions. The haters. They have nowhere to go.

At the podium, Kershaw begins to break down.

“I wanted a ring, I couldn’t walk away with out it.”

He sobs through the presentation and turns toward the owner.

“When no one believed in me, you did. I’m so thankful for the opportunity!”

Then the team makes their way to the dugout and tunnel. Kershaw is the last.

He looks back to make sure it is all real.

He glances to the heavens and smiles.

He looks up at the board and grins.

It’s happened.

It’s real.

The scoreboard confirms it.

The San Francisco Giants have won the World Series.",baseball

He lived a bit in Maryland after college, and I don't think he had a main baseball team until then. However I do remember him talking about the Orioles teams from before he moved there too (loved the Robinsons and Palmer and they're definitely before then). Maybe his parents took him there for games? Never asked probably should, just remember him and my mom (from a Yankees family since they were the Highlanders) having fun with those match ups.",baseball
"I have no idea why Zack didn't argue his position.  If that were John Lackey out there, he would been yelling at Hinch to stay in the dugout.  I mean this is the 7th game of hte fucking World Series, and you are going to pull me after 80 pitches.  Hell no, I am arguing either let me get this guy out and finish this inning or if I give up a hit or walk then pull me.",baseball
"There are very few players who fit that bill, and even fewer who are available. Really, the Mets should be looking to invest their resources into pitching. Any CF they're looking for should be a bench type, as they currently have Davis/Nimmo/Conforto, with both Smith and Cespedes available. The resources they'd have to give up to acquire this type of player are too high relative to the marginal improvement.",baseball
"Minnesota vs Milwaukee pls. I-94 would be completely clogged, just undrivable. Megabusses to Chicago and back would just have to take backroads. There would be cheese curd stands all along the freeway, farther than the eyes can see, from downtown to downtown. Lots of trucker caps that say ""Git-R-Dun."" Lots of Hamm's Light. Nobody would quote Shakespeare. Nobody would quote Joe Buck. And the umpires would not care who wins. Thats all that really matters.",baseball
"two issues with your interpretation. First, if he'd been running in the lane the whole time, he would've been further right by the time he exited the lane to tag the base. This would've made him less likely to hit the glove. Maybe he still would've hit the glove, maybe not, now we'll never know. but by coming from outside the lane and plowing directly ahead, he put himself further left than he's supposed to be.

2nd issue (the legalese issue). As you said, ""the batter-runner is permitted to exit..."". Well, he didn't exit, because he was never in the lane in the first place. So what he did was against the rules.",baseball
"How is that mental gymnastics? He runs down first base line with one foot in the grass most of the way and then when he should have just been safe at first he hits Gurriel's glove out of his hand and causes him to miss the ball

You can clearly see him knock the glove out on what should have just been an infield base hit",baseball

"(I hate that I'm using the Astros as the 'bad guys' in yet another scenario)

At what point is there an argument that the Astros shouldn't be in the WS, and instead it should be the Yankees or Rays representing the AL?

Like, let's say there have been months of investigative journalism and mid-WS it has legit come out that half the Astros 40-man roster has been using Steroids with organizational approval. Do those guys get banned and the Nationals pretty much walk to victory? Does Houston get a forced forfeit?

Or do they just re-do the ALCS with the Yankees and Rays, maybe in a shortened 3-game format, so that a 'rightful' and 'clean' team can play in the WS?",baseball
"I remember being insanely confused the last three years. I was happy with the team they were building (not anymore) but felt confused when people kept saying “and they are going to be under the luxury tax.

"Can't speak for other Yankee fans, but I am not salty about losing this series. I am disappointed, but the team has no one to blame but themselves. Squandered several opportunities throughout the series and simply couldn't get the job done. 

End of the day, Astros were the superior team. 

Also how do I put the Yankees in my header? Do I have to subscribe to the sub-reddit?",baseball
"Brewers fan. This sucks to holy hell but I don't pin this on Grisham. Sucks Hader couldn't find his zone too but I don't know if the collapse is wholly on him either. Truth is we made an incredible run without the NL MVP and our AllStar Closer.

Hoping next year has more to look forward to.",baseball

Godd call bringing Kershaw i for that one out.

Terrible call not bringing the setuo man and finishing with jansen inthe 8th and 9th.

Kelly did his thing getting 3 outs.  Terribble call keeping him in there past that especially after seeing his shit wasnt breaking as much as it was in the 9th.  He kept jansen on the bench when he should have used him in the 10th.  That 1 out was just like keeping him on the bench now he can say ""well....he was in the game.""

This is all on Roberts",baseball

Ausmus got dealt a shitty hand, injuries, and the worst thing you can deal with in a season with Tyler's death. And before you bring up 09 and Adenhart, that was actually a good team, that was the last year of the Angels 3 year division champion streak before it started to fall apart.

Theres no manager out there that makes this years team a playoff team, or a team that loses less than 80 games on that note.",baseball
And I don’t doubt the rest of the astros are great people (except maybe Bergman but that’s a whole different debate) and I do agree people should have an opportunity for redemption. Maybe Osuna has turned around but that doesn’t mean people will forget what he did. This will linger over him for the rest of his career.,baseball
"Oh they will for sure. There’s uncertainty surrounding what is quite frankly an average roster. Sure, you have Nola, Harper, Realmuto and... yeah in a lot of ways that’s about it. Cutch is old. Hoskins struggles in the second half. Segura is good, but he didn’t seem to do a whole lot for the team. Herrera probably won’t come back.

I'd imagine that's about how I'd sound if someone threw me in front of a few dozen cameras and asked about how I felt about some coworker who'd definitely be around",baseball
"Hot take: the missed call on that hurt the Yankees because it gave no chance for Sanchez to run on the Strike 3 (not that he is known for speed). The makeup call gave a clean strikeout where that would have been a long/rushed throw. I'd rather have Sanchez with an extra chance to hit, but that didnt happen with the makeup call, so running on strike 3 was the best outcome there.",baseball

You’re overthinking this, MLB controls everything. So they decide who’s allowed into the games, or not. It’s a business corporation and Rob Manfred is the boss, and everyone, even the owners, are subject to the code of conduct.

"my point is that, according to you, if Tanaka threw the ball at the runner, then the runner would have been out. Tanaka did not throw the ball at the runner BECAUSE Tanaka knew that if he did, then the runner would have gone to second.

Tell me if that is correct. Watch that play. If Tanaka threw to first and hit the runner, would the runner have been out?",baseball
"I think you're right except for saying ""I don't think it was right""

You just don't criticize or go against your guy/teammate 

Baseball teams won't criticize unless it's like poking fun at them if they played bad but they still won in a blowout game or as a team as a whole like ""we played like garbo on offense/defense.""

Take that out and it's a decent statement. I still do think transparency is important and stating why the umpires made a call  is good to inform the viewer why a call was made. Torre did it here (I know there's conflicting stuff out there but I don't want to dive into that) and it got people more mad but at least we were given a reason. 

Couple what you said, minus that comment, plus transparent call and it's a good statement. You see why they made the call, will review it in the future, and improve from it. Sucks that it happened on the biggest stage and it could have had major implications/tragic consequences for the Nats. Thankfully it didn't.",baseball
"Regardless of what happens in game 5, This series going to 5 games was the worst possible outcome for the Astros.  Either they lose game 5 and their season is over or not being able to start Verlander and Cole in games 1 and 2 of the ALCS.  I give the Yankees a better than 50% chance of stealing game 1 or 2 at Minute Maid without Verlander and Cole Pitching.  

If the Astros make it to the ALCS, they are in for an absolute dog fight without having their top guns to start the series.",baseball
"I haven't read anything about that case in several years, but I think I remember it being more nuanced than ""convicted child molester"". Not defending any side, but what I do seem to recall that (his defense at least) was that despite lack of evidence the jury was going to convict him and his legal defense recommended he take the plea deal. Am I wrong in thinking that the opinion was at least somewhat split on whether he actually did what he was convicted of?

Once again, lol please internet, not making any claims. Just genuinely curious what the consensus is now since the news story has settled and the picture has become ostensibly clearer. The article I remember reading seemed to take a somewhat sympathetic position to the case.",baseball
"&gt;a round in which they are already overmatched

This might be a bit off, but by my count, Wild Card teams have won 45 playoff series all-time and lost 40. This includes 6 World Champions and 12 pennant winners. I would have to say the Wild Card teams have historically held their own just fine.

EDIT: Just did a little more digging. In both the AL and NL, the wild card team (including WCG winners) have advanced to the LCS 12 out of 24 times. In the Wild Card Game era, the WCG champ has advanced to the LCS 3 out of 7 times in each league. I think it’s safe to say Wild Card teams are not overmatched at all in the postseason.",baseball

"Osuna. Beat his ~~wife~~ girlfriend and shouldn't be playing. Hard to cheer for him out there and easy to get pissed when he blows a save.


Edit: No amount of downvotes can change reality. The only reason that Osuna got a plea deal is because his girlfriend/ child's mother would not return to Canada from Mexico to testify. The league suspended and fined him finding he violated the domestic abuse policy, and neither the blue Jays, Osuna, nor the player's association appealed.",baseball
"That’s the part people don’t seem to really be taking into account here. It’s big picture. It’s late in an elimination game, you have the winning run on base and a pitcher is up to bat.

"This goes back to the urban/rural split. You've probably heard this before, in the city your kids play on a swing set paid for by your taxes, in the country your kids play on the swing set you build in your backyard.

So long as people in cities find value in social services (public transportation, public parks, police, fire, ems, sanitation, road repairs, education, etc) it will be near impossible to convince them not to rely on the government to provide them. I'm very pro business and free trade and far from a socialist and I'm not convinced that privatizing these is necessarily the most efficient way to go.

I'd say, if Felix signs a deal someplace and reinvents himself and becomes at the very least a reliable number 3 starter, or even a reliable bullpen arm and then stays that way for a couple more years...

"I mean, I agree from a proper moral stand point...yes, I want every member of society happy and producing in a positive way. That only leads to world peace and a better life for everyone.

I want to answer honestly, though.

Let's say my childhood bully that abused me mentally and physically for years fucked up and went to prison. I'd enjoy the moment, and then reflect and hope he changes for the better for the sake of *others* because I genuinely don't care if he succeeds and feels happy himself.

Hamilton is like 1/10th of what I feel for the mentioned bully; he's a famous sports figure, so I don't actually know him, but I don't respect the human he is. Yes, as a player he's a shitty Angel, but I try not to let that influence my opinion as much as the other things I don't like about him. It's not even the drug addiction. I don't like him being he sent video to the Rangers while playing with us - that shows how little he cared about the contract and from a professional stand point that should be a fireable offense. He put in half effort - again, being paid how he was, what he was suppose to be - that's shitty. He specifically praised the Rangers organization and specifically left out the Angels during his retirement speech. He basically destroyed his career after sliding into first base head first (??) and sticking his arm out. I remember a game where the Angels walked it off, and he literally just stayed in the dugout, frowning while the team celebrated. It was years of following him and forming an opinion that led to him being my least favorite player of all time.

Sooo..I suppose I do hope he figures it out, for the sake of his family not being abused. I hope he turns around and finds something other than Jesus since that didn't work out, and spends the rest of his life actually making a positive difference.",baseball

"I didn't tune in til the 5th or so, but I thought that was an excellent broadcast. No bullshit, just 100% focus on the game in front of them. Girardi dominated, but I never really got tired of him. I thought just about everything he had to say was interesting and worthwhile. The game wasn't a sideshow, it was the whole presentation. Girardi was thinking along with every pitch and situation, and Pierzynski (ironically the one who had the reputation of being a motormouth as a player) was right there with him. AJ wasn't nearly as chatty, but he also had the occasional solid insight/well-timed joke and Kenny Albert deserves credit for realizing he should shut up and mostly get out of the way of the other two. The lack of talking about any and every dumbass thing apart from the game was really refreshing, and I hope the other networks paid attention.

Broadcasts that treat baseball games like something that aren't interesting enough by themselves and have to be continually interrupted by a three-ring circus of bullshit are annoying. What Girardi demonstrated is how to keep it compelling without having to bury casual fans in numbers, or try to distract them with nonsense. I wish more broadcasts were like that.",baseball
"A what turned into a single by Maldy initially went to the wall and would've scored in a run with Tucker scoring. But the ball hit the stool the bat boy was sitting on (I believe he was supposed to like lift up the stool or something), and it richochete'd off the stool and went to the LF. 

Instead of the LF having to run more to get to the ball and giving enough time for Tucker to score a run, it bounced off the stool with a lot of speed and went to the LF and saving a run. 

Now mind you we still should've scored a run, but Springer and Altuve were horrendous in the AB after",baseball
"Well, if Trea Turner thinks its harsh he should, ya know, follow the rules.

They are put in place to promote fair play. It is strictly enforced because if it isn't strictly enforced players will do this all the time. As it is, simply because the play is *rare* players do it all the time knowing it's unlikely they will be sanctioned so perhaps umpires should start calling runner's out for this situation whether or not they interfered with the play... in the name of public awareness &amp; consistency.",baseball
"On a logical level, I agree with you. For me, when it comes time to put food in mouth, it's just too on the nose, but that applies to everything you mentioned. I wouldn't eat any of those animals in a whole form. If you made crickets into a burger, and you told me how they were raised away from disease, and probably called it something different (like how cow meat is called beef), I would happily eat it.

But I'm also the same way for say mushrooms. I love mushrooms, but I'm too anxious to try any kind other than farmed button mushrooms. Also, I probably wouldn't dog an individual for eating crickets",baseball
"I just visited Québec a few weeks ago and was surprised by how many Expos caps I saw everywhere.  They're still carrying a torch for Les Expos for sure.  And it's a shame they don't even have a minor league team, especially given their [significant place in baseball history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Royals#History).",baseball
"A report recently came out that claimed Dan Snyder was furious at the Caps Stanley Cup run because he wants all the attention of sports fans in DC (even though the Skins get an extremely disproportionate amount of it, especially relative to their success) and having other teams be successful makes Snyder see them as a threat. Also he’s frustrated seeing the Caps and Nats have exceptional front offices (Wizards, not so much) and wondering why his moves with the Skins football operations haven’t been as successful.

Meanwhile the Caps and Nats have been BFFs to each other during their respective postseason runs the past several years. Zimmerman and Scherzer led a chant during the SCF, the Caps celebrated the Cup win the next day at Nats Park,  members of both teams are often spotted with the others’ gear, and both teams’ social accounts are very active with each other. 

FWIW, there’s a sizable segment of Caps and Nats fans that aren’t Redskins fans at all. A couple reasons: 1) Skins fans are usually area natives, transplants have been much more likely to pick up the Caps or Nats since they’ve been winning, 2) the DMV area, especially DC proper, skews extremely liberal and Snyder’s politics and the Redskins name drive some would be fans away from the team.",baseball
"ehh with the chance to win it and close it out with kershaw on good rest (this wasnt his first time in relief). this was a good move. 3 pitch stike out on the batter before. then 3 more pitches and 2 more home runs. this part of the game was on kershaw, not roberts",baseball
"Gotcha very good point. Although is this really that common for plays other than where a runner misses a bag? Maybe im just dumb. 

Solution to that imo would be to censor the image of the ump but that would take significant time when done by someone. Although maybe it wouldn't with some type of coding? If I can put Lana Rhoades face on Angel Hernandez's body with AI then the MLB should be able to somehow not have a umps call shown in a non-broadcasted video replay in a short amount of time. 

I just absolutely can't stand that the call on the field influences the call made by New York.",baseball
"Hey guys, I am a new spectator of this sport so I got a question: How do the pitchers get picked for the games in a particular series? Can one team ""counterpick"" the other team by knowing which pitcher they are starting? Like they know the opponent starts their 3rd best so the other team adjusts and starts a better pitcher, as an example. Just curious.",baseball
"I'd wager quite a bit though tbh. Harris went out yesterday and went out again tonight. You don't have to pitch 3 innings either. I bet they could have used both Hudson and Doolittle tonight and brought the game back to winnable.

Then again, who knows if Bregman would have hit that GS anyways. He had pent up frustration from the last couple games, so you know he was looking to hit haha",baseball
"I disagree with that comparison. Elected officials need high moral character to do their job. You need to understand and practice good ethical judgment to write and enforce laws. We should hold elected officials to a higher standard because it’s required for their job.

I think it’s kind of silly to lump all famous people into the same bucket and say we need to treat them all extra hard wrt the law. Government officials? Yes. Athletes and actors? No. They should be treated the same as janitors and architects.",baseball
"The collective bargaining agreement with the umpires expires at the end of this season. So, I suspect there may be a broaching of the subject of computer-assisted strike calls. In any case, this technology must first be tested much more extensively in the minors under varying conditions to get  a sense of its veracity. Players, pitchers, catchers and umpires need to get used to this as well, and make necessary adjustments.  
I think the player's union would back the umpires in this one respect: computers may be indeed more accurate and consistent in calling balls and strikes, but how  will system define the strike zone ? Are we going strictly by the rule book or by the way the strike zone has been defined in practice? Who gets to decide? Does the strike zone change from year to year?

This would potentially have a profound effect on hitters, pitchers and catchers.  

And finally how long will it take for teams to conduct their own experiments using this same equipment? Can a competitive advantage be had by exploiting some weakness in the technology? For example, say through manipulation of how the strike zone is perceived?",baseball
"As I understand it, this is incorrect. Hernandez’ argument is that he has seniority and that Torre holds his Cuban heritage against him. 

MLB subpoenaed Hernandez’s private evaluations by the Umpires Union and his lawyers are blocking this. The legal aspects would be a bit more complicated as to whether blocking the subpoena could have other motivations than simply keeping bad internal reviews private. 

Point is, as far as I’m aware, Hernandez alleges racism as the reason he is held back and seniority as to why he should not be. His reviews by the union have been kept quiet and I don’t know of him citing them as evidence that he deserves to be in the WS crew.

If I’m incorrect, feel free to correct me with sources, though.",baseball
"I'm actually looking into it now, and I think the reporter misspoke. Cole has tied **second place** for most K's in a **single** postseason (47, tied with Josh Becket 2003, Randy Johnson 2001, Cliff Lee 2010).  Curt Schilling got 56 K's in 2001, 9 ahead of those four.

It's, uh, highly unlikely Cole gets 9 more strikeouts this postseason.",baseball
"Is there as storied of a franchise in as solid of an overall market as the Pirates to be this awful for this long?

Like we can say the Knicks or some other teams in different leagues but there is something about the fact that this owner is allowed to run a team with this much history into the dirt that is so jarring to me.",baseball
"I kind of hate that dude a little bit because he always shits on the Twins (not without reason, they tried to make him hit it the other way...but that was 20 years ago) and he inexplicably gets a pass on the roids stuff. I hope Odo comes up big and pitches 8 flawless innings (he won’t, they’re almost certainly going to lose).",baseball
"&gt;The domestic abuser shouldn't be employed either

I know this is unpopular, but at what can he be employed again?   


Like, he now has no right to play baseball? He served the suspension, he did the time for the crime did he not?  


At what point do we just give him the death penalty for this crime?",baseball
"&gt;  He played halfback and Oklahoma offered him a football scholarship. His football playing nearly ended his athletic career. In his sophomore year, he was kicked on the left shin during a practice game, and he developed osteomyelitis—a crippling disease that was incurable just a few years earlier—in his left ankle. Mantle's parents drove him at midnight to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, where he was treated at the children's hospital with the newly available penicillin, which reduced the infection and saved his leg from amputation.

Don't think you can really compare Trout's (or like 99.9% of athletes) injuries to Mantle's

Tangent:  Mantle would've been offered a scholarship by Bud Wilkinson.

From 1947-1963 Wilkinson's OU teams went 145-29-4, won three National Championships (with two other undefeated seasons), and had a 47 game winning streak that still remains the longest winning streak in D1 history.

He is also the inventor of the Oklahoma drill.

It's safe to say if Wilkinson thought Mantle was good enough to play halfback for his Sooners, Mantle was a *really* good running back.",baseball
This isn’t shocking to me at all. Maybe a week or two ago someone posted a gif of Julio Urias (who has also been suspended for domestic violence) throwing his water cup or something leaving the bullpen to pitch in the NLDS and everyone was happy to make jokes and lol in that thread. The league and the fans are far too dismissive of DV issues imo,baseball
"Thousands of years from now, these tickets will be unearthed still preserved enough to read. History books will be rewritten as this ancient game of “Major League Baseball.” At the center of it all will be the Seattle Mariners, winners of the mythical clash named the “World Series” from the year 2001. The Mariners will finally be world champions.",baseball
"I’m researching this as a potential thesis topic and I’ve barely gotten into it but from what I’ve gotten so far, they have this near-perfectly cooperative system of feedback/analysis software, player simulations, and pitching coaches that can connect all the dots. So they know who they can and can’t maximize, every pitcher they acquire has been studied in crazy detail and, according to their system, can be an elite pitcher according to their methods, which are obviously not perfect, but better than anyone else’s right now. You can see aesthetic similarities in their deliveries: overhand, simple windup/step, usually high velocity with a “rising” fastball and power-curve (even in less-successful attempts like Ken Giles). Cole, for example, was studied for over a year before they made their move for him. Ryan Pressly was pretty much yanked out of obscurity by them, now one of the best relievers out there. It looks suspicious, but it’s just a really creative investment that’s been paying off for them recently.",baseball
"Lmao your post would make sense if this wasn't the fourth year of disappointment. And even then, the fact remains that he couldn't take a 106 win team further than the DS, against a team who had never made it further than the DS. These are not a couple of questionable decisions, Roberts has amply shown that he will never win you a WS.",baseball
"surprised you got upvoted for this. You're 100% correct, but some teams are starting to act. Look up your own COO Chris Giles' talk at MIT Sloan. Changing the entire way stadiums are built and ticketing works in order to attract younger fans. Young fans don't give a shit about baseball. They go to games to drink outdoors at a bar with friends, the game is just for atmosphere and background noise.  
    
The A's new stadium will capitalize on that. If baseball wants to survive, it needs to not be boring as hell. Three true outcomes is a huge issue. If you're under 30, try going to a game with friends/casual fans. They'll be bored and wanting to leave by the 6th, guarantee it.",baseball
"You're thinking of that pitching change in the context of when it was made in the game. Greinke has had a poor postseason. Tonight was the first time all postseason that he had pitched into the seventh. He shouldn't have. You have Cole and Osuna as the big weapons in the bullpens. It should've Greinke for five, Cole for three and then Osuna. Davey Martinez did exactly that tonight but only because Scherzer struggled just to get through five. I think if Scherzer was more efficient and got through seven, Corbin would've still been the first man out of the bullpen. Hinch got incredibly lucky that he got Greinke through six and that should've made the path to glory that much simpler and yet he fucked it up. I wasn't looking for Cole to pull off some MadBum-esque heroics but simply to do his job. He didn't even get that opportunity thanks to a misguided gamble and unforced errors mixed with some bad luck.",baseball
"How about none of them are bad?

I never understood why people care so much about fans staying until the end of the game.  They just saw their team choke up a lead and give up a Grand Slam in the 9th inning.  They were pissed off and probably wanted nothing to do with it anymore.  If the Dodgers made a historic come back in the bottom of the 9th I'm sure they would hate themselves for leaving but they aren't probably of the clearest mind and are acting out on rage.  I'm sure we have all been there as sports fans.

As for the Braves booing?  This I obviously have no problem with.  I boo crappy performances from my team all the time.",baseball
"The Astros, having lost to the Devil Magic in 2004 (Jim Edmonds NLCS game 6), are one of the few teams to defeat the Devil Magic (Giants Devil Magic immunity notwithstanding) the following year.  Tho, the DM came hard for them, and Brad Lidge (2005 NLCS game 5), they were able to overcome.  I look forward to the NLC World Series.  Houston vs. Devil Magic, one final showdown.  Roger Clemens throws out the first pitch.  Carlos Beltran somehow named Astros manager midway thru game 3, only to be replaced after game 5.  Albert Pujols spotted pounding toquitos like a mad man on the tracks above the Crawford Boxes.  And David Eckstein, disguised as an umpire fields the ball and makes the final out, but dies having to put his entire body into the throw from near the second base bag.",baseball
"The facts? The fact is you cant determine that he was referencing domestic violence because he screamed “Im so fucking glad we got Osuna”, regardless of who it was allegedly directed at. You can extrapolate from his words all you want, but just because multiple witnesses heard him mention Osuna, does not mean he was referencing domestic violence.",baseball
"You assume I supported the decision to even allow him on the Yankees in the first place. I did not. But then again, we aren't talking about the Yankees. We are talking about this. It's not a game of ""well what about"" although as you can see it is very easy to play.",baseball
"No. And it has nothing to do with the player that’s gone. See 2001 Mariners for an example of when stars leave. Or see the 2019 Red Sox for an example of when stars stay. Sometimes a change is needed or a specific player to have a career year. This is baseball. 

Unfortunately for Harper, it looks bad for him. And on top of that, the Phillies didn’t improve even will all that payroll added. Side note, I expect the Phils to add someone like Porcello. 3rd starter with upside.",baseball
"I’ve softened a bit on this. He seems like a guy with an addiction of his own whose illness drove him to do irresponsible things. My brother once forged hundreds of dollars in checks on my account. When they went through, I went to the bank, requested copies of the checks, recognized the handwriting and realized I could not pursue this further. I couldn’t sent my brother to federal prison. What he needed was help.

I wish Kay the best. He may not work in the game again, but what’s important is his health.",baseball
"Pedro was laughing when he said it though - he was clearly joking around. The guy played with *Manny fucking Ramirez*, you don't think he thought that kind of thing was funny?

edit: for the record, yes Pedro *100%* would've hit Soto, but he's also joking around. The phrase ""Soto laughed it off"" sounds like Pedro was being a dick, when it was just 2 guys kidding around",baseball
"Wasn’t exactly a true debut, but I was at Tony Gonsolin’s home debut back in August. I got a real good catcher-angle view of him from where I was sitting, and since he was absolutely dealing that night, I’ll tell you that his splitter was so nasty, which made watching Cards hitters flail at it a lot of fun. I’m really excited for his future with the team!",baseball
"You really have to have a better understanding of the game than the average American to not view it as a boring game. You’d be hard pressed to find someone who doesn’t understand the basics of the game: guy pitches, other guy tries to hit it. If there’s no contact made and the ball isn’t put into play, it’s a boring 30-45 seconds of nothing happening and people quickly lose interest. 

So when compared to football or basketball where something is nearly always happening, guys running around and the ball going all over the place, it’s easy to see why it’s considered boring.",baseball
"Again, if one team gets to hypothetically be healthy all year, then it is only fair to give that same consideration to all 30 simultaneously, and then the differences are likely not so big as 10 wins.

But to entertain your thought anyway, Snell started 23 games and was worth 1.4 bWAR. Projected out to 30 games, this is basically 0.4 more WAR. 

Glasnow was worth 2.6 WAR in 12 starts. Projected to 30 starts, this is an additional 3.9 WAR.

So the projection is that, in the unfair situation where the Rays and only the Rays get to have uninjured aces, they win an additional 4.3 games. Not 10.",baseball
"With the Astros reaching the ALCS for a third consecutive season, every year of the 2010s has had a team in a stretch of playing in a League Championship Series three or more seasons in a row. 

2010: Phillies (2008-2010)

2011: Cardinals (2011-2014), Tigers (2011-2013)

2012: Cardinals, Tigers

2013: Cardinals, Tigers

2014: Cardinals

2015: Cubs (2015-2017)

2016: Cubs, Dodgers (2016-2018)

2017: Dodgers, Astros

2018: Dodgers, Astros

2019: Astros",baseball
"Wait. You’re telling me that my inverting my hat into a rally cap and not sitting was not the principle factor in the comeback against Milwaukee in the Wild Card? It’s just a dumb, silly, and fun superstition/tradition that helps keep fans invested in the game? [That can’t be true](https://giphy.com/gifs/anchorman-lies-lie-EouEzI5bBR8uk)",baseball
"Called 100% of the time, just doesn't come into play much.  They teach from little league on up:

1. Run in the runners lane, that's why it's painted in the first place. 
2. Throw that shit at the runner if he is in your way and hope they call interference. 

Inexcusable for a guy like Turner whose game is speed and beating out slow choppers to not know this is a thing and run in the correct lane.",baseball
"This is the big thing. Once the snap took so long, Pats knew there was a high likelihood of pass to save time. Seahawks needed to be more prepared for the scenario where there's no Pats timeout (i.e. be ready with hurry-up to keep their playbook open for run or pass), but that's easy to say in retrospect. It's counterintuitive to hurry-up when you're opponent is considering calling a timeout, but it may have been necessary at the time.",baseball
"Yeah, you're right, the announcers weren't totally cued on to Goldy, for one, trying to slap hits down the first base line.... Oh wait, yes they were, and they even talked about it...

When it's clear a hitter is trying to do something in particular with a hit, and then does it, that's execution.  You don't piss away someone's effort and execution by saying it's luck.

Either way, good series.",baseball
"He himself describes putting his first couple wives “through hell,” admits to having had multiple extramarital affairs, dealt with severe clinical depression, and was quite the alcoholic for a while. He’s also punched a conspiracy theorist whom arranged to meet buzz on false pretenses before insisting the moon landing was fake. To my knowledge, though, he’s not been accused of domestic violence by a member of his family.",baseball

"So, let me get this straight:  every team that tanks for a few years emerges as a World Series winner and 4 straight playoff appearances?  

So when do I wager on the Tigers, White Sox, Marlins, Reds, Padres and Mariners?

"Blue Jays fan here

To keep both JD Marty and Mookie Betts

- Backload the contract so their salary increase when Chris Sale and David Price's contract expire

- Mookie and JD should also accept that they should give Red Sox a bit of a discount ( The boys won't be crying a river if they are earning 100M instead of 102M ) If they are unnecessarily and unreasonably concerned with earning as much as possible, then it is also highly likely that they are only concerned with money, and they won't be as effective on the field as they were up until 2019.  Keep in mind that Manny Machado's OPS went down by more than .100 this year 

- And it was mentioned before but Red Sox probably can find a much lower priced replacement for JD Marty, a slugger whose sole responsibility is to generate offence.  Those kind of sluggers kinda can be found without much difficulty in the FA market or trade market

I keep on reading John Henry has $2.7B well then I don't question he does but I think Henry is trying to stay under luxury tax just like NYY has been trying to stay under it for the past several years",baseball
"Nah teams are cheap. Harper is worth every penny of that contract. 26 year old free agents that have had the best hitting season since Barry Bonds don't come around very often. 

He put up 4.2 war in a bag season where he was unlucky at the plate. Watch him ops over 1.000 next year and put up 6+ war. The guys a stud when healthy and this last year is his floor.",baseball
"The math is based on probability before to after.  If a team was still the favorite to win, it isn't possible to add as much.  


For Carter's, it was Game 6 so even if they lost they still had a decent shot at winning the WS the next game.  Plus, with 2 on and 1 out, there's a good chance they get the tying run in so that's already baked into the probability to a degree before he hits it.  The formula puts them at 71% chance of winning the WS by then, so his homerun only had 29% possible probability that could be added.  


For Gonzalez's, it was a tie game, guys on 1st and 3rd, 1 out.  They were given an 85% chance of winning the game and therefore the WS by the time he got to the plate, so he could only add so much.  Womack's hit to put them in that position is 2nd on the list though for tying it up and putting the winning run on 3rd, which added 49% to their probability of victory.",baseball
"Nope. You’re the flavor of the month because the organization and fan base continually try to make light of the situation. If everyone would just accept that domestic violence is a big deal and stop defending idiots like Taubman and Osuna then people would move on rather quickly. 

I’m not saying Osuna shouldn’t get to play. He didn’t have his day in court and we can’t definitely say what happened one way or another so by my standards of innocent until proven guilty he’s clear to play.

However the Astros have indefinitely condemned themselves with how the entire organization has acted about this.",baseball
"I am all for these guys receiving a harsh punishment, but it is a complicated issue I'm in not sure one strike and you're out makes sense.  One reason for that is that the person being abused often relies on the money the abuser makes playing baseball.  They may even have a kid with one of these abusive players.  In that case the victim needs to make the choice of whether they want their child to grow up incredibly wealthy or if they want to continue to allow this asshole to abuse them.

Dejong needs to make some adjustments, though.  He was just god awful in the 2nd half of the year after a very hot start.  He hit a bunch of homers but is he sacrificing too much for that?  His defense is good so there is room to grow.

Bader and Wong are definitely great pieces to build with but we just need to get some consistency somewhere.",baseball

"I’m in favor of the Astros releasing osuna, so keep that in mind when you read this...
He got suspended in accordance with the MLB policy and was therefore punished for his actions to the extent that MLB deemed fair. Now, if his girlfriend had decided to pursue legal action and he went to court and all that, that would be even better. However, MLB has already decided that they are okay with domestic abusers in their league as long as they serve an 80 game suspension or whatever. So it’s really not the Astros making this decision, it’s MLB. The Yankees have multiple domestic abusers on their roster. Not to mention that during the ALCS, the fox sports announcers lamented that German wasn’t able to pitch. Everyone is complicit, but taubman was stupidly brazen about his pride in that complicity, that’s why the Astros are a lightning rod for it right now.",baseball
"The Rays. I think teams like the Yankees and Dodgers who make it every year, almost, are not dealing with the same pressure to win as a small market franchise who has a much smaller window to win. If you’re a Rays player this may be the only time in the next 10 years that you can play in October. If you’re on the Dodgers you’ll be there next year. 

If I’m sitting in the Rays clubhouse part of me is thinking “this is our shot. I may not get another while I’m here.” That type of individual pressure is far heavier than the media.

Tack on the very real possibility of relocation, potentially saving a franchise, and you have a different level of pressure at the management level.",baseball

"So does the current model do this?  Adjust for, say, Altuve’s strike zone vs. Judge’s on the fly?  Are the radar guns actually redefining the top and bottom of the zone for each and every batter depending on height and batting stance?  How do the radar guns adjust themselves and then reliably recalibrate themselves without any human guidance?

There’s no way the system can actually visually detect someone’s knee vs. their armpit.  Yeah, we have facial recognition, but we’re decades away from that sort of technology.  Even if we had it, somehow that system would then have to map them in three dimensions and then send all that information to the radar guns for them to make micro adjustments without losing calibration.

I mean, he's one of the first five to walk into the Hall of Fame, along with Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Christy Mathewson and Honus Wagner. Even Cy Young, Pete Alexander, Lefty Grove took 2, 3, 4 years to get in, respectively. Ty Cobb, greatest hitter for average in that era hit for .366, but batted only .233 against Johnson. He would have finished with .368 average if it was not for the White Knight. It was embarrassing for Ty Cobb because Walter Johnson was a decent hitter as well with .235 career average, but Cobb hit even lower than what Walter hit against other pitchers.",baseball

"I don't think that would matter anyway.

The purpose of this rule, in my understanding, is to give the defense a chance at making the out. The runner is supposed to run in foul territory so he's not blocking the catcher's sightline to 1B, therefore forcing the catcher to move further infield in order to make the throw.

The runner being out of position can affect the play even if the ball doesn't smack him in the ass until he's next to the plate.",baseball
"No. The rule says you can move back out of the lane to touch the base if you were in the lane prior. It says if you were out of the lane prior though, you basically forfeit that right.

"Completely understandable. I stated earlier that I went pretty far in baseball and played with a few great players and that we were all extremely fortunate with the people we had in our lives to makes that happen. 

However, when you have a sport like baseball you have to practice ALL THE TIME because how skill demanding it is. Its not a sport you can really play easily by yourself (basketball and soccer), train really hard for and get incredibly fit (football, soccer, track), or go to a place to train and get skills relatively easy by yourself (hockey, tennis). I also played basketball and football so I’m in no ways shitting on those, but those are more accessible to practice/train for alone. 

Like he said, hitting by yourself is not only hard but can be counter productive since you are trying to throw a ball up and your mechanics suffer from trying to hit it too quickly. Pitching without someone catching, calling pitches, moving targets, etc can be somewhat beneficial but in the end you need experience in live reps. It’s something that you definitely need a ton of help. Having a team is great but you are expected to practice multiple hours per day outside of practice. Baseball practice is usually going over strategy, fielding, live batting practice and everything else you can’t just do with a parent at your local park. Also, having parents to take you to 50-70 games a year is super tough, assuming he had a single mother who also worked. 

I’m sure many people here and in other, less fortunate countries go through similar stuff Pham did and are amazed they got where they are so they point their credit outward, when, in the end they were ultimately the one that put in the work to do it. I just like that he is able to recognize how much work he put in and not deflect (which again can be very good.

"Closest I can think is the 2017 ALDS between Yankees and Indians. 

That Indians team was a World Series favorite with a dominant pitching rotation and at one point won 22 straight in the regular season as the all time record. They won 102 games that year to rebound from losing game 7 of the 2016 World Series. 

Conversely, the 2017 Yankees were a surprise team that won their wildcard match to face the powerhouse Indians as a team no one thought would compete that year in a rebuild, but ended up winning 91 games. 

The Indians won the first two games to go up 2-0 with home field. They then lost games 3 and 4 at Yankee Stadium and game 5 in Cleveland with Kluber pitching in a Cy caliber year for him.

"The strike zone, ump by ump, is itself subjective. 

Catchers glove movements influence (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively) strike calls. A catchers glove movement will often be called a ball even if it was a strike the whole time for perceived glove movement.

Pitchers, by reputation, are given different strike zones at times. Kershaw puts a breaking ball low, he’s more likely to get that call than a rookie with no reputation or history of those kinds of pitches.

I'm saying that as someone who hates the Yankees and is a fan of an AL East team, I hate that Torres will hurt us for many years to come.",baseball
"The team hasn't tried to buy great in many years, though. It's why all the anti-Yankee circlejerk is so bizarre. The team of today isn't the Yankees dynasty from the 90s that everybody still hates. They're just a good, fun, young, and likeable team trying their best under a bizarrely cheap ownership that values ticket sales over titles. If they wore any other uniforms, people would love them.",baseball
"Obligatory fuck the astros, but you seem like a pretty swell guy ;)

The mods are just taking the lazy “appease Reddit’s advertisers approach”. But I don’t get it... who in their right mind spends their free time censoring speech so that Reddit can make money from vanilla ad placements?

Honestly I figured my comment had already been shadow removed until you replied.",baseball
"I think my concern would be that it would make it more robotic, take some of the passion, interest and investment in the game out of it.  But don't get me wrong, I don't have an actual solid reason not to, just how I grew up watching the game, so what I'm comfortable with.  But if that's what people want and it works, I wouldn't throw a huge fit.  I'm just an old(er) man lol.",baseball
"I read the article! Don’t agree with it. I didn’t assume my culture should dictate anything. The person he meant to offend was offended. His actions were objectively trying to big dog Yu with a derogatory reference to his race. This is a bad take. Xenophobic, racist, and patronizing? Sick reach, bro.",baseball
"Just an idea I'm shitting out:

Well regarded guy, seemed like a good clubhouse presence based on stories of former teammates and was considered a bright hitter if I remember; something more like smart and a tape monster, unless I'm confusing him with someone else.

I don't know how serious they are, but a guy with good leadership qualities and a good work ethic while not being too old or tenured to reject FO orders.",baseball
"Way to crop my sentence haha. ""Every player has flucuations during seasons, and sometimes Carp has big fluctuations."" That doesn't mean he's inconsistent though. He had ONE season, 2018, with wild monthly splits, but other than that he's been very consistent month to month and he's always been consistent year to year.",baseball

"Why is Oakland a perpetual clusterfuck for MLB and NFL?  Is it all about that stadium and its' sticky tangled web?

The teams are all ready to take off, might as well nuke the entire site from orbit.  Something they should have already done long ago.  But there always seems to be more than one of [these fuckers around.](https://i.imgur.com/wn1HAc4.jpg)",baseball
"So I don't usually watch baseball but figured I'd watch the WS. How accurate is that superimposed strike zone? Seems like there's a bunch of pitches inside  it called balls, and a bunch outside it called strikes. Is it not very accurate, or are umpires just as terrible as they are in every other sport?",baseball
And then there will be complains about the system not being perfect. There will always be someone complaining what happens if one of the cameras were to malfunction? What happens if the radars return faulty data. Yes I know tech fails airplanes crash hell space shuttles crash. Who is responsible to check the integrity of the data being returned. It's a great system to analyze players but to decide actual ball games based on a computer system there are a lot of kinks to be worked out. What happens if the cameras stop working during a ball game do we then revert to human umpires? Are they susceptible to people in the  crowd with signal jammers? Even the Pentagon got hacked so who is in charge of making sure statcast or said computer is not hacked? Are those employees free of biases? There are a myriad of questions to be answered. I would rather live with a few inches error of the strike zone.,baseball
"Not sure why you got downvoted for this haha, I've been doing this for the playoffs for years. You've just got to make sure you go somewhere with a lot of TVs if the local NFL team is on at the same time.

edit: oh, OP said they want to host a couple times. Still a good option though!",baseball
"If you are going to make a call outside the zone you better call that a strike every time.  Consistency that's the name of the game.  Still, the ump's union can go suck it with the strike zone put complaints.  You aren't perfect but you can't fuck up like this in a World Series game.",baseball
"The whole state seems to have a knack for it, and it always feels about the same. All we gotta do is run the ball, kill some clock, and the game’s over. As long as we avoid penalties we’re still in field goal ra- wait what the fuck is Luke Jackson doing on the field",baseball
The simple reason why that is a thing is that historically strikeouts didn't exist. You'd get 3 tries to hit the ball. If you didn't you'd just get to run to first. Eventually strikeouts became a way to shorten the process so that catchers didn't have to throw to first on every strike three since it was basically a guaranteed out anyway. They just left the rule that you could try to run to first if the catcher misses the third strike (and if there's no one on first or there's two outs.... This part is to prevent an intentional cheap double play),baseball
"Not saying this to take away from what CC did, but a separated shoulder is an injury to the AC joint, the ligaments that hold the collarbone to the shoulder blade. A shoulder subluxation is a partial dislocation where it slides partially out of place then slides back in, and is an injury to the labrum. 

Still very impressive that he pitched through it, I lost so much arm strength when I had the same injury",baseball
"I love this comment as well from that thread:

&gt; The Pirates are known and renowned for their skill in handling pitchers particularly. I doubt the Astros have some magic want to fix Cole that the Pirates somehow missed. The Astros may have the better baseball ops department, but the Pirates specialize in fixing pitchers! You’re kidding yourself

BTW this was him defending his assessment that Musgrove is better than Cole",baseball
"The Tigers went to the postseason year after year with a dominant rotation and a shaky bullpen, and the bullpen shit the bed year after year. If Davey Martinez had been our manager back then, I think we’d have a ring or two. (Would I have mocked anybody who said this five months ago? Definitely!)",baseball
"Pffft your team had a disapoiting year because you missed the fucking playoffs, what are you stupid? Twins won the division, and regardless of what happens to the Twins in the postseason, that will always be better than missing out on the postseason entirely. Are you even listening to yourself? You're clearly trying to find ways to cope with your disappointing team. Twins were not expected to even compete this year, let alone winning the division. They have already exceeded every Twins fan's expectations, and now their window is wide open. Unless Cleveland actually makes some moves to compete for the division this upcoming season, Twins will win it again. You want to talk about deluding yourself? You're the one ***desperately*** trying to convince yourself that having winning records against those teams but *missing* the playoffs is actually better than winning the division and actually getting to play in October. What kind of fantasy world do you live in?",baseball
"Who tf is the other dude who came even close to Acuña in this series? Guy had like a .600 OBP hitting leadoff and the only run he scored was when he homered himself in.

I guess maybe Soroka but he only got one start so tough to say he was as good as Acuña.",baseball
"I mean when you dig deep into the analytics, the Cards were one of the worst teams to make the playoffs. Horrible offense, mediocre bullpen, decent starting pitching, but all offset by the fact they play in the worst division in the NL.

It was a miracle they beat the Braves",baseball
"I always have hated IPAs. Nice to see I'm not alone(though sometimes looking on the Untappd app I too often feel like I'm one of the few thinking this way), in thinking IPAs are way the heck overrated. And to me, not sure why but I don't care for them myself.",baseball
"Jack Morris threw 10 shutout innings against the Braves in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series. He did allow 9 base runners though so idk if it counts as “dominant”

Edit:

Others:

- 1985 Bret Saberhagen threw a 5 hit shutout against the Cardinals, but only 2 K

- 1965 Sandy Koufax threw a 3 hit shutout with 10 K against the Twins

- 1962 Ralph Terry threw a 4 hit shutout in a 1-0 win for the Yankees",baseball
"I got sort of burnt out on baseball years and years ago and barely know any of the players anymore. One thing my mind still can't fully accept is the Astros being in the AL and playing some of the most lethal baseball on either side of an inning.

Like I still just imagine this little club in an underpowered NL where their ace is Wandy Rodriguez and their best player is an old-ass Lance Berkman. I'm so out of touch.",baseball
"I was aaaaaalmost off the ""I hate Joe Buck"" bandwagon because the general consensus has been coming around that he's not asssssss bad as he used to be. And he's definitely not. ""Mitchel. Mitchel. Mitchel....""

But then I was driving during Thursday Night Football during the Chiefs Broncos game and oh my god this dude is impossible to listen to if you're not already watching the game with complete understanding of what is happening. Like he does not make the game any better and in fact I argue he makes it worse by making you, the fan, fill in all the blanks. 

Beat example I can give is this, 

""He's got it. Fading back to pass....he throws. It's bobbled.....but he crosses the 50 and is down at the 48."" 

I turn to my wife who's watching it while I'm driving and I'm like, ""Babe was that just a 30-40 yard pass?"" And she's confirms it was.

It's that over and over again all broadcast long. No useful information. Just terrible and I just turned the game off rather than listen to him. 

In baseball he's fine cause he can just read the stat sheet they give him for each inning. And you and I could play by play call an at-bat.",baseball
"Could someone explain to me the rules on how pitchers can be used? So is there a rule that says Cole can’t pitch two games in a row? Or is it just because he’s be too tired after pitching a game? Forgive the ignorance, English fan trying to get my head around the rules. Thanks",baseball
"1. Cards-Yanks WS would be so awesome (even though the chances of that are looking pretty slim lol)
2. Nobody will ever catch the Yankees in my lifetime, so I'd rather they get another than another team creep up on us
3. Is there any team more obnoxious than the Astros? And yes, I realize that most people will say the Cardinals",baseball
"Right. He ran the same lane that 9/10 runners go for. And the other 1/10 are even more inside on the grass. 

If the throw is remotely on target, the 1B is fielding the ball with his glove towards the pitchers mound and the runner would be out 9/10 times. 

A bad throw shouldn’t penalize the runner.",baseball
"It always blows me away how sports leages dont archive their footage better. 

Like, even games as recent as this. 

Daniel Alfredsson won the Calder trophy for best rookie in the NHL in 1996, and there is like ZERO good footage of any of his games or highlights that can be found easily, if it all. That's just my personal frustration. It's like, I would buy a DVD set of that season, just for that reason, but leagues dont do that shit.",baseball
"I'm still so shocked. The interference clearly happened on the last step. The runner is allowed to be inside the baseline on his last step as long as he's going to the base.

Yes, he was inside the line the entire way, and if the ball or fielder would have hit him at any point in the first 85 feet of the baseline, it would have been a proper call. But it didn't.",baseball
"Everyone's mad because no one reads the rules, so here it is.

5.09(a)(11) [Batter's out if]  In running the last half of the distance from home base to first base, while the ball is being fielded to first base, he runs outside (to the right of ) the three-foot line, or inside (to the left of ) the foul line, and in the umpire’s judgment in so doing interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first base, in which case the ball is dead; except that he may run outside (to the right of ) the three-foot line or inside (to the left of ) the foul line to avoid a fielder attempting to field a batted ball",baseball
The rule literally is the runner has to run in that 3 foot wide lane in foul territory. Running in fair territory on a ball thrown from around the catcher that affects the play being made is always interference. I get it fucked the Nats (the boom HR) but it's the right call based off the rules,baseball
"Wait, two cities don't occupy the same physical space? Holy shit, my entire worldview has been massively altered. All this time I thought I lived in Albany, NY and London, U.K. at the same time. 

Oh no wait, I didn't think that, hence the question about climate differences. Ya fuckin jackass.",baseball
"I don't agree with the notion that it was a smart aggressive play. Brantley sold out late on the dive. Judge should've been thinking 2nd with an eye on 3rd, but he was thinking of scoring. He shouldn't have  been beyond the halfway point between 1st and 2nd, which still could've afforded him 3rd on a missed dive and possibly even home anyways. That was dumb aggressive.",baseball
"There are a lot of rights we have, but we know to use our discretion not to exercise them. And did Freeman call anyone else out? McCann calling for breaking balls from Melancon on 0-2 pitches when the Cards were either hitting them or watching them leave the zone? Markakis for getting caught napping and failing to get the ball to the infield in time to stop Fowler from advancing in the ninth? Or what about the entire team going *1 for 11* with RISP? No.

Sure, he can call out whoever he wants. But he can have the private convo with his teammate; instead he decides to call out a teammate who had an otherwise good game to the media, a kid who went 3-4 with a walk and two XBH (7 total bases, the most in the Braves and Cardinals lineup), including a clutch HR in the ninth. It just seems unfair to me to call him out for that play. Just say there were a lot of things that could be done differently (""Yeah, that is frustrating, but he had an otherwise great game, and we as a team ultimately lost it.""). Complaining to the press does nothing to pick up your teammate and risks creating the feeling that you're throwing someone under the bus.

Maybe Freeman and McCann are the leaders of the team, but this isn't what good leaders do. Not saying they're bad leaders, but I don't think Freddie is in the right for calling out his teammate as he did in this particular instance.",baseball
"You’re saying this didn’t hurt them, when it very clearly did hurt them:  
  
1. Because it was more likely a double than a single.  
 
2. Because his hustle problems will continue to be an issue. It’s the fucking playoffs.  
  
I’m sorry but you’re pathetic. Stop gatekeeping a sport that’s existed for hundreds of years. Your opinion is dumb and wrong. Always hustle in the playoffs.",baseball
"Nope, Indians weren’t a better team. But frankly Twins have similar problems as the Indians. Twins owners don’t want to spend money on pitching, Indians don’t want to buy bats. Same outcome though: a team makes the playoffs that is not ready for the playoffs. It was the Indians last year. They were not good enough, made the playoffs because of lack of competition, got swept.",baseball

"That was certainly one of the best NL Wild Card games I’ve seen. Everything was looking all right for the Brewers, but that Bottom of the 8th. Man, it was like the Nats found new life and it was like a WS win for them. Feel bad for Milwaukee.

Now the Nats will have the pleasure to get beaten by the Dodgers (prove me wrong, Nats).",baseball
"I can’t disagree more with the people who are saying this is a bad game or a bad night for the sport or whatever. Controversial calls happen in every sport. Baseball’s just the only one that has been contemplating the implementation of “robot umpires” (for balls and strikes, as I understand it. Not for runner interference.), so this call is getting magnified under that particular lens right now.

But this has been a fantastic, instant classic game. The drama and intensity have been on point from the first pitch. And oh by the way look at Strasburg go. This has been an awesome night of baseball.",baseball
"The problem comes when the rule is not applied by the letter of the law, which in the course of a season, is often.  If it were always called in that exact manner, sure, good call.  It's not always called the same way though, which puts it squarely in the judgement call zone.  In this instance I would argue that the runner ran back into the lane before reaching first base and the throw was so far into said lane that it hit him.  It could then be argued that whether he ran in the lane or not the ball still would have hit him.",baseball
"I know we won in 2016 and that night was one of the best nights of my life as a sports fan seeing the Cubs win.  But as a 21 year old in 2003, the only time I've truly lost my s\*it was the Bartman game where I was basically crying frantically because I just KNEW we lost the game, even though it was 2-0 with 1 out.  My girlfriend at the time had no idea why I was so hysterical.  And that night still haunts me.

With all of that said, major MAJOR kudos to the Nationals tonight. A fragile team psyche like those '03 Cubs would have let tonight's terrible call destroy them. And instead, the Nats have put on 4 runs since then.

I can't give enough credit to that team for answering the bell.  Now finish it off so we can all go enjoy a Game 7",baseball
"Exactly. For example, if the call *was* overturned and turner was called safe, then *that* would be a misapplication of a rule against the Astros - whom could protest the game - due to the interference call being a 1) a judgement call and 2) non-reviewable. 

Reviewing and overturning a subjective, non-reviewable, non-overturnable call would be the misapplication of the rule.

*Supposedly* the only thing being reviewed by the umps were these rules themselves, not a review of the call itself. So all rules were followed tonight despite a bad judgement call.",baseball
"We're doing a bullpen game because Domingo German is a piece of garbage. 

A rotation of Tanaka-Paxton-Severino-German should've been more than enough for this team. The problem is that German isn't here and Severino is still in Spring Training mode. 

It's not Cashman or Steinbrenner's fault that Sevy missed the entire year, Paxton took 4-5 months to settle into a comfort zone, and Happ aged 10 years over night from 18 to 19. With our crazy good offense and bullpen, I had no concerns with the rotation assembled on paper.",baseball
"Technically Rainey would get the loss, but he should have never had to pitch a Scherzer start. Scherzer’s job is to go 6 or 7 innings and hide that weak part of the bullpen. I’m sure Max would be the first to admit he didn’t do his job tonight only going 5",baseball
"I think Zim himself knows that he’s not worth his option anymore, but he’s still worth a good sum to us, and I think he’d like to come back at a reduced rate. That said, even if he doesn’t, dude would have finished by breaking supposed curses (or at least memes) and bringing us to our first World Series. What a run, man. What a run.",baseball
"The Nationals are done for a very long time

Our window has closed. Sad that we wasted the talent that we had the last 7-8 years but that’s how it is.

This season so far is unraveling that Rizzo is an overrated hack and Martinez is a bottom tier manager, both of which I’ve been saying for years.

Anthony Rendon will be gone next year and this team will officially turn in to crap, and the only thing we can hope is if Soto magically returns to rookie form.

[-Sauce-](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nationals/comments/b8z5w7/the_nationals_are_done_for_a_very_long_time/)",baseball
"I'm happy for them as a long time Astros fan. Their journey reminds me a lot of the 2005 astros. Both started out pretty badly (15-30 for the 05 astros, 19-31 for this nationals team), but pulled off a season long comeback to go from underdog wildcard team to NL Champion. Oh, and they BEAT THE CARDINALS. Both went/are going to the World Series for the first time ever. Those times in mid October 2005 were such a great time to be an Astros fan, so I hope the nationals fans feel great.",baseball
"What a run for the Nats so far. Stun the Brewers late in the game, knock off the juggernaut Dodgers, and now completely dominate an overmatched Cardinals team. Astros get a lot of hype for their rotation but the Nats look just as good, if not better, with extremely clutch hitting.",baseball
"I'd like to think that the last two starts would convince Hal to act like his Dad for once, but I really don't think we offer more than 6 years.  That simply won't get it done.  Even if Stras hits the open market, we're not offering enough term more than likely.",baseball
"did anyone forget that he CHOKED his girlfriend then fired eight shots from a GUN?

Rather than giving this guy millions of dollars to throw a ball he should be in jail like the psychopath he is. I've been a Yankee fan my whole life but I'm very disappointed to see them acquire him. There are things bigger than the game and I cannot root for the Yankees if they condone this.

The Dodgers made a smart and ethical decision in passing him up. It hurts me to do, but I have thrown out all my Yankee gear and decided to become a Red Sox or Mets fan (whichever one does better this year)",baseball
"Son, I know this will get buried. But man, Yankee fans are some of the most fickle people. Watching this game right now with my dad and this dude is acting like a five year old girl complaining about everything that isn't a home run or a big strikeout. On here, some of you guys are out here talking about trade Stanton, Boone is overrated. I get some of you might be prisoners of the moment. But jesus man, what exactly can be done. Tip your hat to the Astros and get over yourselves.",baseball
"&gt;&gt; Management for Yanks did a good job conditioning a lot of fans.
&gt;
&gt;They have to be younger fans because my friends and I all over 30 have **been bitching about them not spending the kind of money we're used to them spending**. 
&gt;
&gt;**The Yankees buy championships. It's our thing, spend the fucking money**.

TY for being such a great fan. In contrast, the NHL is hard capped, so the leafs can't just buy talent and become the evil empire on ice. It sucks, look how long it's been since a cup. 

Id even argue that NYY needs to spend the money to keep fans, to keep that YES network dollars rolling in.  Then again, the knicks are still a thing and they havent been good in a long time.",baseball
"I've seen more bad Dodgers fans on Reddit than I have in person, and I live in SoCal. Most Dodgers fans I know are chill. They follow the Dodgers because they love baseball, and they learned about baseball through their parents; it's a family thing. It's *nice.* It's obviously a large fanbase and you're going to have your share of dicks, but at least dickishness hasn't been embraced as a cultural thing unlike *some* fan bases...",baseball
Got to love Hunter Pence. Amazing comeback. Went to the DR for winter ball and worked on his swing. The Giants let him walk when they had Connor Joe and Michael Reed as opening day OF. Glad he went to Texas and got his groove back. He's a ton of fun to watch play.,baseball
"Your punishment must be more severe. I will build you and Houston up with hope and then destroy you. Hope is really the key to torture. Houston will build to a point of joy and then be faded from the flairs. When the Juice Box is ashes, then you have my permission to die.",baseball
"I know exactly what he’s gonna say.

“As you guys know, our umpires work real hard throughout the year, real troopers out there. Sometimes things get rough but they always pull though. We really gotta applaud the good work they put in day in and day out. This has been a great World Series and it’s going to be an exciting last game.”

“Joe what about the call?”

“Okay we’re done taking questions, thank you all.”",baseball
"No matter what happened in that game, Steve Bartman was going to be relieved.

Cubs win?  Yay, no one cares about me any more.

Cubs lose?  Yay, they are going to hate Chapman and Maddon more than me now!

Note:  Bartman did not deserve ANY of the hate that went his way.",baseball
"A lot of that is hindsight, though. The narrative now is ""the mood changed,"" but I'm not sure that was the case in real time. If anything, most of the more paranoid fans were already nervous before the foul ball just because of the situation of trying to hold on to an important lead and having so many years of disappointing finishes.",baseball
"This is so revisionist. He allower 3 runners mostly by bad luck: a ""HBP"" that was actually a foul ball, a broken bat blooper, and a walk. Imagine he pulled Hader and the next dude (who would've been a worse pitcher than Hader) allowed that same hit. This sub would call Counsell the dumbest mfer ever",baseball
"If you think out star player was pulled a couple of days ago when it was two months ago then you’re an extremely casual fan. They asked no question, they stated something as if it was fact when it was far from true. Solid rant, though, considering what I said had literally zero to do with you.",baseball

Now, nobody seems to care.  

It's really sad.  

Oh how I wish Jack Kent Cooke's son would've been able to purchase the team.",baseball
"I’ve never fully understood it to be honest. I’ve accepted that everyone hates us but it seems like everyone has different reasons. For some it’s because of our fans (as if there aren’t crappy people in every fanbase) and for others it’s because we supposedly buy our championships even though like 20 of our 27 World Series wins came before the creation of free agency. 

We’re hardly the only team that spends money yet nobody seems to hate the Red Sox, Cubs, Dodgers, Giants, etc. in the same way they hate the Yankees. It doesn’t bother be so much as it just perplexes me. We’ve won one World Series this century and have tons of likable players but we still get tons of hate, so it is what it is at this point lol",baseball

Johnson and Schilling flatten the Yanks’ momentum in Games 1 and 2. Yankees grind out a 2-1 win and then two heroic walkoffs at the old Yankee Stadium, then the D-Backs crush them in Game 6 and chip away just enough to pull Game 7 out from the Yanks.",baseball

"The Nationals took advantage this game and didn't let it go. They struck tonight when they needed to, and the Astros simply didn't.

Yes, there were questionable strike/balls for both sides.

Yes, Hinch could've played his bullpen cards better, but let's be honest- he leaves Greinke in, and Zach gives up another run, everybody would be blaming Hinch for not taking Greinke out. I don't think you can fault him too much for that decision.
The Stros' bullpen really underperformed tonight.

Astros leaving double-digits men on base? 10 men left on base even though you've had 9 hits? Come on, you've **gotta** be better than that in Gm7 of the World Series.

Unbelievable job by Kendrick with incredibly clutch hits throughout the postseason, Strasburg was incredible this series, Scherzer put his body on the line and played balls-to-the-wall for a Game 7 start. Rendon is my personal MVP as he was clutch, time and time again, coming up with massive hits/homeruns when his team needed him the most.

Great series, very few complaints from a neutral fan (other than the fact that my team is now the only team not to play in a WS).

"Random thought:

 I like that the Nationals acknowledge the Senators history. I sometimes wish that MLB would do what the NFL did with the Ravens/Browns and work out a deal so the Nats can get the Senators history/records while the Twins and Rangers are treated as expansion teams and the Expos just become a defunct franchise. 

The Nats are an extension of DC's baseball history. No one in Texas or Minnesota ever gave two shits about the Washington Senators.",baseball

They will try to hype it up and make it seem like a big upset,  but it really isn’t. The Nats are very good. Their regular season record wasn’t that great because they had a very poor first 50 games. They really turned it on after that and got a wild card spot. Their rotation will have no problem matching Houston’s pitcher for pitcher.",baseball
"If he was further to the right he wouldn’t have knocked the glove off.. if he was further to the left it would have been a tackle. Look, the rule is simple. If you want to avoid interference, run inside the lane. One foot outside makes you eligible for interference. Turner was completely inside the infield line. He was kicking up dirt from the infield. It was not a borderline call at all. It was egregious. It was really bad base running that never got called for him because it’s not often you rip off a guys glove. He’s been making this mistake for months if not years if I had to guess. Be mad at your coaches for not catching it.

The rule is to give the catcher a clear line to throw to first and for safety at first. You want the runner toward the outside of the bag. Here he was towards the inside which is dangerous.",baseball
"This comment, and the game in general, got me interested. So i did a little research. Of guys with 10+ save Hader hadn't the 18th best save% at 84. Make it 15+ and he's in 15th. 

This might be a little skewed because he was asked to work multiple innings some times.

I think Vizquel has gotten a lot of love from voters because people think of him as another Ozzie Smith in terms of being a great defensive shortstop with no pop in his bat. The thing is Ozzie was a significantly better defensive AND offensive player than Vizquel. Smith had an eight year stretch from 1985-1992 when he was a basically league average offensive player at the plate (99 OPS+). Vizquel only had three seasons with an OPS+ that high. Ozzie was at 375 defensive runs above average for his career. Vizquel was at 262 defensive runs above average for his career. Smith was able to accumulate 46 rWAR from 1985-1992 which was a higher rWAR than Vizquel accumulated over his entire career. Just because the two had a similar playing style doesn't mean they were anywhere in the same ballpark as players but apparently a lot of these BBWAA writers think that way.,baseball

"I was just about to make this thread. This shit is unwatchable. If matchup bullpenning is going to remain a strategy in baseball, then a pitching change should be close to instant, like in basketball and football where you quickly sub in players. They don't need 8 warmup pitches on the mound. The manager doesn't need to come out to the mound and give the pitcher a pat on the ass. 

This thread will get downvoted, but you can bet there will be an article about this tomorrow, connecting it to the ""baseball is dying"" myth. And one of the reasons I want chickenshit Manfred to do something because I care about the health of the game and get tired of articles like that existing.

A 9 inning game with typical offense game shouldn't last over 3 hours, but when teams like the Yankees and Rays play, 3.5 hour 9 inning games aren't uncommon.",baseball

Hopefully Boone has better bullpen management for game 3. At least having a day off isn’t going to hurt anyone’s availability too much.",baseball
Those two things are one and the same. Simply running out of the lane doesn't get you called out. Running in the lane and hitting the first baseman doesn't get you called out. Hitting the first baseman while he's trying to make a play on the throw while you are running out of the lane gets you called out.,baseball
"Then explain why Altuve wasn't out here?

(because he didn't interfere right)

https://i.imgur.com/AKDn9Fl.png

Now, The problem was the THROW, not the interference.

When you throw the ball AT THE RUNNER obviously he's gonna get hit. Therefore the interference never would have happened if te ball wasn't going directly at the runner.

It's not interference, it's a bad throw and a runner should absolutely not be punished for a bad throw.

/thread",baseball
"MLB interpretation is as follows:

If the runner is coming from within the lane, he is protected his last step. If the runner is coming from out of the lane, he is not. In this case, he was not running in the lane, so he was not protected in his last step.

However, if he was in the lane until that last step, this would not be considered running lane interference.

Additionally, the rule you quoted states ""permitted to exit."" He was never in the lane, so he cannot exit. 

Who cares what Donaldson thinks? Players/coaches/announcers have shown time and time again they are clueless about the rules. 

I am an NCAA umpire, so I would think I know the rule pretty well. The differences are minor between NCAA and OBR.",baseball
"It's really not that rare of a call. You can go to YouTube and search for ""runners lane interference"" and find tons of examples, including ones where the throw was shitty. For example: https://youtu.be/oZ9i2UOBMkI

"Stras would be on full rest in Game 5.  

Corbin I'd assume would be spelled by Sanchez if needed, but only a day short and right after getting extra time at the end of the year.

"&gt;That's why pitchers have different pitches and combinations, to mess with a batter's expectations of where the ball is going to go. You don't need to have strikes outside the strike zone for that to happen.

Exactly! That was a huge part of my game as a pitcher. But then you ran into umps that wouldn't give you strikes because they interpreted the approach as a lack of control. Meanwhile a pitcher that throws consistent stuff (for whatever reason) often gets inches off the plate. If some of those pitchers had to bring that stuff on the plate they'd get hammered.",baseball

DC is the worst city I’ve driven in, though and I’d never willingly do it again.",baseball
Hader didn’t pitch well but he gave up a broken bat blooper and a routine base hit. It’s not like they were teeing off against him. Of course the HBP and walk hurt too but they should have come out with at least a tie game. The playoffs are also when performances are more volatile.,baseball
"Our window has closed. Sad that we wasted the talent that we had the last 7-8 years but that’s how it is.

As for Osuna, his GF left the country and refused to come back to testify so the Canadian government punished him as best they could by ordering a restraining order

In both cases it should be pointed out that testifying in a normal situation is hard enough, but add to that the fact that these men are wealthy celebrities which not only means better lawyers it also means the women would be giving up the lifestyle and financial security they're accustomed to which some aren't willing to do",baseball

"The umpire judged the runner to be out of the lane, therefore interference. 

The runner must run the last half between HP and 1B within the 3’ runners lane. He can leave the lane within the vicinity of the base in an attempt to step on the base. In this case, he ran in fair territory, outside of the base and because a catchable throw hit him, he is out and all runners return to their bases at the time of pitch. He is not protected on his last steps in this case because he didn’t run legally the whole way before being hit. If he was in the lane and then was hit by the throw where he did get hit, he’d likely be safe and no call would have been made.",baseball
"Overall an opener isn't a bad idea, but I don't think that's the way itll go for 2 reasons:

-*Corbin himself* has been floated as a guy who needs an opener. He often struggles early getting his stuff set up properly, but settles in nicely. 

-If you don't know how many innings you're getting out of Max, then you don't want to use guys that can do long relief early if possible. If he has a spasm after 0.2 IP you don't want to have burned Corbin. Sanchez existing makes this better, but still. If they knew they'd get minimum 3 out of Max, it'd be great, but this just sets you up to burn Corbin and Max and be on the pen by the 5th, which is a loss.",baseball
"&gt; Is it just ANYTHING out of the ordinary is automatically assumed to be a show of cockiness

pretty much, yeah.

pitchers are allowed to scream and fist pump after getting strikeouts but if you hit a homerun and watch it for 2 seconds too long, there's a solid chance you're getting a fastball thrown at you during your next plate appearance...which is OK?

i love baseball but the sport has a ton of traditions that are just stupid. displaying literally any emotion after hitting a dinger is something that is frowned upon. it's dumb.",baseball
"&gt; Because of where gurriel was on the bag and the location of the throw there was literally no way Turner could have got out of the way, even if he was in the three-foot lane.

The Bucs are among the least attended since they haven’t been to the playoffs since 2007. They haven’t had a lot of success.  (hard to be a Bucs fan)

20,000 for the Lightning is pretty good and representative of the area. Not everyone needs a stadium of 35,000. The last Rays stadium proposal only had about 28,000 seats (30,000 with SRO). While it’s not as much as Miami or Oakland’s proposal, it was a realistic estimate for the area.",baseball

"It’s insane, my dad gets these mason-jar sized scripts of painkillers for a surgery he has years ago. I walk into the kitchen and there’s just tubs of percs like M&amp;M’s.

"&gt;The team that wins the wild card game has to screw up its whole pitching rotation for the first round, a round in which they are already overmatched.

That incentivizes teams winning their division, which is what MLB wants.

And having the wild card keeps the end of the season exciting for more fanbases and rewards teams that have drafted well, developed well, and managed well, but would otherwise have gone home despite excellent regular seasons, by at least giving them an opportunity to advance in the postseason. The Rays and Athletics have done plenty of things right over the past few years but through no fault of their own were stuck in the same divisions as two absolute juggernauts, but this way they get a do-or-die chance - and 2014 showed us that anything can happen from there.",baseball

I wonder how its sounds when the president of baseball operations and the overseer of the umpires doesn't have a good grasp over a fairly simple rule like the runner's lane. He postgame statement was pretty disappointing. Literally the only way this can be interference is based on how he ran to first,baseball
"By the letter of the rule, every time a right handed batter hits an infield grounder their path to first base should start by running to the side to get to the area between the two lines, then turning and heading towards the spot to the right of first base, and then cutting left to hit the base in their last few strides. I shouldn't have to tell you that no one ever does this. IMO, that's because most umps acknowledge that the spirit of this rule wasn't intended to bail fielders out for bad defense or create an unfair advantage for left-handed batters, and they use their judgement to not call interference in all but the most clear cut cases. If this rule was actually enforced this strictly in every case it'd totally change how the game is played. Right-handed batters would have to either put themselves at a huge disadvantage compared to lefties altering their route to first, or they'd have to keep running an ""illegal"" line while knowing the defense's best play is to have the 1B set up with his glove in the base path so the fielder can peg it at the runner's back and get the interference call.

This call was the baseball equivalent to a cop pulling you over for going 1 MPH over the speed limit. Everybody does it, and by the letter of the law it's illegal, but it's so universally ignored that if a cop actually gave you a ticket for going 1 MPH over the speed limit you'd assume he's either a massive asshole or he has it out for you.",baseball

To me arguing that this should be a ball is like arguing that a ball that went out in tennis should have been called in. I don't see how umpires missing the call makes the sport better. It just takes the outcomes out of the players hands and opens the sport up to corruption.,baseball
"Yeeeah I’m not gonna bother with this. Babe Ruth is considered the best because he reshaped baseball with his play and brought the sport into the limelight. Most of our modern contemporaries wouldn’t exist or be the same if it weren’t for Ruth. He also was an elite pitcher before becoming an inner circle hitter.


I also wanna mention that I hate the whole “dominating across eras” argument that are used in a lot of these debates because it inherently has a huge bias against players from older eras. Of course modern players would sweep the floor with older leagues with how they are today. That’s how the evolution of a sport and its external influences work. Modern players have the history of baseball techniques, results, and other things like sports medicine and technology on their side. Older players have much less to work with having played with less of that history to consult. Either way, it’s all based on hypotheticals we cannot test. We don’t know if Babe Ruth would put up the same numbers had he been born into this era and raised the same as modern players were. We don’t know if Mike Trout would put up the same numbers had he been born a century earlier and only had the technology at the time to deal with. And there’s no way of knowing.",baseball

"From what I've seen -- and my main observation of Kershaw was in the World Series last year -- some of it is just bad luck. Kershaw was pretty good in Game Five of the World Series last year, but David Price was so much better that the four runs Kershaw allowed was an insurmountable lead. 

If you look at the stats, he does have plenty of well-pitched postseason games. His record is 9-11. Just last year he pitched eight shutout innings against the Braves in the NLDS. 

Based on the [Clayton Kershaw Postseason Chokes](https://youtu.be/abFZM-2TidI) video, it looks he has a major case of Pedro Martinez Syndrome and should never be allowed to throw more than 100 pitches in a game. More broadly, he seems to lose his command, but not his control -- his pitches stay in the zone, but not where he wants them to go. I've read that he's a perfectionist, so it makes me think that rather than trusting his stuff he keeps trying to spot his pitches perfectly in high-pressure situations.

It's also worth noting that Kershaw is hardly the only prominent pitcher to dominate in the regular season and seem to fall apart in the post-season. Roger Clemens went 13 years between his first and second post-season wins, David Price I mentioned. Hell, look at Scherzer this year.",baseball
"As a former travel ball coach, I could always deal with umpires missing close calls on the bases, and I rarely expect strike zones to be good at lower levels. What I couldn't deal with was when the umpires didn't know the rules. 

I got tossed twice in my illustrious coaching career. Once when I had an umpire call a balk on my pitcher (a lefty) because he stepped off and lifted his hand to show the runner on first the ball. He said ""it doesn't matter if you step off, you can't fake to first"". Blatantly incorrect. He was the ""crew chief"" that day so it his decision was final, despite the other umpire telling him he was wrong. I had coached the other team's head coaches son in the past, so we had a good relationship, and he even came out and told him that he didn't want the benefit of the balk because it wasn't the right call. The umpire threatened to suspend the game if I didn't leave and the other coach didn't get back in the coaches box. 

The other time came in the semi finals of a tournament game in the bottom of the last inning. The other team had the bases loaded, 2 outs, down 1 and it was an 0-2 count. Our pitcher throws an inside fastball and it hit the knob of the bat (still a terrible pitch) and you could audibly hear the ping. That batter didnt react at all as if he had been hit (it was a fastball from a kid throwing the hell out of the ball). The umpire called it a dead ball and the tying run came into score. Fortunately we wound up winning in extras. When I asked the umpire why it wasn't a foul ball he said ""it cant be a foul ball if the batter doesn't swing"". Absolutely inexcusable, so I had some choice words for him and didn't get to stick around to watch our win. 

Missed calls are one thing, but theres never an excuse to not know common rules of the game.",baseball
"To be fair, that's not really what the stat is trying to tell you. fWAR is using peripheral stats and is more about being a predictive stat that estimates a player's true talent level. bWAR looks more at results / runs allowed / etc, so it would be a better measure of what a player was ""worth"" in a given season and I don't even think Fangraphs people would argue with that.

5.4 fWAR means he *pitched like* a 5.4 win pitcher, but sequencing / getting batters out at the right time / etc can easily mean a pitcher's results are better or worse than that. The idea is more that if you went back in time and played the season over again, and that pitcher's talent level was exactly the same, he would be expected to be worth about 5.4 wins. 

That's the reason the bWAR leaders are almost always higher than the fWAR leaders; results are more susceptible to variance and sequencing than the underlying stats, so the best guy is generally going to be an outlier who overperformed his underlying stats, and bWAR will capture more of that. If you looked at the worst pitcher by bWAR it would probably be a more extreme negative number than the worst pitcher by fWAR too for the same reason.

TL;DR I look at fWAR if I'm looking forward (i.e. should a team trade for or sign a guy, how good is he likely to be the rest of the season, etc) but I would use bWAR all day if we're talking about awards or who actually *performed* the best in a given year.

A great example of this is 2012-13 Jake Arrieta (this is random, but I'm an O's fan). His fWAR in 2012 combined with 2013 pre-trade was +1.8. His bWAR was -1.6.

That's because his peripherals were actually pretty good, but he just had a tendency to allow all his hits and walks in the same inning, which would result in giving up a shitload of runs. Since he gave up a shitload of runs, I would argue that he was ""worth"" -1.6 WAR to the Orioles in that period. But the Cubs knew his true talent was better than that, and we all know what happened after that. Because of that, the fWAR was a better indicator of how good of a pitcher he actually was, but the bWAR was a better indicator of the fact that his performance sucked ass during that time even though he was a pretty good pitcher.",baseball

"Well, a lot of calls are already reviewable. And yet we don't have your nightmare scenario of the game being held up after every single play while managers check the video.

The reality of reviewable calls is that there's already a built-in limit to how long a manager can take to decide whether to challenge, and there are only a couple times each game that managers even bother to have someone check the video to decide whether to challenge.

Since it already doesn't happen with the calls that are reviewable right now, why do you think it suddenly *would* happen if, say, the foul-tip scenario became reviewable? Or even ball/strike calls? Plus, the ones that would get a manager checking the tape are the ones that *already* hold up the game because somebody inevitably starts jawing at the umpire and either gets warned or ejected.

So I just don't see any merit to the argument that making more calls reviewable would massively slow the game down.",baseball
You have to be to the right of the foul line by the time you get 45 feet down the line. That is LITERALLY the only reason they draw that box from 45 feet to the bag. He is not there he is left of the foul line where he is not supposed to be.,baseball

"Why exactly is using a warcry for a team named after warriors racist? If Minnesota Viking fans started using Viking themed warcries as a way to rally the fanbase would that be racist? What about teams named Knights? Crusaders? What about the USC Trojans or Rainbow Warriors of Hawaii?

I don't think anyone in the world would argue that it isn't invoking Native Americans. But it's obviously used showing the idea of fear from the power the Native American warriors of the past showed, much in the same way that Vikings or Trojans or any other warrior is used. Noc-A-Homa and some of the other things the Braves did in the 60s-80s were much more questionable, but the chop itself is just a warcry.

Me personally, I enjoy it much more when the crowd spontaneously starts the chop instead of them playing it over the loudspeakers. It feels like there's a lot more impact when 40,000 people start doing it spontaneously rather than just because the stadium told them to.",baseball
"Opposite experience I had in SF. My family and I are die hard life long Tigers fans. In 2012 I was living in CA and my parents and I had a long-planned trip to San Francisco planned where they would meet me there from Detroit. It just so happened to be during the World Series where the Tigers and Giants were playing and we were visiting the city that week. 

We didn’t go to any of the games but we did walk around in Tigers apparel that week and let me tell you, I had Giants fans, even people not wearing giants gear, yelling at my mother on the bus and rail and on the street. Like legit mean stuff. “Go back to your shitty city!” and “Could the city of Detroit be more awful? What’s it like to visit a real city?!” type stuff. 

My mom is the kind of woman to give it right back to someone who says something that like that, so it was somewhat amusing and we laughed it off mostly, because the whole “Detroit sucks/Detroit is ruins” thing gets old and played out.

"If you think the human element messes up the game, that’s fine. I like the fact that you have to take the particular umpire’s strike zone into account. Makes it more interesting.

If it’s a strike all night you’d better at least be protecting. This is on Soto for not understanding what’s been called all night. 

Is it a shitty call in the context of the rules? Sure. My point is if he’s consistent shit, every pitcher will take advantage of it. Hell Greg Maddux went to Cooperstown by getting umpires to expand the strike zone.",baseball

It didn't look that way during the ALDS though. The Rays pushed the Astros to game 5 and the Yankees completely obliterated the Twins and looked really good doing it.

I hate that we didn't have Domingo German in our rotation for the playoffs but I'd hate it even more if the Yankees tried to ignore the domestic violence issues and fight his suspension just to get a bit of extra edge in the postseason. The ""winning at all costs"" attitude can be toxic and the MLB and teams have to know that short-term thinking like that leaves a bad taste in peoples mouths that eventually makes it hard to have any heartfelt support for them.

If they offered him the same deal without the bullshit moving the money ol around, I’m positive he’s still there right now because he wanted to stay there. 

Your also just being a Harper hater if you don’t think that team is even better with him there. Dude was there through it all and I feel for him cause I think he deserves to be apart of this instead of people bringing him up to shit on him.

Also Harper delivered results. Best season of anyone on the Phils and had a better year the last year. 

You can’t tell me this team isn’t better with him in RF instead of Eaton. Especially considering Harper had a 4.2 WAR this year which is great compared to Eatons 1.6 or Taylor’s literal 0. They be much better of with Harper in RF, Soto LF and Eaton/Robles platooning Center.",baseball

They have top end starting pitching and abysmal relief pitching. I, and many others, had written them off as playoff baseball had been trending toward relief pitching being more dominant than starting pitching and the Nats weakness would be exposed. 

However this postseason has seen starters across the board rise to dominance like its 15 years ago... and suddenly the Nats’ biggest weakness isn’t being exposed.

And unlike those other teams that want to keep payroll low to make a profit, the Pirates are in a decent market, and their owner is likely still one of the top 5-10 richest in the league.

I understand the frustration surrounding the umps, with lots of calls seeming to favor the Astros

How much would y’all say pitch framing accounts for calls swinging one way or the other?

I took a look at Fangraphs’ FRM statistic and sorted it based on a minimum of 100 innings played. Maldonado ranks top 30, Gomes ranks bottom half, Suzuki bottom 20, among 84 qualified catchers.

Aside from that egregious call in Brantley’s AB last inning that got Davey (deservedly) fired up, are the umps genuinely that bad, or is Maldonado’s defensive prowess that prevalent vs Suzuki’s and Gomes’ relative incompetence?",baseball
"Look, I’m not saying replacing is a perfect system, in fact I’m in favor of human umps because I like things like pitch framing and the human interaction between players and officials.

I’m also not saying football or basketball is a more complicated sport than the other. Stop getting actually butthurt about a simple statement. In the mlb, the umps have to look at one specific thing 98% of the time, people aren’t really moving, and they only have a couple of calls to look out for. Nfl has a very large field of way more people moving all over the place with three times as many calls they have to think about per play.

Also, if they really wanted, it would not be too difficult to make technology fair for making strikes and balls calls for baseball. I stand by that football and basketball would be impossible to make computer umps with current tech",baseball

"The 1926 World Series ended with Ruth trying to steal 2nd, the Yankees behind the Cardinals by one run, with one strike on Bob Meusel (.315/.373/.470 that season) and Gehrig in the on-deck circle.

"I’m one of those people who think that a human element of calling balls and strikes is okay, but then I started to think about what I meant by the human element and concluded that it was the idea of figuring out what the strike zone was - that some umpires just have different ideas of a strike. 

That’s why I evaluate maps at the end of the game not by the objective zone - but by drawing a box with the umpire’s farthest strikes and seeing how many incorrect calls there were by his very own standards. 

For those who believe that there should remain such a human element - my proposal for roboumps is to use the umpire’s own data in game for calls. Draw a box around the strikes the umpire calls and if there’s a call later in the game inconsistent with his own zone, then the roboump can overturn it. 

Of course, there’s some stuff that would need to be ironed out - like different batter heights, the fact that early game calls would set the zone so if an umpire badly misses own, everything is thrown off, and how to account for pitch framing (for those that like pitch framing), but I think this sets a good framework for keeping the human element with roboumps.",baseball

"&gt; Where he was prior to contact is irrelevant since it had no impact on the play.

This is not true.  In order to explain it more clearly, allow me to break down the rule.

1) The batter-runner *must* be in the 45-foot path once they reach the second half of the 1st-base baseline

2) If the batter-runner is not in this path and interferes with the fielder's ability to catch the ball, the batter-runner is out for interference

3) There is an exception to part 2 where batter-runner is *not* ruled out for interference, if (and only if) they are *exiting* the path in order to make contact with first base (emphasis mine)

That last part is incredibly important and is precisely why it does matter where he was prior to contact.  In order to exit the path you have to be in it in the first place.  Since Turner was never in the path, he is not subject to this exception and is therefore out for interference.",baseball

The other is a hulking young baseball player assaulting a woman when no one was around but him and her and then following through with beating her significantly. 

Seriously dude consider what you’re saying, because it ain’t it. Sorry, *man*",baseball
"Even of it's the correct call by the rules. That's fucking stupid. Trea turner ran to first as any normal player does (like altuve just did) it's not his fault the pitcher made a bad throw.

A clean throw makes this a non issue. A misktake by the defense shouldn't penalize the offense",baseball
"guys i have a buddy that works for the ump union and he sent me the draft of their statement about that call:

The protest by the Washington Nationals is misleading and completely irresponsible. An Astros player was being asked to make a difficult catch. Our executive was supporting the player during a difficult time. His comments had everything to do about the game situation that just occurred and nothing else — they were also not directed toward any specific players. We are extremely disappointed in the Nationals’s attempt to fabricate a story where one does not exist.",baseball
"Tbh I’m in a very similar boat and totally get what you’re saying. My dad watched one sport, football. And he was an eagles fan because he was from South Jersey outside philly, so I got that from him. But I was raised in north NJ and am yankees, nets, devils",baseball
"It was a fastball, which is even worse because I was looking at Rendon's pitch FX data, and I think he's never hit a fastball there for a HR

Not sure what Rendon saw or was trying to do, but seemed like neither the batter or pitcher expected the result that occurred",baseball
"If Washington had lost by a run, we’d be saying the same things people are saying about Acuña right now.

In the same vein, a Braves W tonight would’ve had everyone talking about Acuña’s clutch 2-run homer in the 9th to start the comeback. But since they didn’t happen, people look for reasons why the Braves lost.",baseball
"And most Royals fans' objections to Matheny as a potential manager has nothing to do with his faith – it has to do with his baseball track record with the Cards. 

I think Matheny's religion just comes up in discussions about him because it seems that's why he and Dayton Moore have become buddies; they go to the same church. And their friendship (not Matheny's managerial record) appears to be the main reason Moore brought him into the Royals org this past year.",baseball
"&gt; Nats fans are acting like the lower zone wasn't expanded the entire game.

Robot umps also don't replace the umpires job anyways so I doubt the union has a problem with it, they monitor what they think the strike zone is and feeds the info to the home plat ump, he still makes the ultimate call if it is strike or ball depending on if he thinks it doesn't match the batters strike zone or if it was wrong. (At least how it has been tested in other live games)  


They just need to make sure the system is accurate enough to implement.",baseball
"It makes sense. Shortstop is the toughest position so it gets a good positional adjustment and he had some great defensive years. 

However, no one will ever say he was a good hitter. He had only 2 seasons with an OPS+ of 100 or more, and those were in 1999 and 2002 (his age-32 and age-35 seasons).

Fun side note about SS defense: Rey Ordoñez's defense was so good that he was worth 2.8 bWAR in 1999 despite a .258/.319/.317 slash (64 OPS+) in 588 PA.",baseball

"I was saying before the series started that I wasn't sure that the Nats would win, but I was convinced it would at least be close.

"I disagree. It’s a rule certainly, but it’s also a judgement call. The guy ran straight, there was no intent noted and he out ran the shitty throw. And it’s a rule that in any other circumstance you wouldn’t see called. I can’t immediately recall seeing it called in a setting where it wasn’t flagrant, to be honest",baseball
"Actually good on him 

Not hiding from it. Interested to hear what he has to say

Edit: Really did not like his excuse. He basically said because Gurriel's glove came off ir was interference and that it is a judgement call. Well my judgement is that Gurriel made a bad stretch and did not have his glove on all the way",baseball

"In hindsight, it's clear that Bavasi just had no clue what he was doing.  Just absolute shit draft choices, tried to fix the team's problems by throwing big contracts at a handful of players when pretty much the whole roster needed turnover, and didn't properly capitalize on the prospects we had at the time (that ended up being absolute busts anyway) to better bolster the roster.  He passed on drafting Tulo - who we were committed to sign ffs - and picked Jeff Clement at the last minute instead.  If that's not a perfect encapsulation of the Bavasi era, I don't know what is.

Jack Z I think had a better idea of how to actually run a team (but that wasn't exactly a high bar to cross), but I think his ass was perpetually in the jackpot thanks to the years of Bavasi's ineptitude, so he kept trying to force the team into competitive status prematurely ~~(hence the Bedard trade)~~ nope that was Bavasi still, misremembered.  They were both awful for sure, but Bavasi was just advanced stupid levels of incompetent.",baseball
"100%. There wasn’t a for sure chance Acuña would’ve even scored if he was on second instead  of first, but springer would’ve def scored if he was on third because of what altuve did. The reason we lost our games was because of our bullpen and bullpen management (and game 5 ��)",baseball

"I don't understand why the pundits were all expecting an Astros domination, like winning in 4 or 5. It's as of all they compared were regular season records as if the Nats horrible start would mean something now.  Since the end of May the Nats have been one of, if not the, best team in baseball.  The Astros may well win the series, but it won't be in 5.",baseball

And the data is fluctuating so much that going from 18 games of data (I’m not sure when his data from the first graph is from but still) to 24 games of data makes the effect go from a 19% difference to less than a 5% difference?

"Fucking hell. Goddamn it Hader. Goddamn it Grisham. Goddamn it Brewers. Well, technically the Nats still haven't really done anything, because they've never had to play the Wild Card as the Nats OR as the Expos. So if the Dodgers smoke 'em out, they've still never really done anything. I mean, technically, they've accomplished something since they finally won a playoff series, but it's technically not the same since the Wild Card didn't exist when they won in 1981 as the Expos, the only time the franchise made it to the NLDS. I'll give the Nats begrudging congratulations. Soto absolutely pulled their asses out of the fire there with that bases clearing double.

"I’ll be honest, I was there and didn’t see it that way at all at the time.  We got steamrolled 19-8 the night before and we’re down 3 games to 0.  Walking in to Fenway that day felt like going to a funeral.  It was an exciting moment but felt like prolonging the inevitable.

Looking back on it, it was obviously a huge moment and to romanticize it now is appropriate and I would absolutely say it was the steal of the century.  That two weeks that followed through the WS is one of the happiest times of my life.

But no one thought what followed was even remotely possible after the steal, or Ortiz putting on in the pen, or even after Damon crosses the plate to win game 5.  The exact moment I started to believe it was possible was when Papi went deep in game 7 moments after Manny got gunned down at the plate, getting a runner hosed in game 7 at yankee stadium felt like what would have been a fatal mistake in the past but we bounced back up.",baseball

"those guys both debuted in their age 19/20 season.  Rendon played 3 years in college and debuted during his age 22/23 season.

edit -- i think i replied to the wrong comment, but anyway, a few other thoughts on duration:

arenado got an 8 year deal last year, but that was really a 7 year extension to his existing deal which went through 2019, so for fair comparison's sake, he's getting $234/7 starting with 2020.  i think 7-8 years is the sweet spot for rendon as well.  if the nats go up just a little but, maybe to $250, i think they could get him signed for 7 years as long as they don't go too crazy with the deferrals.  that'd be significantly more AAV than Bryce over that same time span.

rendon turns 30 next june.  so i don't think anyone besides the nats is going to want to lock him in for his entire 30s.  so 7-8 still sounds about right for him.  the nats might have an advantage over other teams in that regard if they want to offer a 9 year deal with decent AAV that tapers off the last 2-3 years.",baseball

2. As losing the series is the consequence of losing game 6 or 7, the consequences of losing games 6 and 7 are equivalent.

"To quote an individual I met on r/baseball:

&gt; Not any different from your baseball/sports teams it sounds like they do a good job of surrounding themselves with trash.

Looks like it was you that strayed from baseball, into other sports; where Tom Brady has more championships than every NFL team in New York combined.  Where calling the Knicks “the Mets of the NBA” is one of the nastiest things you can say about the Mets. And I don’t even know which one of your hockey teams you root for, but they all just came out of the gate dead so it doesn’t matter, though it was nice of you to let John Tavares go and see what a game 7 with a legitimate team is like. Maybe one day you’ll let Saquon Barkley experience a playoff run when you’re done throwing the entire team on his shoulders and keeping him on the shelf. But that got off topic. Back to baseball and New York’s 2nd most interesting MLB team. 

Let’s break this down for you into the English where a sentence starts with “lol” and ends with “fam”:

First, credit where it’s due: congrats on finally winning the AL East! Even though the team that always left you in the WC game “sucks”. Not a great look there at all but hey, every step counts.  Moving ahead, 

2019 WS Ring Count is tied at 0, you can call dibs and claim it now if you want, but I’d advise against it after seeing how your last premature celebration ended. Also, it’ll be tough to explain how that ring you won just now wound up in a place like Tampa, Houston, LA, St. Louis, Atlanta, Oakland, Minnesota, DC, or Milwaukee a couple weeks later. 

And I’m not running from baseball, it’s just nice to succeed more than once every couple years and not have to carry on and on about getting the chance to fight for the chance to (get turned inside out by Houston) fight for a ring. The Red Sox are still the World Champs as of you writing this, so come on, take our title. It’s yours for the taking right? Be a perfect ending to a perfect story if you did. For a crew so proud of “27 rings”, you think you’d act like you’ve at least been near one before.  

But what do I know, it’s been almost a year since my last championship. Best of luck, gonna be some hungry teams in your way that I’m honestly way more concerned with. It’d just be awkward to get swept right out of the gate because you’re too focused on us. The current Champs. The Boston Red Sox. The only Boston Team even in your weight class. So get going, someone’s gotta take this title from us and I’ve seen 9 other teams lock eyes on this and not give a shit who has it. Don’t look now, but I think some of them want it more than you do.

So figure that out, I’m gonna read up on my undefeated, oh, also reigning champion NFL team, and get some rest. Don’t dream about us too much",baseball

"In 2016 NLCS, with 2 outs Roberts had his pitcher load the bases by intentionally walking Jason Heyward, the worst position player hitter in all of 2016, and the worst post season batter in history (minimum 200 PA). The next batter hit a grand slam. The Dodgers lost the lead and game.

Roberts has a history of terrible moves. Maddon is simply better. He puts his players in positions to succeed. Meanwhile Roberts constantly finds ways to set up a top 10 pitcher of all time for failure.",baseball
 MLB answered the question asked. Was the ball altered to increase offense in which they answered no the ball was not changed to increase offense. Every article I see is asking if the ball is juiced. This idea that MLB controls the manufacturing process is crazy. They set specifications for the ball. It is Rawlings and their engineers responsibility to design a process to meet those specifications. They have full authority to change any of the processes to meet the specifications more efficiently or more precisely.,baseball
"That just brings us back to the same thing I mentioned earlier, cities and rural areas have different cultures. Most trends show that cities will continue to grow in size for the foreseeable future and it seems that the more dense a population center is the more Democrat leaning it is.

I mean at some point in time we may arrive at a situation where 90% live in the cities and 10% in rural areas. 

How, do you form a government that will fairly represent the interests of both? 

I honestly dont know how to do it, at least at a state level. Perhaps something like a parliamentary system or some type of ranked choice voting.",baseball
"Real answer: baseball playoffs are crazy fucking random.  You're taking this series as evidence that the Astros are 'better' than the Yankees, or 'outplaying' them?  Don't.  They *are* better than the Yankees (by a small amount), but if they win this series it will be 10% because they're better, 90% because the luck went their way.  A seven game series just isn't enough games to conclusively prove the difference between two teams.  The **Orioles** could beat the Astros in a seven game series if they got lucky enough.

The Red Sox might have actually been better than the Astros last season, they were a really good team.  But every World Series winner is crazy lucky.",baseball

Sure. But it doesn’t come even remotely close to what Madbum did. It boils down to I don’t think CC is a HOF caliber pitcher. Sure you can use the brewers one and that was really great... during the regular season. MadBum did it on the biggest stage multiple times. I just don’t think CC had that kind of greatness in him.

"The entire debacle today was non-reviewable because it was a ""judgement call"" which means that it is up to the umpire's judgement if the rule is enforced or not. infield fly is also a judgement call. An umpire absolutely can enforce or not enforce certain rules depending on the situation. An umpire has basically unlimited judgement to call anything he wants a ball or a strike. The rules give him that leeway. Does that mean that a pitch 2 feet above the batter's head can be called a strike? Yes, the rules allow him to do that. Does that mean it's a good call that he should have called because the rules allow it? NO.

Just because an ump *may* call an infield fly rule in that game doesn't mean he should and definitely doesn't mean he *must*. Just because an ump *can* call interference on this play doesn't mean he has to call it.

This is in contrast to rules like foul balls, home runs, runners being tagged, etc that are not judgement calls and *must* be enforced and are reviewable because they are an indisputable yes or no question. So no, that infield fly call was shit and just because the rules say it can be called does not make it a good call.",baseball

"No it was never cut and dry. Osuna's lawyer has maintained that Osuna did not assault the woman. Here is a good summary of all the facts:

Even the so-called ""remorseful"" comment by the Astros is dubunked in the article [and by ESPN's Buster Olney](https://twitter.com/Buster_ESPN/status/1024950947796140032).

The truth is, I don't believe Osuna is completley innocent. I believe he and his GF were both guilty in this situation and probably he was trying to defend himself while she attacked him and she ended up hurt. He probably got over aggressive with her, which is why he accepted the suspension. But it's possible he could have been hurt worse from her actions, so he felt he had no choice.

I don't know, I'm only speculating, but it fits with how the story has unfolded and the fact that she obviously has no interest in pressing charges against him.",baseball

"They weren’t reviewing the play, everyone just thought they were at first. What the umpires were doing when they put on the headsets was conferring with New York once the Nationals informed them of their intent to protest the game. That’s the first part of the protocol. 

On a play like this, even more so given that it’s the World Series, the umpires have to determine if the call is something that *can* be protested. The guidelines for protesting a call stipulate that it be an instance where a rule was not applied correctly *and* that it CANNOT be a judgment call. The delay was due to a discussion between the umpiring crew and New York to determine whether or not the Nationals could protest.

The weird part was when they signaled “out” before restarting play, although that could have just been to clarify the decision they had already made and enforce sending Gomes back to first. I think that might have been why Davey Martinez freaked out between half innings, because it was an unnecessarily long delay. That exacerbated the perception that the umpires were wrong.",baseball

When I left for college at 18 I had lived at 23 ""permanent"" addresses. My baseball experience started in '97 when I lived in southern New Mexico, so I was a DBacks fan. But in '03 I moved out of the southwest for good, and in the whirlwind I lost my DBack attachment.

I latched onto my grandma for sports teams, who lives in Olympia, WA. She's not doing so well right now and so I've been going over my relationship with her recently. She had a huge influence on how I viewed sports and who I root for. Anytime the Seahawks, Sonics, or Mariners lost, she'd just say ""they were better"". No one wins every game and you need to respect you are going to lose to even your most bitter rivals. And the Astros the last few years have just been better than the Ms. I'm ok with that, even if it sucks.

I'm not ok with fans not understanding how baseball works and how decisions are made during a baseball game. The game is most interesting when managers and players consistently make the most correct decisions, and we shouldn't shame people for making them, even when the outcome isn't what we hoped for.",baseball

"They get praised because hitting major league pitching is really, really difficult.  And in the minors, many leagues makes use of the DH or otherwise have rules that limit pitcher at-bats. (It varies by league and circumstance).

You could ask the same question of DHs - why are they praised for simply being good at one phase of the game? They are only asked to hit. Why? Is it because their defense is often substandard or their arms poor? Is it because they rarely run the bases at any speed besides below average? Outside of Shohei Ohtani, they certainly aren't asked to pitch.

No, they are valued for their power and ability to reach base. Because all you need to do as a DH is hit, it makes it a very  difficult job. You aren't judged on anything else, and that is both a blessing (if your are defensive liability) and curse (if you stop hitting, you almost have no value to the club).",baseball

over that same time frame pollock hit lefties at a .272/.325/.506 clip

signing a guy bc of handedness only matters if you're looking specifically to get better in an area like the dodgers were against LHP, but they literally signed a guy who was worse against lefties than a left handed hitting option, who also happens to hit righties way, way, way fucking better.

signing pollock instead of harper was always a terrible idea, and it got even worse when the dude went 0/13 with 11 K's. and they didn't sign pollock over harper because they needed guys to hit lefties, they signed pollock over harper because they didn't want to pay harper the money that he was worth.",baseball

If you’re going to keep it though make it 3 games and maybe shorten the season a bit.  I’ll admit I’m kind of biased being that we had the top wild card 3 straight years and got shut down 2 straight years by pitchers facing historic seasons/postseasons.  You could have 10 less wins than the other wildcard but as long as they have a top 5 pitcher going they’re going to be heavy favorites.,baseball

They're sporting 3 Aces in their rotation; a historic 1-2 of Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole, who will finish 1st and 2nd in Cy Young voting this year, followed by former Cy Young winner Zack Greinke.  That's going to be tough to beat in the playoffs.  Terrifyingly, their lineup is just as strong as their pitching.

Once they decided 75 games was the punishment warranted, that was that.  An argument could be made that he deserved more.  Personally, I think he should've gotten a full season, but I'm not a huge fan of lifetime bans for first offenses on anything.

The umps know he was trying to make the throw more difficult, he was outside of his lane, and then literally interferes with the ability of the first baseman to make the catch.

I watched Game 3 at Yards Park in DC.  The organizers had a pregame concert, and then set up a big TV for everyone to watch. Altogether, there were easily a thousand+ people watching this single TV.  The bars were all packed too. Viewership was probably down in DC (and Houston) because people watched in large groups rather than by themselves at home.",baseball
"Nats and Caps have consistently been a top 5 team for the past 10ish years. They kept knocking on the Championship door until they finally got in.

Redskins on the other hand have barely been top 5 in the NFC East. Window was never open for it to be closed for them.",baseball
"r/Astros or r/Houston might help you get more then the general discussion here. 

When are you thinking about coming to visit? If possible try either early or late in the season, when there’s a higher likelihood of the roof being open. Also the heat + humidity won’t be as bad. July/August here for the uninitiated can be suffocating and really limits any outdoor activities. 

Hopefully you can make it down. If I can help with any questions or recommendations let me know!",baseball
"Is there a worse fan base in all of professional sports? Washington is a pseudo city, totally paid for by other peoples (taxpayers) money, full of people who aren’t from there and who will leave at the next election. Give me a fucking break on the Harper shit already. He’s a great player who did just fine in Philly.",baseball
The problem is that the reality of what umpires have been calling for years is inconsistent. It changes dramatically by what the count is and also varies across umpires. It's also changed year-to-year a lot based on what the officiating coordinators are telling their umps. They have lowered it when there's been too much offense and raised it back up when there hasn't been enough offense.,baseball
"The first problem here is the *umpire* saying, ""Hey, it wasn't me..."" obviously alluding to the software that indicates a strike. 

But the point is this umpire *still* found a way to inject himself into the situation. Just shut the fuck up dude. The batter is frustrated that he can't get feedback or give any information to that stupid fucking software. 

That ump is a jackass AND this software strike-calling is ridiculous. Final answer.",baseball
"Legit question: would be it be legal to just carry your bat all the way around the bases? Why not... you can apparently carry it almost to first base at least, so at what exact point would it stop being legal?  
   
Unless there's a specific rule, it'd be legal I guess... kind of awesome if you held it up and waved around too...",baseball
"Oh yeah, I guarantee you 99% of these people blaming addicts for being addicts would never, ever consider the possibility that **they** might be put in that position someday, that it can happen to ANYONE. 

Creeping through post histories, most of the people blaming Skaggs completely and absolving the organization are the same kind of people who blame poor people for being poor. they ignore systemic institutional and cultural problems in american society that lead to this.",baseball

"Largely because the people asking them aren’t trained to cross examine people or even ask leading questions or for that matter are very intelligent. They’re former athletes, models, and actors. They look good on tv. Some can’t even speak English properly. Some, like A-Roid, can’t speak English or Spanish properly.",baseball
It would’ve been fun to have a Braves Nats NLCS. The shittalking implications of such a series would be legendary. But for now making the boomer birds look dumb is good enough. It’s weird to actually say this but I am pulling for the Nats to make the World Series if not win if the opponent is the Yankees. Good luck to y’all.,baseball
"I would agree with you here. I've always learned you hedge by offsetting the risk at either result. 

Like banks buying forwards for F/X at a set rate and selling forwards for F/X at a set rate.

You hope for one result since its more valuable but if it doesn't happen you still have the other option to minimize the risk.",baseball
"I can tell you anecdotally there are definitely players in HS, College and at least a few minor leaguers that are taught to do that, or at least that it's an option.  

Similar to how the first thing you try to do when caught in a rundown is find a way to run into a fielder.",baseball
"It’s not my only exposure to the group though, and if it’s your only exposure to the group then shame on you. If all you can think about when you see the chop is dated cartoon Indians shame on you, not the chop... Grew up in Alabama went to the Indian reservation every year where actual native people taught us about the way of life for their people, their values and rich history. They also showed us traditional celebrations and the importance of the tribes structure. We talked about the atrocities they went through and lasting community struggles of today. There’s also plenty of reading material and video out there that’s educational and not “cartoonish”. The chop doesn’t play on a myth. The chop is a made up “war-cry” to motivate and intimidate at sporting events, nothing more. It’s a chant that is overused, but not derogatory. My brain doesn’t naturally turn to discrimination or hate when I think of the American Indian. If yours does, then maybe you should do something about that. Nothing is stopping you from having exposure to a more full view of indigenous culture. If you actually want to support the Native American cause and not just act like you’re accomplishing something by calling Braves fans racist then support their environmental conservation efforts, support better education and schooling, etc.",baseball
"&gt; Why be offended on behalf of people that aren’t offended?

To be clear I'm not. I didn't care before that the Braves did it and I don't care now that they aren't. Someone said they didn't like it and it was a bit offensive and the Braves said they would limit it. That's it. It's not really a big deal.

Its a fucking swinging arm motion. Fans can find some other arm motion they can all do in unison. Losing the chop won't hurt anyone except for a few weak minded peoples feelings.",baseball
"&gt; Using Kershaw was just getting cute for no reason. Kershaw isn't holy crap Clayton Kershaw anymore

I mean he's still top 10 in ERA in the NL. 

I don't think the issue is Kershaw being washed up, I think the problem is more he didn't play the matchups. Maeda vs Rendon and Kolarek vs Soto is the much smarter matchup.l",baseball
"Not sure, but 2008 WS Game 3 was 24 year old Matt Garza vs 45 year old Jamie Moyer.  That has to be up there.

Edit: The more I think about it, the more I think this might be it.  It's either that or Moyer vs Ubaldo Jimenez in the 2007 NLDS, unless Roger Clemens or Randy Johnson faced off against someone 21 or younger in the 2000s...",baseball
"&gt;You don't want the actions of some jerk from the Front Office of a team to overshadow the biggest week of your sport.

Maybe that jerk shouldn't be in a position to do such a thing, then? And maybe other FO members like him would think twice before embarrassing their sport if there were real consequences for their actions?

Or are you in the camp of 'It already happened, nothing more you can do now without looking bad' only for it to happen again down the road and we go through this same dance again?",baseball
"Totally. I coach hs baseball and curveballs are such a fucking crap shoot. Sometimes they call it where it crosses, sometimes they call it where the catcher catches it, and sometimes they call everything that breaks a strike, even if it started outside and finishes four inches out.  Other times a filthy one folds a guy up n the box and they don’t call it because the kid ducked.  I for one welcome our robot overlords",baseball
"&gt; That was the first year of the new playoff format and only year they went with a 2 games at lower seeded team first then 3 games at home in the ALDS.  

Wait, I liked that better.  Now the low seed team gets the first elimination game.",baseball
"Personally, it can't get any worse than not winning a WS. We get a new guy, it doesn't work out and we don't even make the postseason... so what? Oh no, we broke our streak of division titles lmao

I was calling for his head last year. It's better to try something new and fail, with the possibility of succeeding however, than continue with the old and continue to fail. Because that's what we're doing with Roberts, failing. Only the ring matters.

Your example is on point like also the Eagles firing Andy Reid. You move on and if the next guy is not the guy, you continue to move on until you find the right one. Roberts has to go.",baseball
"Yes. He is. But for the remainder of the game? At what point does it go from being sad to not understanding the game is bigger than you? There’s a reason baseball people make such a huge deal about pitchers abandoning their teams if they hide in the clubhouse after they’re pulled with runners on. They’re not allowed to hide and sulk because it sends the wrong message.

Yes he can be sad. But for how many innings before the broader public notices every other player who wears a Dodger uniform on the top step cheering, and Kershaw **still** sulking in his own failure. 

He’s soft the same way Alex was soft in the playoffs. And every Yankees fan thought it before 2009. Too in his head, cares too much what people think.",baseball
"Just happy Harper isn’t there, and everyone can see that he doesn’t really bring that much to a team. Overpaid, he’s good don’t get me wrong but he’s not anywhere near as good as his salary would indicate. Obviously the Phillies will be making most of that back with sales of his jersey and tickets but still lol.",baseball
He lost his slider. The first pitch of the second inning he threw one that backed up into the right handers batters box and then lost all confidence in it. He either has it or he doesn't and he should have been pulled after that. Or the after the walk. Or after the double. Or after the IBB...,baseball
"To be fair, I bet he's a good dude and I'm fairly certain the entire Angels experiment was his wife grasping for Hollywood clout. It all failed, they separated and he is living a chill life in a mellow Texas town. But man, for $20M+ a season I really was hoping for some more homers than weeks on the DL.",baseball
"&gt; but there’s something special about May 24th I guess.

Because the stat isn't ""wow look how much better we are than the Astros specifically"", it's about how hot the Nats were and how they played since they stopped sucking and turned their season around.

Like of course all the games count - that's why we were the wild card team instead of the division winner (and nearly lost), and why we had to play the Dodgers in the NLDS instead of the Cardinals (and nearly lost). But the point of the stat isn't to be ""ackshually we're the best team in baseball"", it's to show how good the team is when everything clicks.",baseball
"Bo was arguably a top-5 RB in football before his injury. 

As for baseball, he wasn’t great but he was still probably a starter. 

Also I thought we stopped caring what Bill James has to say, his last 4/5 years has been pretty much a “back in my day!” Old man rant, but with analytics.",baseball
"Fun fact: Kids under the age of 25 or so are too young to remember the Yankees 1996-2000 run, so to them, the Yankees history of dominance almost looks like the Toronto Maple Leafs: A weird historical fact that's out of synch with the modern day.  Those people can only remember a single Yankees World Series, so that puts them on par with teams like the Kansas City Royals.",baseball
"Yeah it was the perfect storm of bad product combined with not being able to see it on TV for like 2/3 of the city. It was a shitty situation but they tore it down and rebuilt from the ground up and it paid off big time.

I do miss $7 tickets and then sitting wherever you wanted. That was awesome back in the shit years.",baseball
"Contrary to popular belief - he's kind of a hardass. He would always be the one to call players out if they had their heads up their ass. He's also the guy that kept Lester on a leash.

Does this make him a good manager? No idea. But the narrative that he's a big goofy friendo to all the guys in the clubhouse is taken from his attitude in interviews, announcing gigs etc.",baseball
"So I want to be clear as to your statement. 

If you live in a given city - you *must* be fans of a that city's franchises? Correct or not?

If you live in a city and decide that that franchise no longer brings you happiness and you decide that you want to change allegiances, you a ""fairweather"" fan? Correct or not? 

If your franchise owner is a buffoon and has driven the franchise into the ground of your city, you *must* stick with that team, even though it will (given the lousy ownership) be horrible and not bring you happiness? Correct or not?

I must ask this final question

Peter Angelos is that you?",baseball
"And what if your division was, hypothetically speaking, comprised of four other AAA teams, and even with that you manage a lesser record than another team. Still ""win your division""? See, you're all using geography as a crutch.

I know you're going to say 'no u', downvote and be on your merry way, simply out of spite. But you know what I'm saying makes sense.",baseball
"A friend asked how many World Series rings the Nationals roster has right now.

I looked into it, using Baseball Reference, and the total is zero for their active roster, and *one* for their 40-man roster (&gt;!Hunter Strickland with the 2014 Giants!&lt;). ~~In total, there's only ***two*** players that have appeared in any World Series~~.

~~A few members of the roster either joined a team the year after winning the Series, and a few others left the year before a team won it all.~~

Edit: I shouldn't do any ""research"" on mobile while commuting.",baseball
"I feel like people forget that Harper is only 26 because he's been in the league since he was 19.. Over that time, he's amassed 31.5 bWAR.  
  
According to bbref, his similarity scores through age 26 are:  
Andruw Jones -  62.8 bWAR, 42.5 through his age 26 season  
Justin Upton - 34.2 bWAR, 19.4 through his age 26 season  
Ken Griffey Jr.* - 83.8 bWAR, 50 through his age 26 season  
Eddie Matthews* - 96.6 bWAR, 45.5 through his age 26 season  
    
That's pretty good company. Two of which are HoF. Nonetheless, I think that Bryce only needs to average 3ish WAR over the next 12 seasons or so, and he'll be a shoo in.",baseball
"While we're complaining about At Bat, can someone over at that dev team please make it use a 16:9 aspect ratio?  All the new phones coming out are super *looong* and use like 20:9 aspect ratio, and At Bat is just like ""fuck it, fill the whole thing up"", and Vladdy is already thick enough as it is...",baseball
"It is literally just those words. i wasn't trying to make a larger point about Rizzo and Martinez being similar, literally just word association and making a joke

Rizzo wasn't being disrespectful or anything, but you have to admit it's kind of funny to say that after being tagged out in a rundown after a 70 MPH bloop single",baseball

"he spent the year in AAA, where he hit .275 on the year, which aint exactly tearing up the PCL even for a catcher.  He's a half year behind in his development since he missed AA time for a PED suspension. 

Our ""next man up"" backup catcher is on the 60-day DL with an arm injury, so that's why he's getting the shot.",baseball
I don't think it's accurate to say that they correlate. WAR is just supposed to be a way to compare players. I believe baseball reference has their theoretical replacement team winning 52 games in a year. I don't think you can add up a team's WAR because not everyone on the 25 man roster plays every game or every inning of every game.,baseball
Braves fans keep pointing out how they should’ve won that series and they could have beat the Nats etc. The only reason the Braves/Cards NLDS was competitive was that it was a pillow fight. The Cardinals weren’t sharp and the Braves couldn’t buy a hit when they needed one. Neither of those teams was deserving of the NLCS.,baseball
"This is why a lot of people (myself included) consider Game 3 (and also considered Game 2) a must-win from the Astros' point of view.

If we win one with Greinke, that's huge.  But the Yankees did what they needed to do in Game 1 and that means we have to take one game in NY, and if we don't do it with Cole, it's a tall order to either win the Game 4 crapshoot or try to beat playoff Tanaka at home.",baseball
"Rule 5.09 (a)(11) Comment (Rule 6.05(k) Comment): The lines marking the three-foot lane are a part of that lane and a batter-runner is required to have both feet within the three-foot lane or on the lines marking the lane. The batter-runner is permitted to exit the three-foot lane by means of a step, stride, reach or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base for the sole purpose of touching first base.",baseball
"The moving the bag argument is ridiculous and here's why: even if you move the bag it still means you, as a righty, at some point, have to deviate outside the line to touch the base. Moving a bit to your right is something almost every runner instinctively do when sprinting out of home plate. And they do not do it half way through the base, they do it almost immediately after leaving home plate.

People saying it's the right call cause of the rule but it shouldn't have been called for it's the world series are also kinda bias. 

I'm pretty damn sure Turner knew that running all the way inside the lane he could have been called out. This is something your couches teach you at camp. But then again, it's the world series, and they were winning by just a run, and he might have thought that the chances of him getting on base by the ball hitting him was a real situation that could have been beneficial if the play wasn't called interference.",baseball
"In 2012, 2017 and 2019 he was a major, major reason why the Yankees didn't win the ALCS. 

The 2012 Yankees probably don't win regardless, once Jeter went down. But the 2017 Yankees very likely win the World Series if Verlander wasn't Verlander. And I'd take this year's team over the Nationals. 

Was said mostly tongue-in-cheek and there's no way of knowing, but it is what it is.",baseball
"I really like Trevor May a lot.  His Q&amp;A at the press conference yesterday made me feel better about this whole thing and whatever happens today.  Admittedly, I didn't really expect him to be part of the leadership this team needs but I'm glad he's taking some of that on.  He's a good dude.",baseball
"Well baseball unlike other sports is essentially an individual sport packed in a team setting. In basketball having LeBron make 3 point shooters better and vice versa. Tom Brady releasing the ball quickly make his oline better. 

But Mike Trout cant elevate the Angels beyond hitting well on his turn of the order",baseball
"From what I have read, the games are being captured in 1080p. So 4k would be up-scaled from that and not much of an improvement, if any(there are tricks, like higher bitrate though). To keep it simple, 4k is the size of four 1080 screens, usually with higher image quality. In this case, since the video cameras might be capturing at 1080p, the true higher quality of a 4k capture will not occur.",baseball
"Is that story of Altuve getting rejected at 16 because he was ‘too small’ true? 

I’m a newbie and this guy has the ultimate sauce, ridiculously talented. I was watching the game with 3/4 Yankee fans and they were talking shit about every single Astro, apart from Altuve.

Also, he looks the best in an Astros kit.",baseball
"They could theoretically land Cole. It would require a relatively large bump in payroll. They spent roughly $166.5 million in 2018 and $159 in 2019. Let’s say they add $14 million to the 2018 payroll total amount. On the books now, i.e. before arbitration dollars are added, is $115 million. Add (I’m spitballing) $20 million for players in arbitration and pre-arbitration. That’s puts the Angels at $135 million. Cole will likely get, at least, $33 AAV, which puts them at $168 million. Leaving another $12 million to play with. It’s definitely feasible. It would likely be their only big time free agent

"I was very confused, because early in the piece you express a comfort with the Trop and a willingness to attend Rays games. I kept reading and you never once suggested just being a Rays fan.

It's maybe never been cooler to be a Rays fan than right now. They're really fucking good and since you've been attending games since you were a kid and are local, it's not bandwagon-y (if you care about that, there is nothing wrong with bandwagoning because baseball is supposed to be fun).

Yes, the stadium rarely fills and when it does it's full of fans of the away team, but attendance didn't stop them from being good this year anyway. 

Just prepared to get your heart broken when/if they end up moving because of all that stuff I said about nobody going to games :-(",baseball
"I dont think the WS is that important in this context, making large markets viable contenders is the best. Best things that could happen to MLB is Toronto, Seattle, San Diego, and Philly making the playoffs. Also I think things like the Dodgers winning the NL West every year keeps LA happy but there would be more fans if someone like Arizona and Colorado won occasionally. No one will drop MLB for one year without a division when people could pick it up too see how the #2 seed dbacks fair.

For this postseason, MLB should be hoping for Washington vs Atlanta NLCS and Yankees vs Astros ALCS, I think Tampa’s a lost cause and this is a good time to shore up some intermediate fans in WAS/ATL. Yankees can get the most fair weather support and end a long pennant drought for Yankee standards. Yankees/Braves World Series with NY winning would make the most fans and money IMO.",baseball
"OP is posting when players passed Trout, not that there's a tie for most WAR. Trout is 6th among hitters since 1997 in fWAR. 7th since 1992 (Bagwell), and so on. 

It's only an interesting stat because Trout's so young. It's a lot less interesting when you say that Bonds has the most fWAR amongst hitters since 1919.",baseball
"The reason I love baseball is because you can ""just decide to go""

I've been having lunch on my day off and while sitting in the restaurant I'll say ""I feel like going to the game tonight"" and look at tickets, if I find a good deal, I'll go, if not, no big deal...

With hockey and especially NFL, you make plans in advance to go, your day revolves around it.

I could go into a huge diatribe about how MLB stadiums make the most sense to be downtown vs NFL stadiums for the economic overflow.  (you've got 70,000 people coming 8 times a year vs 25k 81 times per year) Restaurants can only fill up so much...",baseball

"I care about history and know a lot about it but it does not hold the same place in my heart as something I watched live. 

Musial is the greatest Cardinal of all time and yet for me Pujols will always be that guy because I watched him do it and the numbers he was putting up were comparable to the old guys. 

I think the best way to put it is that the history of the game is a curiosity to me where my fandom is put aside and it is just something fun to learn about. 

Where as the different sports teams I have followed and watched during my lifetime will always matter to me a lot more because the chart the passage of my life.

My opinion will always be shaped by what I have seen because I cannot quantify numbers on a page and grainy videos in the same way I can careers I followed from beginning to end.",baseball
Reminds me a lot of the Caps right now.  They got over the Pittsburgh hump and steam rolled .  Super nervous as a DC fan we all sit and wait for the inevitable soul crushing loss.   This team is amazing to watch if you like low scoring and amazing pitching but fuck it’s  nerve wracking,baseball

Except that here in the MLB we have many documented cases of Umpires and their attitudes running players out of the game for their own fuck ups. It shouldn’t fucking matter who is umpiring where. I shouldn’t know Lance Barksdales name except for the fact that his strike zone is ass. If we adopt Trackman or the next system to call balls and strikes things will be consistent.,baseball
It costs money to go to baseball games. I’m not gonna shame people for not spending money to go to baseball games because there are more important things in life and the experience of a regular season game is generally comparable on TV.

"Question from the commentary about the crazy number of Rays lineups:

Is there a certain number of games you have to be on a team's roster to get a ring if your team wins?

Like say you got called up for 1 series and you don't get called up again that season do you still get one?",baseball
Hmmm I’m not sure players are that affected by something external like that but I guess we‘ll probably never know. I suppose it’s possible they lost sleep over it or something and were tired and slower. Feels like the Astros organization kept it as distanced from the players as possible though.,baseball
"Scherzer does not look sharp today, and the Astros were inches away from this being a 3-0 lead with one of the best pitchers in the game. At this point, if I were the Nats coach, I'd be in ""one baserunner and I'm getting a guy warming up in a hurry"" territory.

"Rainouts push Game 7 to Halloween, and Bryce Harper, in the spirit of the holiday, shows up in Houston disguised as Ryan Zimmerman (who he has kidnapped). In the top of the 9th, “Zimmerman” hits a go ahead home run, and Harper completes his task of bringing a title back to DC.

The ultimate sleeper agent, because if there’s one thing the rest of the NL East can agree on, it’s fuck the Phillies most of all.",baseball
"If you want to lean towards the most generous possible interpretation, maybe.

But Bryce lobbed some not-so-thinly veiled criticism at Dusty over the two years he was here, especially after the 2017 NLDS loss to you guys. It definitely came off as a “fuck you Dusty” to me and I know I’m not alone among Nats fans in that interpretation",baseball
"Why is anyone shocked that the head of the Astros is an asshole?

This is an organization that:
 - relies on signal stealing through off the field means
 - is always looking for an off the field edge when it comes to hitting and pitching
 - has a manager who is as arrogant as they come
 - acquires wife beaters and in the same breath releases statements about how they want to fight domestic abuse

Its the baseball version of the Patriots.  Lets face it, if you were told there was a big corked bat scandal brewing, wouldnt your first thought be that its the Astros?  They are a classless organization from top down.",baseball

"There’s a lot of both but to say one is way bigger than the other (in DC anyway) is just off. Cap One Arena for any home hockey game is always a shit ton of fun and during the playoffs it’s on a whole other level. 

Lived here for over 10 years and due to the Caps having a run of being consistently good, but not good enough (until 2018), they gained a lot of fans. 

As for the Skins, I live downtown and barely see anyone wearing Skins jerseys anymore. I know most of my Skins stuff are tucked away in storage.

Just look at pictures of crowds from the Stanley Cup parade if you think people here don’t care as much for the Caps or pictures of the streets of DC after we won. Shit was absolutely insane.",baseball
"I understand the argument for it, but the greater Baltimore population of that is less than 3 million, which is comparable to Cincinnati and St. Louis.  A lot of that population is in Northern VA or actually south of Washington, where they would actual have to bypass Nationals territory to get to an Os game.  MLB even realized this and made a somewhat fair offer to Peter Angelos to compensate him which they have basically reneged on.

Keep in mind Philly is also very close and shares a good chunk of their market.  MASN is not even available on a lot of southern PA due to the Phillies territorial rights even though a lot of towns are less than 30 minutes away.",baseball

"Honestly? Because sports are popular because they’re unifying. There are republicans and democrats, Muslims and Christians, immigrants and native born US citizens all gathering around and rooting for something *together*. And that matters. Especially in a city as diverse as Houston, it’s important that we can all come together and unify around something and put all our differences aside for a few hours a couple times a week. When Altuve hit the walk off home run and the Juice Box was going crazy, people high fiving and hugging total strangers, do you think anyone gave a shit who they voted for? Or what their opinion on any political issue was? Hell no, and that’s what makes sports so important for a city, and for our country as a whole.

Bringing politics into sports ruins that.",baseball
"and the ball before the Correa HR was actually a ball. Close but still a ball. I get that everyone wants consistency, and perhaps the Astros have benefitted a bit more, but Cole wasn’t given that pitch a half inning before, got pissed and made his pitch the next time.

"The movement in Witcher 3 is clunky as hell, which is probably the biggest flaw to me. The story of the game is well worth the price, and especially if you get the complete edition which adds probably 30-40 hours to the game with the massive DLC's that are included in it.",baseball
"There's a good case to be made that pitching velocity increased drastically, causing strikeouts to surge, and the change in launch angle and hitting approach was a reaction from the hitting side of the equation to maximize results when actually making contact. Thus the proposition to move the mound back to restore balance between hitting and pitching again. Of course that comes with a lot of problems too, but it makes sense that pitching velocity is the root cause of the 3 true outcome style baseball we're seeing today.",baseball
"My point is that it’s been a fuckin minute since Cash successfully negotiated with Boras or a high level FA.

"This is bad. And it’s probably next to the Super Bowl in terms of hurt and anger. But in all honesty, I did everything I could to not get my hopes up before this game. I’d seen this movie play out so many times before, so I didn’t really try. I kept myself open to the possibility we might win, but I tried everything I could to not get too excited about any scenarios where we might’ve won. It’s not that I didn’t want to have faith so much as I just didn’t want to invest myself so deeply when I knew this was a possibility. If there’s anything I take from it, I hope our front office realizes that they have to find a way to get elite talent here somewhere. It’s still “good but not great”, and that’s just not gonna get it done. I want them to see that that is unacceptable. But my mood is such that I don’t want to waste my energy being so negative that I can’t enjoy my life. I can’t control if the team ever gets over the hump, so I just don’t want to worry about something I have no control over.

Now if you’re talking about the Falcons, then yeah there’s no getting over that. I will never be over that, and I think it’s going to be a while before they have a shot at redemption for it, if they ever do.",baseball
"I’m a Dolphins fan living in South Florida, so I have thought about the game in Jacksonville many times. 

The way the first inning went, I’d say they’re about even. Records were broken on both occasions, not the records Dolphins/Braves fans would want to break. Maybe the game against the Jags was a little worse considering Marino is a Fins legend and McCann isn’t quite a Braves legend, but getting blown out in a playoff game to finish your career is awful.",baseball
"Yeah I figured. There’s really no getting past that one. It’s so hard to keep a Super Bowl window open, and it’s not like the Falcons have much of a history of consistently contending anyway. They were so good that year, and they did absolutely everything they could to just throw it all away.",baseball
"one bad inning man......before that it had been such a great, evenly matched series

Braves fans should feel proud of their team, regardless. And Ill say it, theres always next season.

The window feels wide open and I can see them dominate the NL East for awhile. (Sry Phillies/Nats/Mets/Marlins) 

As a Tigers fan, Ill be waiting for a loooong time for my team to come back into contention so Im just gonna be happy for others.",baseball
"I’m a cardinals fan and I agree with some of this, but most of you guys that are cards fans are way to negative.  Martinez, while he hasn’t been great, has a lot of talent and there is definitely reason to keep him on the team.

"Ok. Maybe I should make what I'm saying more clear. 

A) Why would there be a ""group of female reporters""? Do reporters in the locker room or clubhouse group themselves by gender? There should be female reporters and male reporters, or as I like to call them: reporters. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me that there was a group of female reporters. 

B) Ok. So let's say there actually was a group of female reporters. So what? They were reporters in a locker room or clubhouse. Why do we need to know what their specific gender was? Unless, of course, female reporters should be treated differently than male reporters. 

C) The reason I brought up what happened with the Mets is to illustrate that these types of things happen with reporters and players/staff in locker rooms and clubhouses.  The question is, why is it not that big of a deal when it happens with males  but is a huge job-ending controversy when it happens with females?

D) Look, I'm not actually trying to defend this guy. It sounds like he was being a dick. But my point is, so what? The guy was being a dick. This isn't the first or last time some player or staff member is going to be a dick to reporters. Why does it have to turn into such a huge controversy that this man has to lose his job? I'll tell you why: gender politics. And I simply don't feel that this incident rises to the level where anyone needed to be fired. People are acting like this guy whipped out his dick and started waving ot at them. That didn't happen. He simply expressed his feelings in an albeit dicky kind of a way. Which has happened on many different occasions on sports, it doesn't mean anyone needs to be fired. 

E) If we're going to have true equality then it actually needs to be equality. In my opinion it can't be a case where everyone is worried about women being offended by something a man says.  Some man says something you don't like? Oh well, that's his stupid opinion. That man shouldn't be fired for his stupid opinion because it offends women the same way he doesn't get fired because it offends men. And if we are going to have different standards then that is NOT equality. That is a special circumstance. And I do not feel that we're actually doing a service to women by doing this. We're simply engaging in a political mode of speech and action that is false and doesn't help anyone. 

And in a nutshell, that's what I'm saying. I believe this entire incident is a non story.  But of course it isn't. Some guy lost his job over this silly shit.",baseball
"He stopped moving like a second and a half before the ball lands. ""By rule"" the infield fly rule is called when an infielder can make a play on the ball under ordinary effort.

I get scoffed when I talk about players I want from other teams (“the Cubs are never giving up Bryant and Rizzo, they ARE the Cubs”) yet the Indians are being pressured to trade our star. So sick of my team being a farm system for everyone else.",baseball
"The way I’d look at it is this: if the Nationals save Scherzer for tomorrow, let’s say they have a 40% chance to win tonight with Strasberg and then a 40% chance to win tomorrow night. If they use Scherzer tonight, maybe they have a 50% chance to win tonight, but only a 30% chance to win tomorrow night, as Scherzer might not be as sharp and certainly won’t be able to go as deep. 

40% • 40% = 16% chance to win the WS

50% • 30% = 15% chance to win the WS

So the better chance to win the overall World Series is to have the 40% chance to win in both games, rather than increasing that number in game 6 at the cost of decreasing your chance to win in game 7. These numbers obviously aren’t perfectly accurate, but I think they’re reasonable and give a good example of the Nationals’ thought process.",baseball
"Hmm, do we keep Stras in for the 7th? He's at 86 pitches thru 6 so not super high, but his fastball velocity has seemed to drop a bit. Still he is facing the bottom of the order, I think I risk it. Maybe have a lefty for Redick but they'll probably put a righty in in that situation.",baseball
"I had to run a word count on this. 807 words, 4235 characters. I give it at least a B+, mostly because internet slang used. Definitely an A for an internet essay

I've still gotta agree, it's not clear cut either way. There are just things Gary did that didn't make sense to me and I'm still convinced the ump was calling it a strike instead of foul initially, but even with it nothing adds up clearly.

&gt;it's just not something you argue because as the hitter you already know what happened

This one's definitely something I've done in HS and college games, but it's obviously way different when you've got millions watching and judging you with cameras at every angle. I have no idea how these guys feel about trying to sell a call. There's also the catcher/ump relationship since it is Sanchez we're talking about here. If he tries to sell to the ump, the ump is definitely going to realize what happened after the game and view Gary differently. I have no idea how much any of this actually comes into play.

I would say I'm glad I got you to suspicious, but really it doesn't matter. It was a fun discussion. Hope the Yankees get back into it tomorrow, this series is fun.",baseball
"God, that debate should have been dead after Trout's rookie season. I can't believe it was reignited seriously after Harper won a single MVP.

I know I’ll get bashed for being a homer, but there needs to be something in place to challenge just absolutely terrible ball/strike calls in the playoffs (or just World Series), but it should have limits. It’s the 21st century and we have entire crews that can instantly be rewatching the plays. It shouldn’t take more than a few seconds, and if you limit the number of challenges it shouldn’t be too crazy.   

The entire game can, and has the last two nights, change based off a single shitty call. Looking at incorrect call % is nonsense. Even if they only get say 3 calls wrong in the game. If those calls came late in a close game and prevented an inning from ending, that is worse than having a bunch more incorrect calls early on or when the game is beyond salvageable. Either way, something needs to get done. I’ve thought this before it was just my team getting the ass end of some of the more timely bad calls. But this is the fucking pinnacle of the season, it shouldn’t get drastically impacted like this by a few terrible calls at the absolute worst possible time. These are the two best teams, it’s going to be close. Timely blown calls are massively impactful.",baseball

"That's correct. Right up through the 1882 season foul tips and foul balls caught on the fly OR the bound (one hop) were outs. In the winter of 1882 it was decided that pitches could be thrown from above the waist instead of tossed from below. With the change in delivery and obvious speed up of the ball, foul bounds were eliminated. In the winter of 1894 it was decided that foul tips caught by the catcher were no longer outs and instead became classified as strikes. It wasn't until after the turn of the century that foul balls became strikes, with the american league adopting first in 1903, though foul bunts had been strikes since the spring of 1894.",baseball

""The lines marking the three-foot lane are part of that ""lane"" but the interpretation to be made is that a runner is required to have both feet within the three-foot lane or on the lines marking the lane. If the runner straddles either boundary line running the last forty-five feet to first base, he is outside the lane. The batter is permitted to exit the three-foot lane by means of a step, stride, reach or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base for the sole purpose of touching first base. However, a batter-runner who runs to first base in fair territory ignores the three-foot lane violates the spirit of the rule and would be out if he interferes with the fielder **any distance from the base.**""

Emphasis is NOT my own. Emphasis is in there. The reason for this rule, as I learned in a lecture is that even if he is safe he interferes with Altuve's ability to catch the ball, and resulted in getting himself &amp; his teammate an extra base.

There has been absolutely nothing unusual about this World Series except the confluence of technology, the stupid K-zone box they shove down our throats, one team with excellent catchers, one team with poor catcher.

Bull ducking shit I say. When the game is about momentum and tough situations 1 team absolutely benefits more with context. 

Of course the nats could hit better but how the fuck is it possible if the strike zone is complete garbage. 

Fucking stupid logic man",baseball
"Serious question, but does anybody else think the Nats might've had a chance if the ump wasn't so bad tonight?  I want to be fair, and i think he really killed some big moments for the Nats tonight.  It sucks, but it happens.  I'm just curious what others think.",baseball

"Yeah if you’re gonna complain about the strike, just realize it was a strike the pitch before. 

Sure a bad call doesn’t make up for a bad call, but the outcome of the game doesn’t change from if the ump called the first pitch a strikeout vs the next pitch, so same diff in my mind",baseball
"If he is between you and the plate, you most certainly can. That would be a silly rule. What you can't do is go out of your way to hit him. Like I said, the purpose of the rule was to get rid of blind side hits. Ironically, the Buster Posey Rule could not have saved him.",baseball

The lineup is not as deep as the Astros or Yankees, but Turner, Rendon, and Soto are all great players. Howie Kendrick and Robles have stepped up, and Eaton is potentially regaining his form.

This team is hot at the plate, and the bullpen hasn't been atrocious in the playoffs. Put it all together, and they're pretty evenly matched with both the Astros and the Yankees.",baseball

Then people have to post ""Come on, they were on steroids"" then around and around forever.  I just honestly don't get the motivation people have to even consider these stats. They're all fucked up. Yeah, they're crazy numbers - but they're that crazy for a very clear reason. 

I mean, nobody is going around like ""Can you all believe Lance Armstrong won 7 in a row?""  I guess the difference is that Armstrong admitted it, but still - we all know these guys were doing steroids. It's ridiculous we even treat these numbers like they're real. It sucks that they exist in the record books, but at the very least fans should do the game a service and stop comparing them to normal numbers.",baseball

Would it be worth it spending a few million on a couple of bullpen arms or a bench player that may not really be worth it, or would it be worth it taking that few million, and using that to pay minor leaguers a little bit more, maybe be the thing that convinces a player or two to stick around, make the major league roster, and maybe be of benefit?",baseball

Not even close to finishing with my shopping I jump in line behind him trying to figure out a way to talk to him without being creepy, despite the fact I already stalked him through half of the store.  One of the managers was working the register is from Tunisia and a big soccer fan, so I’m always chatting with the guy.  “Ahmed, do you know who he is?”  He didn’t have a clue but he figures he’s an athlete and starts rattling off all of the Washington Wizards he’s seen in the store.  Max seemed genuinely surprised this store feeds so many pro athletes and asked Ahmed who the biggest star he’s met.  I cut Ahmed off and said, “that’s easy.  Max Scherzer” and Scherzer was so humble he actually blushed.  Ahmed asked him for his Safeway number and Max just shook his head.  I understood his point;  What’s a couple of dollars to a millionaire?  So I said, “Max, type 7035555201 and press Enter”.  The highlight of my year was the time Max Scherzer used my phone number and saved $3.25 at Safeway, all because I was a creepy stalker.

You can pick up Basketball by literally having a basket and a ball. Baseball you need a bat a ball and like 3-4 other people at minimum plus bases that aren't rocks.

"The Pine Tar Incident is probably the most infamous example. Basically, George Brett hit a go-ahead homer in the top of the 9th with 2 outs while using a bat that had too much pine tar. Billy Martin knew this and pointed it out to the umpires who then called Brett out thus negating the home run and handing the game to the Yankees. 

The Royals protested and the MLB upheld the protest because the point of the pine tar rule wasn’t to prevent some sort of unfair advantage but rather to limit the amount of baseballs that have to be discarded after being hit with a pine tar covered bat.",baseball
"It also forces Verlander and Cole to pitch in Games 2 and 3, and assuming normal rest, Games 6 and 7. 

Which is better than seeing those 2 like the Yankees saw Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling in the 2001 WS and pretty much see them every other game. Imagine seeing JV and Cole in Games 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7? 

I still wouldn't underestimate Zack Greinke though.",baseball
"your reasoning is quite farcical. 

The human element is created by the players, and they're the most important part of the game. I watch the game to see players do extraordinary things. I don't watch baseball to see the umpires influence the game through incorrect calls. The role of the umpires is to regulate the game correctly. They aren't doing that today, and when an obvious solution exists, the mlb hasn't adopted it.

The players are not impacting by switching over to robo-umps at all. Instead, they get consistently correct calls, which is what they want. 

The only component of the strike zone that is variable is the height. The width never changes nor does the depth of the strike zone.",baseball
"While I would have left him in, Hinch had Harris, Cole, and Osuna ready to go. Greinke had pitched deeper in the game than he’s been used of late. Forget the pitch count. He’s warming up more times than he’s used to. That matters. He’s also seeing the lineup for the third time and they had just gone HR and walk. 

If he stays in and gives up another couple of hits, Hinch would get killed for leaving him in too long.

If Harris does his job - as he has for basically the entire postseason - they are set up nicely for Cole to pitch the 8th, and Osuna for the 9th. It’s a solid strategy that just didn’t work out. 

Even if it’s a 50/50 choice, it’s still a solid strategy.",baseball
Great point! But I talking about from a batters point of view. Harder pitches to hit also the mound is closer that before and exactly the relief of pitchers to a new one makes it harder for batters to adjust when they were getting warmed up from the previous pitcher.,baseball

"Turner gave as much of a throwing lane as any righty hitter, and the only reason this play was a problem is that Gurriel made a terrible play and the throw was into foul territory. If Gurriel has the correct foot on first base ([https://imgur.com/cRSc4Dr](https://imgur.com/cRSc4Dr)), he catches this ball behind Turner without an issue. Gurriel's glove has to reach the foul line to make that catch, Turner is gonna hit his glove no matter where he's running because he has to be on the line to touch the base. The throw came from like 30-40 feet away from the first base line, the angle Trea ran at shouldn't even be relevant on this play if the throw was anywhere close to accurate.",baseball
"I might not have been clear.  

I was trying to say that if the umpire had called normal runner's interference (under 6.01(a)(10)), rather than relying on him being out of the lane, that would have required intent.

I agree that 5.09(a)(11) does not require intent.  But the only coherent way I could interpret Torre once he said it wasn't about the lane, was that he was saying it was a straight interference call, that could have been made on any runner.

Now they all hate him and talk trash nonstop, while I'm the one saying he's actually pretty decent that it's hard to blame him for choosing a much better offer. Sports fans, especially homers, can be ridiculous!",baseball
"I feel kind of bad for Brad Ausmus to be honest. So many things stacked up to make it impossible for him to salvage this season, and he was sacrificed on a bed of flames for it. I wouldn't say he was absolutely horrible, but you can only take so many setbacks before it's hopeless. :/",baseball
"From the rulebook:

In running the last half of the distance from home base to first base, while the ball is being fielded to first base, he runs outside (to the right of) the three-foot line, or inside (to the left of) the foul line, and in the umpire's judgment in so doing interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first base, in which case the ball is dead; except that he may run outside (to the right of) the three foot line or inside (to the left of) the foul line to avoid a fielder attempting to field a batted ball; Rule 6.05(k) Comment: The lines marking the three-foot lane are a part of that lane and a batter- runner is required to have both feet within the three-foot lane or on the lines marking the lane. The batter-runner is permitted to exit the three-foot lane by means of a step, stride, reach or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base for the sole purpose of touching first base.",baseball
"As someone who enjoys reading /r/bestoflegaladvice and is absolutely not a lawyer: nah, he doesn't have a wrongful termination case. Texas (like most of the US) has at-will employment, he can be fired at any time for any reason except for membership in a protected class, such as race or gender (eg. it would be illegal to fire him for being a white man, but that's not what happened here lol). Even if there's something in his contract saying he can't be fired without cause, they do have a very solid reason to fire him in that he damaged the organisation's reputation by acting like a dick and lying about it.

Maybe he'll automatically get some sort of payout, that might be part of his contract. But I can't imagine what he could successfully sue for, and there's no way he'd even try to sue if he ever wants to work in MLB again.",baseball
"This isn't a philosophy class.

The thought that you cannot judge others because of how they act in public, once or a million times, is ridiculous.

You think that he was just that ""one time racist,"" and he just happened to be caught making a racist gesture and saying a racist word during that one time slip-up? The idiot had multiple cameras on him. 

But why would care anyway? By your own admission, you and your friends have ""slight subconscious racist tendencies.""

Seriously, are you bullshitting me right now?",baseball
"I think you missed the point of what I was saying, and simultaneously illustrated it perfectly. The spirit of my comment was about the attitude of the fan base produced by (mostly distant) past success, and you went high effort to prove how great that (mostly distant) past success really is. Ok, great. The original point still stands. The entitlement attitude of the Yankees fan base is what makes the Yankees more disappointing than the Dodgers. That was my thesis and it stands. Entitlement always leads to disappointment. Gratitude doesn’t.",baseball
"I appreciate it. I’ll tuck the apology next to my Nats World Series champs pennant ��  I hope tomorrow goes as well as the World Series for you! Based on your comments and demeanor, I’m sure it will lol. You just need to hit 23 or 24 and you’ll figure it out bud.",baseball
"As I’ve said, the Astros are the poster-child of the domestic violence problem in professional sports. No facet of their decision-making team is exempt from this. Once the Osuna decision was made, the line in the sand that basically said the Astros are a safe haven for abusers of any kind so as long as the abusers provide value, was drawn. This is their legacy now until someone does something more to fix the Astros’ systemic problem.",baseball
"I was really rooting for you guys in '06 after we got bounced by the Tigers.   That may actually be the closest (one inning away from facing a Detroit team that fell apart).   I didn't want to mention the current Mets run because I'd probably get downvoted to death because of my flair, but it was the first thing that came to mind listening to the Brewers fans.   Hopefully things can trend up for you guys next year.",baseball
"I think calling that running lane violation is against the spirit of the game and that rule completely. In the end it doesn’t matter. Joe Torre said he was called out for interference, not a running lane violation (which is also technically interference but Torre said it wasn’t because of the running lane). Which, to me, makes the call that much more crazy.",baseball
"That’s not what I’m talking about. That’s closer to the ‘robo-ump’ others are referring to, which generates calls. 

Whereas what I’m suggesting distinctly leaves the authority of the call with the ump. I mean an umpire would wear transparent [Augmented Reality] glasses which superimpose a strike zone over home plate. This zone would be ‘anchored’ using physical markers, which transmit positioning data, actively informing the AR glasses where the zone exists in space from pitch to pitch, across all innings; so that the zone is no longer an ‘amorphous blob’ which the ump must superimpose/imagine mentally. 

Since the glasses are see through, the ump can still see the position of the ball. They will just have a more consistent visual frame of reference with which to determine their call.",baseball
"Mainly bc going from a windup (shoulders square to the plate) helps some guys time themselves, speed up/slow down their delivery and focus. Vs from the stretch, your whole motion is quicker to the plate (which is why pitchers switch to it with runners on), and your mechanics are simpler. 

Some people swear pitching from the windup gives you a little more velocity but I’m not sure. I always went from the stretch no matter what, I just like having next to no motion to go through, just kick, stride and follow through was easier. It’s mainly just preference at this point.",baseball
"There is always a chance but JUST signing Cole would boost our payroll to likely 245-250 million. That wouldn’t even include the existing needs at catcher which even if we just keep the current duo move that number to 255-260M. 

There are not really any pieces we can move elsewhere to clear the money; no team will touch Reddick’s 15M, for example. We would almost certainly have to trade Greinke or JV to make a run at Cole. 

So I mean.. it *is* possible but extremely unlikely. We could decide that Springer is 100% walking after next year and know that with his, Brantley, and Reddick’s money all leaving the books we would go back under the tax moving forward and then it becomes a question of would we spend near 250M even just for one season to keep Cole around? 

I’d love to see it and god knows Crane can afford it but it’s not at all realistic sadly",baseball
"Nick Markakis has been a remarkably solid and consistent outfielder for a decade and a half. He was one of the most effective players in the AL during his prime. 2018 was the first time was an all star and the first time he received an MVP vote.

He did get his third gold glove though.",baseball
"It'll get ignored because of my flair, but this whole situation is kind of..off.

There's no real context on SI's side. The timing is also a little suspicious, because who waits three days to out something like this when it'd usually hit Twitter in triplicate in practically seconds? How did this not get out by now?

As far as Osuna, he isn't good, or bad, he just is. Domestic violence is bad, and we can all agree on that. But I am not - and have never been - for sports organizations trying to take the place of the court system. He was suspended automatically, and he served it, which is fine. But more than that? Nope.

It's a case where all we know is that there was an accusation, and it was apparently ""he said/she said"" enough that even the prosecutor didn't believe they had a case. That's pretty much *all* we know, because details on it are sealed because of the way Canada's laws work.

I'm all for weeding out the abusers, criminals, and the like, but I'm not willing to ban a guy for life or avoid the fact he exists just because he *might* have done something.",baseball
"A foul tip can occur at any time during the count, and therefore could be any strike. A foul tip is considered such if the catcher holds onto the ball, otherwise it's a foul ball. This is important in two strike counts...if the ball if foul tipped and the catcher doesn't hold on, the PA continues; if the catcher does hold on, it's strike 3.",baseball
Okay now this is getting silly. They fired him. They fired him a few days later. The Astros organization is embarrassed. I get wanting them to fire Osuna but other than that there shouldn’t be “a steeper price.”  Even if they do let him go people will still be angry and we’ll still have articles like this. People are addicted to being outraged and reacting angrily on social media to things these days. It’s not good.,baseball
"I know people hate on the Yankees for being the Evil Empire but *this* Yankees team I felt was different. The fact that they made it to where they did with the enormous amount of injuries they had is pretty incredible.   

This team isn't like the late-90s-00s Yankees where every position was a star. No ARod, Jeter, Teixeira, Posada, Damon, Matsui, Giambi, Clemens, Rivera (tho who hates Mo, honestly), etc. There are a lot of players on this team, especially due to the aforementioned injuries, that are relative unknowns to much of baseball.",baseball
"Back when Astro’s were in NL, I respected the Killer B’s despite being a diehard Cardinals fan.  It was amazing getting Lance Berkman for 2 years, and we gave him is only World Series ring (w/a lot of his help of course, he saved us in G6 vs Texas Rangers).  I hope he makes into the HoF.",baseball
"Here's my take on Suero, and you can also put Rodney and Strickland in this category. If I'm managing, those guys have exactly one very limited place they can be used, which is to come in with no one on base. Suero and Rodney in particular have shown themselves to be either pretty good, or really bad, and the key to which one is if they can put the ball over the plate. The second they start nibbling they walk a guy. Then another one. Then someone gets into a hitter's count and it's game over. So - no one on base. If they walk a single batter, they have to come out IMMEDIATELY. Davey has to use them, but ONLY in the right situations and he HAS to have a quick hook because those guys have EARNED that quick hook by their performances all season long.",baseball
"Yeah man, how could a team ever beat expectations? Never. Imagine if like, a team was the underdog in three World Series' in a 5 year span. They'd walk away with zero, every time. You might as well put 2 checkmarks on the other team because that's a sure thing.",baseball
"The Dodgers bullpen also has done a very poor job stranding inherited runners from Kershaw in his postseason starts over the years.

2013 NLCS Game 6- Bullpen allowed all three inherited runners from Kershaw to score

2015 NLDS Game 1- Bullpen allowed two inherited runners from Kershaw to score

2016 NLDS Game 4- Bullpen allowed all three inherited runners from Kershaw to score

2017 World Series Game 5- Bullpen allowed all two inherited runners from Kershaw to score

2018 World Series Game 2- Bullpen allowed all two inherited runners from Kershaw to score

If the Dodgers bullpen had locked it down instead of imploding in those situations, Kershaw's postseason ERA would be quite a bit lower.",baseball
"A quote isn't a discussion. It's not a mic drop moment where you can just ignore the argument you are debating against. It's a quote. Quotes can be taken out of context and they don't apply to every situation. 

You obviously have a really black and white outlook on morality usually found in religous fundamentalism. 

Let me ask you this. What actions would Yuli Gurriel must take to convince you he's not a ""racist""?

Repeated patterns are more indictive of human behavior that one off gestures.",baseball
"No problem, you always remember those moments you fall in love with something.  When that ball went through Buckner's legs I remember celebrating like I was a Met's fan as I was taunting my Brother who was a Red Sox fan.  Even then my desire for happiness from the Sox misfortune was already strong.",baseball
"The Astros are now tied with a handful of teams from the Division Series Era for most games played in a single postseason (18). Off the top of my head I know of the 2001 Yankees, the 2011 Cardinals, and the 2017 Astros who played one less than the maximum number of games. No team has gone 5-7-7 yet.",baseball
"Pitchers: Scherzer, Verlander, Sanchez, Porcello, Price, Some relievers I guess (Joba Chamberlain and Phil Coke were with the Tigers in 2014 and the Yankees in 2009, Jose Veras was briefly on the Yankees in 2009 and the Tigers in 2013, Joe Nathan was the 2014 Tigers' closer and pitched 3 games for the 2016 Cubs)

Hitters: Cabrera, J.D. Martinez, Infante, and also Jose Iglesias played a couple months for the 2013 Red Sox",baseball
"Thanks for the laugh.  Tho as a Blues fan...even tho STL beat TBL in their matchups last season (I believe we were the only team to beat TBL twice last year; and the first...and one of only two teams to shut em out altogether)...that said, I’m still glad we didn’t have to face Tampa in the Cup Finals.  Much easier to hate on Boston’s Le Rat, vs hating on such gifted scorers that Tampa has (plus, having been stationed in FL, I have a fondness for underperforming FL teams, except the Marlins, Fuck em for always tanking and sandbagging the city/fanbase).",baseball
"The Devil Magic refers to the weird, bullshit ways that the Cardinals have managed to advance in the playoffs, whether that's benefitting from strange calls (the infield fly), having wild comebacks (the 2012 NLDS, slapping Kershaw in the 2013 and [2014 postseasons](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN201410030.shtml), obvi the 2011 World Series), or getting huge contributions from literal nobodies (Kozma, Skip Schumaker--Adron Chambers, where you at!?).

It's essentially a reference to how frequently we not only win (er... *used* to win...), but we win through some seeming otherworldly levels of bullshit.",baseball
The Astros need to come out with a vengeance tonight. The Nationals are getting too comfortable and the Astros are just too talented of a team to let that happen. Gonna have to see them get through to Anibal Sanchez tonight and not let him find his rhythm because he’s dangerous when he does.,baseball
"I don't know the guy so I won't question his sincerity, but even if your apology is a fake apology, make it look more like this.  

* Ownership for the action
* Showing some sort of acknowledgment for why it would be upsetting to people.
* Not taking the ""I'm sorry if you were offended"" approach. 

Alright, dude.  We can be cival.",baseball
"Okay, sign me up for all of Juan Soto. 

Hits an absolutely ridiculous HR in the World Series, watches it go, mocks Bregman's dumb ass....is barely old enough to drink....

Shit, can you guys move to the AL? It would make my life so much easier.

Also, win Game 7. Please and Thank You.",baseball
"I say let the kids have a little fun, but would agree it shouldn’t be done in a manner to show up a pitcher, just in a manner to show their excitement for being guys in their early 20s hitting homers in the World Series like we all dreamed about doing.",baseball
"Even for a while after interleague play started it was more of a novelty.. a set period where you had interleague play during the season - not like it is now where it is mixed in throughout

I still remember when the switch came back in like 97 - it wasn’t a HUGE deal but it was pretty exciting especially for astros and rangers fans.  It was the first time you could see them play (cause you knew they werent BOTH making the WS lol)",baseball
"Somewhat similar as a scoreboard / games won meme, ‘33-4’ is a really popular (and quite old) one for them - from the 2005 Japan Series when the Hanshin Tigers was swept and clobbered by the Chiba Lotte Marines with a total score of 33-4. 

Dunno if they have a ‘blew a lead’ meme.",baseball
"people these days are super sensitive to anything, they smell a sense of meat and they latch on that shit for years. Wish we could go back to the 90s- early 2000s when everything dont get blown out of proportion. If he's accuse of that, let him serve his sentence and be done with it but nop, let's keep reviving a dead horse just to beat it to dead again.",baseball
"Keeping this in neutral ground, but I appreciate the Yankees fans that were in our park last night who were not sore winners. I honestly wasn’t expecting that. I didn’t hear heckling as I was leaving last night which is good because I would have just broke down right then and there. The few of you I interacted with yesterday were nice, and I’ve actually seen (both here and on Twitter) a lot of kind words from your side.  In my lifetime I’ve experienced pretty much the exact opposite which is where a lot of my disdain comes from, but many of you guys were really cool and I appreciate that. It was heartbreaking end to an otherwise really fun season and I look forward to competing with you guys next year. 

Best of luck.",baseball

"Yeah, I was shocked that Roberts did a double switch and had Kershaw pitch the eighth as well. He should have been used for Eaton and then pulled immediately. I don't know what's up with these managers who keep putting their starting pitchers in unfamiliar roles as relievers in the postseason. It seems like they've all been copying Bochy since he did it with Bumgarner in the World Series back in 2014. That was a one time situation though with a pitcher who was on a roll. I also believe the Giants bullpen was a little unreliable that year. That was not the case with this Dodgers team. Should have just relied on your rock solid bullpen to get six outs.",baseball
"well. who knows. if he goes in instead of kersh, maybe we are okay? who am i kidding. our offense was mostly dogshit. i know the cards were dogshit as well but i feel they would have woke up at the sight of ""Dodgers"" and their black magic playoff bullshit they always pull would have fucked us.",baseball
"I included that more for the marketing perspective of things.  Lord knows they cut to her on TV all the time during the playoffs.

I'm biased for sure, but it just seems silly to miss out on an opportunity for increased exposure when there's been so much talk about how baseball is falling behind other sports and doesn't market its stars or small market teams as well.",baseball
"If we do the right thing and draft some hitting this June, the ALC is going to turn into a bloodbath in the 2020s. The Twins and Indians are already good, the White Sox are developing great talent, we have an incredible crop of arms about a year away, and KC has new ownership that going to be motivated to win.",baseball
"Felix is not going into the Hall, no. Right now he is 224th in ERA among starting pitchers. 192nd in wins. If the voters are looking at more modern stats, then 132nd in ERA+, 109th in WAR and also in JAWS.  

He was a very good pitcher for a long time tho.",baseball
"On the Nats bandwagon! Here's why

Cause the WC meltdown of the Brewers with  a Hader blown save

Hand Dodgers fans another year without a ring in spectacular fashion, back to back bombs off of jesus christ himself, then slam to shut the door

1 game away from sweeping one of the worst offensive performances from the red birds

The only way I can see this being any sweeter would be to win it agaisnt Yankees in 5 games in the world series. 

Any word from Bruce Hooper?

Go Nats!",baseball
"Sadly, it's all pretty much the same shit.

Most Florida OJ is kept in tanks long past when the flavor is dead and gone, then doctored with chemicals and perfumes until it tastes ""like"" orange juice.

If you have orange juice that's actually squeezed from the fruit at the time, it tastes drastically different.",baseball
"if we win the WS you and I both know you'll be right there cheering them on

the whole thing sucks but I remember reading about this when Mcnair (texans owner) did his, ""inmates running the asylum"" comment, and it ultimately cost the texans nothing whatsoever.

not trying to be cynical, but people don't root for a team for 20+ years then change allegiance because of shitty PR and one bad dude",baseball
"On screen is “relatively” accurate, but it’s also only 2D and tracking the ball at the front of the plate where the strike zone is actually a 3D volume. So a lot of backdoor sliders and curves that look off the plate at the front may be sneaking back over the plate by the end.",baseball
"I’m sure you already know this, but mlb just gives the broadcast rights to whoever agrees to pay them the most money.  It would be nice if they took fam convenience into account, but that’s not even close to being the case.  That’s the same reason they play playoff games in the middle of weekdays.  It’s what the tv schedulers want.  Sorry if the fans have to work, maybe they can check the scores on their phones or something.

We are just a few years away from the World Series being an espn + exclusive or only on Hulu TV or something.",baseball
"Yeah this wasn’t meant to be a definitive thing saying these pitchers are bad, Keuchel obviously worked out well for the Braves this season (much better than Kimbrel)

I just found it funny they all had rough outings in a 2 game span.

I do think Keuchel is the worst of the 3 pitchers I mentioned however.",baseball
"It still doesn't make sense:

I did a quick search and found that Jared Weaver is the only 2016 AL  pitcher with at least 150 innings and an fWAR that was basically 0 (0.10  to be precise). His stats were: 5.06 ERA (79 ERA+), 5.62 FIP, and 5.21  K/9 on 178 innings. I get that there was parity at the top, but I'll say  that a great 2016 AL pitcher is worth more than 5.4 WAR.",baseball
"I doubt it tbh. I think it’s more about talent looking at the information. Some people are extremely good at pattern recognition. Bregman supposedly figured out the tip either in his first at bat or on base because he’s seen explaining it to people once he got back to the dugout. The concern with the cameras is that they are used to look at the catcher’s signs or the defensive signs. If that’s getting relayed to the bench then it’s cheating.

I will say astros put a lot of energy into this stuff. They just have an air of cheater about them in general. Not that other teams don’t, bust astros seem pretty god damn organized on this.",baseball
"The fact that she left the country and refused to testify is telling... it makes Osuna look worse. DV victims usually don’t (I’m guessing) based on their own shame and enmeshment with their abuser. Plus, he’s got more power than her and is the father of her kid. So she was beaten by him and in a stuck situation. Meanwhile he gets to keep going with little consequence. 

As you can see, I don’t take his sentence at face value and I don’t think anyone else should, either.",baseball
Love that arbitration is finally starting to catch up to FA salaries. A small change the union can fight for to drastically increase young player salaries is fight to change the system from 3 years minimum 3 years arb to 2 years minimum 4 years arb for every single player instead of only Super Two ones.,baseball
"Well if he were to opt for TJS now, he could possibly be back as early as June, that’s what happened with Didi.  If he plays through it and hope it heals this offseason there’s a chance he doesn’t re-injure.  But if he re-injures in the middle of the season it’s worst case scenario",baseball
Am I the only one surprised that as many as 11 teams have come back from a 2-0 deficit in the World Series? A 2-0 deficit is a major hole to dig out of. You would think that a team coming back from that deficit would have happened a lot less than 11 times.,baseball
I haven’t been to a Yankees game yet but so far my worst experience was at the Blue Jays game. The fans were really hostile for a non-divisional game in early April. Still I have a lot of east coast parks left to see and I’m sure they’ll be given a run for their money!,baseball
"&gt;Your fans just happen to be hyper aggressive for having won the most WS in the history of the sport, which just pisses everyone else off. It's really annoying dealing with either the elitist attitude, or super whiny attitude.

And 19 of those titles were won before 1960, before Expansion, before the Draft, before free agency. It's like bragging about your grandfather's accomplishments as though they were your own.",baseball
"I have umpired for 15 years.  That's 100% an infield fly.  You're not supposed to signal until it **becomes** ""ordinary effort"".

Kozma is running laterally to the spot. (Not an IFR.) Then he stops (still not an IFR).  Then he camps under it and calls it (now it's an IFR, hand goes up).  Then Holliday comes in charging like a moose and runs him off, and it drops.

It looks bad to the team it went against, and I sympathize, but it's without question a correct call of an infield fly.",baseball
"Exactly my point lol. Those are all great reasons to stay with the Angels, but none of those involve winning. 

This team is mediocre and will stay that way for a while, like it has for the past decade until the front office is cleared out again and you guys get a better core around Trout. 

I hate hearing this “you don’t know the Angels like we do” talk from Angels fans. Yes I do. I know the team has surrounded Trout with absolutely nothing (and when they do, it’s a bad signing) and don’t develop young talent all that well.",baseball
"&gt; The cost/benefit of telling the ump when they’re shit and getting ejected.

The cost is clear, and heavy, especially if it's one of your better hitters getting ejected. Less so if it's the manager, but still it's not a cost you want to pay to get nothing in return.  
&amp;nbsp;  
And that's the thing. There's a very good chance that you actually get nothing in return. I don't know if anyone has studied umpire ball/strike calls before and after an ejection to see if there is a pattern, if umpires really do favor the ejected player/manager's team on close calls after an ejection. I *strongly* suspect there is no such pattern. Umpires really are just calling it like they see it.  
&amp;nbsp;  
That means the only benefit you gain is the ""rile up your team"" benefit. But hell, this is the World Serious. There's no such thing as a team in the WS with players who are not fully motivated and engaged.",baseball
"You're absolutely right. I often point to Game 5 of the 2017 World Series. It was a truly epic game, one of the best ever. And it was on a Sunday. And yet they started the game at 8pm EST. The game was in Houston. I think it's safe to say the majority of people aren't working on a Sunday. Houston has a great following. They would've been at the stadium ready to rock at 4pm MT if you started the game at 6pm EST. How are we gonna get more young kids into baseball if the World Series games are starting like an hour (give or take) before their bed time? They end up missing instant classics. I'm not naive, I know it's about ratings and money. But the league has to know they're missing out on potential fans.

I haven’t read many comments but I don’t think we are playing good enough for us to even have salt. The Yankees were not expected to win this series and we’ve proven why. What hurts the most is how well we played in the ALDS and then game one this series before deciding to stop playing baseball.,baseball
"Do you remember Jose Contreras, a pitcher for the Yankees? He was a Cuban pitcher that was hotly contested especially between the Yankees and Red Sox and so the Red Sox scouted him heavily with the intention of signing him. The Yankees “won” and signed him. Look at his starts against the Red Sox in 2003 and 2004 as a Yankee. They absolutely rock him repeatedly, it is a catalyst for the Yankees trading him to the White Sox. Turned out when he threw his splitter he would wiggle his glove while he was gripping the ball and when he threw his fastball he wouldn’t and because the Red Sox scouted him they knew this. The White Sox fix him and while he isn’t throwing CGSO’s the rest of his career vs Boston (he was 31 in his “Rookie year” so he hits a normal age-related decline in his mid-30’s) he makes representative starts.",baseball
"Those 24 front offices that passed on Trout probably feel a lot of regret on that draft. Although I'm sure many of them would say ""With the information we had at the time, we still would have made the same call because we had no way of knowing how good Trout was going to be.""",baseball
"&gt; How does a team get 107 wins with 3 starting pitchers?

With a historically good offense. 

I know most fans focus on their own team, rooting for their 1 - 2 All-Stars and don’t really spend much time checking other team’s stats. (I did this for years during the Biggio and Bagwell years.) But this Houston lineup is incredible with 7 All-Star caliber players. And on a lot of nights, even the #8 or #9 batters come through with clutch hits.

"I understand what you're saying but we've been down that path before with him. Hillsborough County came up with a plan last year that would have split the  cost 50/50 on their new stadium. 

Stu said no and had said that the Rays were intiallly looking to contribute around $150 million to a $900  million project.

Yeah Philly is a big market team and can spend a lot of money because of it. Idk why you think that's a gotcha. The Athletics have revenues between $210-220 mil. Big market teams can run payrolls larger than that. No billionaire is spending their own money on a team and you don't buy teams to lose money.,baseball
I would love to see TB beat out HOU but they’re going to have to put up more of a fight against Greinke and Cole than they did against Verlander. Even if they don’t score off the starter they need to get him out of the game sooner. The Astros bullpen is their weakness.,baseball
"You can't find a million dollar arm just lying around. Frat bros turned into upper middle management are a time a dozen.

I've never disagreed with anyone who accused Yadi of being a bit hotheaded from time to time.  He can be.  But he picks his battles and doesn't fly off the handle for no reason.

Obviously, this is a very dumbed down paraphrased version of what really happened, but the general consensus seems to be that Maddon was asked to manage in a way that’s different to his own managing style, and that can never go well.

"Managers are overrated. Sure, a good one will help out. Sure, a bad one might hurt a team. But I bet every team could have replaced their current manager with their 3rd base coach or bench coach at the start of the year and the results would have finished about the same (assuming the same luck).

I think hiring/firing managers are more a PR/marketing thing as opposed to anything else. I would guess the best manager in the game is worth maybe a couple or few wins per season if quantified.",baseball

"It absolutely is when evaluating players. 

ERA also isn't great b/c you don't control for

1. Park effects (2.00 ERA at Coors =/= 2.00 ERA at AT&amp;T Park)

2. Defense 

3. some pitchers can control their BABIP well, most can't. 

If you want to measure by runs given up, then go for RA9-WAR on fangraphs or bWAR

If you want a rate stat that compares all ERAs equally, then look at ERA+ (100= league avg after adjusting for park effects, and any number above that is the pct better than the league avg)

WHIP again is a stat only relevant for Fantasy. 

You want a WHIP equivalent? Look at OBP against. But that also doesn't measure the *quality* of the hits given up - after all, a single isn't the same as a homer. 


So then we come back to WAR.",baseball
I am not a fan of Davis either and Anderson is good to me. I watch a lot of Met games so I hear Ron Darling often and for some reason he was different in the post season this year.

"JD Davis is extremely overrated. He is a butcher in the field and is bound to regress from the rate he was Hitting at.

And I actually called diaz possibly being a lot worse (not this bad but still), and I said cano would be outperformed by jay bruce at the time. I also said dunn would reach the majors and kelenic reach A+ (AA) along with swarzak being good. (He was good in medium/high leverage situations). Also relievers are very volatile and not of the same value as position players so the soto comparison makes zero sense. And the cano contract is gonna hamstring is pretty badly.

"You have to tag the base you were at after the catch is made. So the Yankees guy was at second and didn't run very far because it looked like the ball would be caught. When it was caught he went back to second, tagged it, then sprinted to 3rd to beat the throw.",baseball
You have to wait for the ball to be caught (or go back to the base) before you can try to advance. Sanchez waited at 2nd before taking off for 3rd. Bregman was already 2/3rds of the way to 2nd when the ball was caught and didn't make it back in time.,baseball
It’s not easier but the argument would be that you can get a better lead and jump going to 3rd.

It would have been harder for the Warriors to get all those stars if Durant was being offered way more money else where. Right now, the biggest stars are underpaid and the role players are overpaid.

"The year is 2029.

Long after having been forgotten by the mainstream media and casual fan, Clayton Kershaw barely makes a postseason roster as a mid reliever.

But then he shockingly catches fire. He can’t miss his spots. Unhitable.

He gets the save in all three game for round one with 8 strikeouts. No walks.

In round two, he comes out of the pen once again and earns two saves while allowing zero runs and striking out six. He is easily the mvp.

Then in the big dance. The memories of his postseason struggles re-emerge. That’s all the media has to talk about. Will he be used again?

In game two, barely holding a one run lead, Kershaw is summoned from the bullpen. The league MVP at the plate and runners on second and third.

But there is not a prayer.

One down.

Two down.

Three down.

All the world is abuzz but despite Kershaws efforts, the series goes to seven.

After a 17 inning marathon in game 6, there is only one answer. Only one available pitcher. The former legend who has re-emerges with awe-inspiring grandeur.

Clayton Kershaw.

He strikes out the side to begin the game.

He cruises along and somewhere around the 6th inning, there is buzz that he’s got a perfect game going.

One by one, the champions of the American League have no answer.

To the 9th.

But through the 9th.

The score is 0-0.

Kershaws fatigue shows but he is determined. To finally defeat the haunting demons of his earlier, hall of game career.

At the plate in the bottom of the 10th, with a perfect game intact, is the boy from Texas.

On an 0-2 count he gets a fastball.

He doesn’t miss.

And with the crack of the bat, a legacy of disappointment and failure evaporates.

The ball sails over the wall and the searies is over.

A walkoff home run to complete a perfect game 7.

In tears the 40 year old turns the corner at third. His teammates 90 feet away. He steps on the bag.

It’s over.

The stigma. The opinions. The haters. They have nowhere to go.

At the podium, Kershaw begins to break down.

“I wanted a ring, I couldn’t walk away with out it.”

He sobs through the presentation and turns toward the owner.

“When no one believed in me, you did. I’m so thankful for the opportunity!”

Then the team makes their way to the dugout and tunnel. Kershaw is the last.

He looks back to make sure it is all real.

He glances to the heavens and smiles.

He looks up at the board and grins.

It’s happened.

It’s real.

The scoreboard confirms it.

The San Francisco Giants have won the World Series.",baseball
"The rule also states he doesn’t have to be in the running lane in the immediate vicinity of first base, which Turner obviously was in the vicinity. Not being in the running lane didn’t affect the throw, so I don’t find it relevant.

"I never bought the narrative that the Astros were now invincible because they got Greinke, and I especially didn’t buy the narrative that the Dodgers would make it but lose for the third straight year.

"So it seems that ""interference"" call may have technically been correct. If so, the rule needs to be amended. My biggest issue is that it is completely unfair to a right-handed batter, who can't actually take a straight path to first base but instead has to take a slightly longer route to get into foul territory. Right-handers already have to take a longer route than left-handers, and I think any time a rule rewards bad fielding, it should be changed. I think it's particularly ironic that the offical rule talks about the ""spirit of the rule"" in regard to the runner but not the fielders. Maybe if it was a bunt down the first-base line, I'd agree that he has an obligation to get out of the way of the throw. But this was not that.",baseball

"Protests are two steps.  During the game, the manager has to let the umpire know he might protest so that the official scorer can keep track of the exact game situation at that point.

So if the protesting team wins, they just don't file it with the league.",baseball

What a bunch of BS. Couldn't do worse than Harris or Smith have. I hate the whole babying that commentators give to bullpen players. If you can't come in and get 10 good pitches through, you shouldn't be on a playoff-level team. The joke last night that Harris threw the HR pitch because he had to wait 5 minutes during the review.

The batter-runner is permitted to exit the three-foot lane by means of a step, stride, reach or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base for the sole purpose of touching first base.""

Against the yankees, it's essentially our series, but you guys have one extra starter, although a worse bullpen. The yankees obviously have a murderers row of hitters (I hate watching them grind pa's; every player can unload a bomb), but you guys are much hotter at the plate.

Overall, I'd say the Yankees are the tougher matchup rn due to the hitting and ability to unload the entire bullpen. Nonetheless, baseball is baseball, and your hot offense could be enough against both teams.",baseball

But when you start to talk unnecessary shit, that's when people start to slowly walk away.",baseball
"People blame the rule when reality is, the problem starts at the youth level. Players get taught to do this to try to make the throw harder and the play never actually develops this way so they keep doing it for decades until they finally get beaned by a throw and find out they've been breaking a rule for 15 years.

Especially in MLB you can probably go an entire career running like this and the defense will still make the play because they are very, very, very talented (It's why I watch MLB, they are really good). When it happens it is called almost every time.

It's not confusing at all. If you are in the runner's lane and there is a collision or interference the runner is fine. If you aren't then the runner is fucked. Very simple, easy, consistently applied rule.",baseball
"Many of his games are against just flat out bad teams. In the playoffs the margin for error is razor thin. A slider you can get away against a scrub doesn’t work in the playoffs. 


Love the guy but until he plays like Scherzer in the playoffs I’m not gonna be hip on him in the post season.",baseball
"So, I missed the end of the game for some work bullshit, but on the way home, some national sports radio guy (fox, I think) was talking about since the Nats won this game, it's proof not signing Harper was the right move. 

He went in to say that it just goes to show that you don't need to pay big money to players in baseball. 

Never mind that the two guys who pitched 8 innings of the game for the Nats cost about $400M and Rendon has been offered $200M. 

Anyway, fun game lol.",baseball
Baseball smarts is knowing the intricacies of the game. It’s why former players are managers and the Ivy League guys are in the front office. Alex Cora had one season of coaching baseball under his belt before winning the World Series last year. Experience is highly overrated in being an mlb manager.,baseball
"Every now and then I rewatch the 9/11 live news coverage and Dan Rather's commentary was prophetic, he posited that America as we knew it would change.

He was absolutely right, but that isnt a red or blue thing. The national security apparatus expanded greatly at the Federal and State level and it isnt going to give up its powers anytime soon.

The main divergence between Red and Blue states, and I'm not sure if you were avoiding the topic, has been action on gun rights. Blue states like CA and NY, to my dismay, have cracked down on gun rights in the wake of 9/11 and subsequent mass shooting incidents. 

While I think their objectives are noble, their reasoning is misguided and not grounded in facts. Long guns and so called ""high"" capacity magazines account for a tiny fraction of gun deaths nationwide. 

Expanded access to mental health, better schools and improved job prospects would do way more to reduce gun deaths than ban ""scary black guns with shoulder thingies that go up"" ever would.

Same as improved sex-ed and access to birth control does a way better job of reducing abortions than simply banning them.",baseball
"&gt; non-alcoholic beverages inside, right?

our stadium will only allow one sealed water bottle or an empty bottle. no other drinks. i hate that. i wish i could bring in a can of redbull to get though the second half of the game. but yah i will usually bring a sub and not buy food.",baseball
"So I would like to see the local broadcasters do the games in their home cities, BUT 1 Game 1, would be the TV guys from their local network, Game 2, would be their radio guys getting the call... 

I live in DC, and Bob Carpenter and FP Santangelo are great, Along with Charlie Sloughs and Dave Jaggler who are also great on the Radio. Both need 1 night to call the game on national tv...then the powers that be can decide on games 5-6-7. if it goes that far.",baseball
"I went to a game (at Suntrust) against the Phillies this past season and was right next to right field. Everyone was booing Harper but he took it like a champ and even gave a baseball or two to some young Atlanta fans. He seemed chilled out. I don't have any problems with him anymore, honestly.",baseball
"It doesn't help that the *fucking announcers* don't seem to have a handle on it either, adding to the confusion.  Which is weird, because it isn't that complicated?  Took me a few minutes of research, and I don't get paid for this shit lol.  Their job is supposed to be to help people understand what's happening, not make it worse...",baseball
"&gt;am still kind of salty about Ichiro beating him for ROY

CC had an ERA well over 4 (despite winning 17 games), and Ichiro was the MVP while leading the league in batting and steals, all while being the first Japanese position player in MLB history. I don’t think there’s much to be salty about (and if you’re wondering about WAR, Ichiro had him 7.7 to 2.8).",baseball
"When you talk about the best announcers PxP guys, especially who do multiple sports (Kevin Harlan, Ian Eagle, Al Michaels, etc.), it seems like Brian Anderson's name is never brought up, but he's just so solid.

He did all the Tennessee games in the NCAA Tournament, so on one hand, he called all the postseason games of two of my favorite teams after very successful years. But on the other hand, he also called them being eliminated...",baseball
"Do you guys think that the stingray knew it was going for the heart, or was it just an unhappy coincidence? Just how much do stingrays know about human anatomy? Do they practice attacks on human-shaped dummies? Is it our fault for dumping old mannequins in the ocean with the rest of the garbage? Are the Tampa Bay Rays terrorist sympatizers? More at 11.",baseball
"I'm not gonna lie, Tampa could have swept them and I'd still look back at that Pittsburgh OT winner as if it were my wedding day/birth of my first child. 

When they went down 3-2 against the Bolts that familiar sinking feel g was there, but somehow my spirits never went *all the way* down and once they won Game 2 against Vegas there wasn't much doubt. 

Here's to the Nats doing the same.",baseball
"It was obviously the right decision.  We didn't let Houston get any momentum going and finished out the shutout without even having to use Kahnle or Chapman.  Tanaka is well-rested and will still have the confidence of leaving on a high note after 6 dominant innings.  Like you said, our bullpen is more than capable of finishing 3 innings and against a team like Houston, you don't take any chances with your starter.",baseball
"Seriously it’s really unfortunate that an absolute piece of shit for a human being can ruin the moment for so many wonderful people like Tuve that have no control over what some spoiled cluster b asshat says in some drunken tirade. I hope they right the ship here and crucify this fucker for the piece of shit that he is. Would love to dump Osuna as well, I’m constantly disgusted to see him on the mound and all the hot trash he brings with him. Also just upset at all sports in general in how they handle these situations, it’s apparent in every organization in every sport around the globe. 

Makes me realize how much I hate people and love our dogs that much more.",baseball
"3 out of 5 of the last Yankees postseasons end with the Astros knocking them out.

In every postseason matchup between the Yankees and Astros they've lost. The Tigers are the only other AL team to do that, and they took one more year to get their 3rd victory. 

I feel confident in saying that the Yankees have officially earned 'little brother' status to the Astros.",baseball
"I'll never root for the astros but I'm rooting for the yankees if that finally brings us the DH. I'm not against our rules per se and I think it's more in line with the spirit of the game. However, seeing the AL play fun and exciting baseball while we have to deal with the tragedy of pitchers batting is just unfair. Both leagues should have the same rules, be it DH or not.",baseball
"I can respect that. But the dodgers championships in LA are from 59-88. The Giants have 3 this decade. 

The Dodgers are a much better team right now, but all that matters is championships. Look at the Golden State Warriors 73-9 record. Are they better than the 72-10 Bulls? Not a chance. Bulls were champs, Golden State was nothing. 

Winning in the regular season is cool, sure. But it comes down to winning it all.",baseball
"Has he ever come out to why he signed the deal? If family need money that bad and there is a signing bonus and the braves were just like ""that's all you get"". Was he lied to? Is he bad with numbers? The average arbitration eligible salary for 2b from the past years is 3-4 million whether they came to a deal or went to arbitration. With the max at 10+.",baseball
"This pitch is called a strike on a daily basis during the regular season, with a good frame of course. It catches a decent chunk of the plate and the only thing debatable is the height, which is where the framing comes into play. I think it crosses at the knees. If you don’t think it catches a decent chunk of the plate then you’re not taking into account the angle bias and where the catcher is set up. You’re also looking too much at the catcher and not at the ball and plate. You’re getting a view from the left center camera which makes inside strikes look even more inside. 

A game cast or pitch cast would have this on the bottom right corner where 50% of it is out of the zone and 50% is in the zone. And those pitches are strikes, plain and simple.

During the regular season I see tons of pitches that are strikes get called balls because the catcher just straight up gives up on the ball and can’t frame it, mostly due to where he was set up.",baseball
"&gt;54 ounces

This makes me wonder, is there a resource somewhere out there that catalogs all the power hitters in the history of the league with the details of the bats they used?

Like what kind of bat did McGuire use when he broke the single season HR record? What about Hank Aaron, was he consistent with his preferred bat-type over his entire career?

I think there are new depths to be explored here.",baseball
"I'm not sure we've bragged about it. If anything, seems like everyone close to the Astros has tried to quiet the conversation down, probably to keep it as more of a competitive advantage.

The one time they've gone out and said it was after the 2017 WS when they had already won and people asked about it and if Darvish had been doing it.",baseball
"The way I'm sorta kinda understanding it, this stat is not about that one single decisive swing, but the one that made it possible for it to even happen.  But then Maz's homer is there, so I don't know.  
As for Freese's homer, that was in Game 6 of a Series that went the full 7.",baseball
"I'll defend going with Harris over Cole with a runner on, honestly. I think the plan in Hinch's mind was to bring in Harris and have him close out the inning without giving up a run, something that'd he'd done plenty of times in the past, and then bring in Cole for the next inning, with plenty of time for the normally-starting-pitcher to get ready to go.

Remember, a pitcher's warm-up routine is different based on their role. Relievers need to get ready to go with their best stuff in a hurry, starters usually have a lot of time to get their best stuff online.

Look at 2014's Game 7. Hudson isn't sharp, he's getting into trouble early, and finds himself giving up 2 runs in the 2nd inning to tie the game, with 2 outs and a runner on 1st and 2nd.

Bochy will ***eventually*** go to his ace, sure, but in the meantime he brings in his best reliever, maybe the most underrated postseason pitcher of all time, Jeremy Affeldt, owner of a 0.83 ERA over 31.1 postseason innings pitched.

Affeldt gets out of the 2nd without any damage, and then the 3rd and 4th because he's that good. And then, at the start of the 5th inning, Bumgarner comes in to meet history.

I think this was a similar style of move, just with a shorter leash on Harris because it was later in the game. It just didn't work out for the Astros this time.",baseball
"We don’t have any words and we know you don’t want to hear them.  
  
We understand your anger, your frustration, your sadness. Everything you’re feeling – we get it.  
  
This isn’t the ending we imagined, and certainly not the one we wanted. Thank you for being there the entire way.",baseball
"I understand that, but from a teammates prospective it’s a bigger problem going forward than what happened tonight.   Losses happen, pros know how to let it go and move on to the next game.   Letting down your teammates though by not hustling, that shit gets addressed real quick, especially in the playoffs. Michael Jordan, for instance, would have beat acunas ass in the locker room if he pulled that on his team.

That said, there’s a lot of other things the media could be asking about.   Like why leave melacon in when his curveball was getting tattooed everywhere.   Most of the other stuff is execution errors, like kakes not going to the cutoff man immediately instead of hesitating on the throw (not that kakes noodle for an arm would have thrown Fowler out anyway).",baseball
"When the information we want to know is who the best player is,“real” outcomes are irrelevant if we can mathematically prove they are not outcomes driven by skill and rather driven by luck.

Earned runs allowed is just a proxy for pitcher skill because it was the best idea we could come up with when stats were being invented decades ago. The concept of an “earned run” isn’t self evident and is no more “real” than FIP. Both are completely made up terms with the same goal — mathematically showing who the best pitcher is. You just grew up reading about ERA so it seems more “real” and natural.. but it’s not. It turns out, runs allowed is not the best indicator of a pitcher’s ability like we previously thought.

Don’t forget, the concept of an “earned run” vs an “unearned run” was totally made up just like FIP and is just the first attempt at normalizing numbers against “real” outcomes driven by luck. By your logic, a run is a run so we shouldn’t discount runs scored via an error because that run “really” scored either way, right?

baseball stats have always adjusted reality to reduce down to true skill (e.g. sac flies don’t count against your batting average, GIDP doesn’t get credit for an RBI if a run scores, it’s not a hit it’s a reached on error, wild pitch vs passed ball etc.)",baseball
"Always one of the most interesting debates. I always felt that the result mattered more than the my perception of the thinking behind it. Even if I think the move was wrong going in, or even that conventional wisdom says it’s the wrong move, if it works out it works out. Because ultimately you have actual evidence of the action working out, seems strange to call it a “bad move.” Now what you can do is say that if the manager continue to make moves in that philosophy it won’t work out, and you’d probably be right. But you can ignore the result of an action. 

Always felt the same about trades. Like sure you can understand the reasoning behind Cashman choosing to trade for Gray instead of Verlander in 2017. And more often than not if he follows the reasons behind it for future trades he’s gonna come out on top more often than not. But for that specific event, he was dead wrong.",baseball
"It’s now official. Literally every single prediction I made for the playoffs are wrong. 100%
I picked Twins over Yankees. I picked As over Rags. I picked As over Astros (don’t ask why). I picked Dodgers over Brewers. I picked Braves over cardinals. I picked brewers over nationals. I literally could not have been more wrong. I’m ashamed to admit it. But I’m kind of pulling for the Nats now. No fun stories in the AL and the cardinals are a team full of babies who peg players for moving their feet a little too much when rounding the bases.",baseball
"When he’s been arguable the best regular season pitcher over the last decade, anything but the best feels like he’s letting you down. With a 4.32 ERA in the Postseason and a 2.44 ERA in the regular season, he just overall has not been his dominant self consistently. He has had some fantastic performances in post season games (2013 NLDS - 13IP 1ER 18K), but also fallen apart (2013 NLCS - 10IP 7ER 10K).",baseball
It’s fucking criminal the Rays have one of the best teams in the game and only 14K people a night see it. Figuring out a way to get better attendance numbers for one of the best teams in the game should be at the top of MLBs list of priorities,baseball
"I’m not sure you’re an NL fan, but there’s a huge difference between having a designated hitter who can stay the entire game, and having to choose between pitching, defense, and offense. To say the NL is at least 60% DH isn’t correct. There’s a huge difference between the DH batting fourth and me burning my bullpen and a solid defender to have a double switch so I skip the pitchers spot, or to take out a low hitting defender for a better hitter with a worse glove.",baseball
"I still don't care if you have a problem with me.  

A Klan member? Now you're just making crap up.

I have everything figured out because I don't like racists (yeah, I still believe that he's a racist, despite your great ""repeated patterns"" beliefs, which are ridiculous and wrong, but not religious) and domestic abusers? 

Yuli is always going to be seen as a racist by many. I can see that you desperately want to change that, but you can't.",baseball

Like was said above, pitchers can last a while unless they break. The fact that Verlander was able to make some adjustments and return to dominant does more to support the point that pitchers can last than it does to discredit it imo.",baseball
"The runner's lane doesn't start until halfway down the line, so you've got 45 feet as a right handed hitter to get from fair territory over to foul territory. The runner's lane is only 3 feet wide and the inner margin is the foul line and you should be trying to tag the outer half of the bag (for a lot of reasons, including not spiking the first baseman) so it's not so much a ""veer"" at the first base end as it is just making sure your last step catches that outer half of the bag in fair territory.",baseball

"It seems my post is being misunderstood. 

We are in agreement. At a certain level, it is a random chance, and a coin flip, ie “getting hot”. I’m not sure what I conveyed that makes anyone think you can build a hot team. 

The point I am making is that the recent trend with World Series winners is that the best constructed, smartest, dominant team has gone on to win the World Series. The 2019 Astros feel like the next progression in that trend, being the best team of the year (and best in a long time by many metrics). 

What the Nationals are reminding us is that, far more important than being “the best” is playing the best in October. Which is, as far as our understanding goes, pretty much random. Yes the Nationals are a great team bogged down by their April record. The Astros were the biggest favorite in a decade, nonetheless. The lesson I speak of is not in regards to team building or armchair GMing. Of course you can’t build a hot team. It’s about our expectations of who should win these series. Remember how everyone wanted to award the Astros the World Series after they got Greinke?

By the way, why do all these angry, venomous posts come from dudes without flairs?",baseball

"I disagree on both points. 
Why does he need to run ""outside"" the runners lane? I'm pretty sure he is allowed to run on the dirt, which he did.

It was a bad call. Maybe the umps were right by the letter of the law, but that doesn't make the law right.",baseball

"&gt; That was a bigger mistake than Acuña made, as far as the outcome of the game is concerned.

Except it wasn't? There isn't a double play to end the inning if Acuna is on third instead of second.

Fowler's most likely didn't even matter. If Markakis hadn't been lazy, Fowler would've stopped at second. And if he stopped at second, literally nothing changes since Goldschmidt was walked next to load the bases.

The only scenario in which the Markakis play had a bigger impact is if you're reallllllly stretching it. Like, you'd have to assume Fowler somehow decides to go first to third on that play even with a charging Markakis. The reason he tried to go to third is *because* Markakis wasn't charging it hard. He would've just stayed at second if Markakis was charging, and literally nothing would've changed in the overall outcome since Goldy drew a walk next.",baseball
"Yeah I've read that starters typically have a whole day routine to get ready to pitch and coming out of the pen is uncomfortable for many of them.

All except for Heath Hembree, who stopped and signed an autograph for literally every single person that asked, and it was at least 100 people. I love the guy now, even when his pitching frustrates me.",baseball
"I don’t know about that. 

How about the first? Greinke couldn’t throw a strike yet we only get one run. Was that Grenike good or Yankees bad?

He got injured in the middle of last year (after having a good start to the season). When he came back, they gave him bullpen time.

"This is going to sound like cognitive dissonance coming from a Cardinals fan watching his team get dismantled in historic fashion, but I'm seeing a lot of people say they would rather have just lost in the NLDS if they were a Cardinals fan, and I disagree. 

One team wins it all every year. Just one. And if that's the only worthwhile outcome, fandom isn't worth it. The memories of the exciting stuff to me make crappy endings worth it. I have never had more fun as a fan than I did watching the 04 Cards win in the NLCS in seven games, even though I then had to watch the best Cardinals team of my lifetime get humiliated in the world series immediately after. I have no good memories of that series, but it was worth it for game 7 of the NLCS. This is similar. That Atlanta series was fantastic and exciting and entertaining, and I'd rather have those memories and recall this NLCS bitterly than never have the feelings in the first place. If I were a Braves fan, I wouldn't trade the NLDS game 3 conclusion just to avoid the misery of game 5. 

So good luck Nats, and well-played! Cardinals, this was a terrible effort, but none of it takes away from the memorable drama of the NLDS. So thanks, and see you again next year!",baseball

There's also no guarantee Freeman hits a homer there since pitching 101 tells you that you don't pitch the same to a guy with power who represents the tying run compared to a bases empty situation where you have a run to give.

I totally made up 80% but it seems like most people agree it was likely an out or at the very least not enough to overturn even lots of Braves fans. Regardless, blaming the game on a very close call that is hard to decide on even after review when you team gave up 7 runs is really soft.",baseball

"Wrong. It is not faster. This is provable. 

If it were faster to run through point A than it is to dive to point A there would literally never be a single diving play in the outfield with the fielder moving perpendicular to the flight of the ball. They would instead run through to the same point and avoid the dive, but they don't do that. They don't do that because it is much faster to dive to a point on the ground in front of you than it is to run through it.

"The difference with Kershaw is the amount of innings pitched because he consistently plays for a top contender. So instead of comparing a starters ERA against a 40 inning career postseason sample, we have nearly a full season’s worth of data to compare his to. 

The way regression works is that small sample variance “regresses” to the mean extrapolated over large data sizes. So you would expect that over 150 innings, Kershaw would approach his 2.44 career ERA. Instead it’s two runs higher which yes( I would say makes him particularly bad. And the difference - 2 full runs on an ERA over that full a sample is HUGE. He had a 3.03 ERA in 178 IP this year... if his ERA became 5.03 next year over a similar sample people would be freaking out, and rightfully so. 

Greinke is another “choke” pitcher who comes to mind although a much smaller sample - 3.35 ERA in 2872 innings, and in 81 innings 4.44 ERA. That being said, 81 innings is still a really small sample so it’s tough to call him a “choke” the way Kershaw is. 

The last problem with this is the idea of stat stabilization. Basically there is a “cutoff point” that tells us when a certain stat becomes meaningful. So obviously you go 2/4 on opening day, the .500 average isn’t meaningful. Well when does it become meaningful? Over 50 plate appearances? 100? 200? 

https://library.fangraphs.com/principles/sample-size/

This is a great article talking about stabilization points for common stats. The problem with any postseason sample is that a) it’s too small and many statistics we’re looking at haven’t reached their “stabilization point” and therefore aren’t meaningful, and b) it’s a funneled data set, fueled by having only the best batters in baseball face you, so it lacks external validity and generalization to regular data sets. 

Although if we follow the logic of the MLB article, if pitching gets *better* in October and you get worse, relative to everyone else, you’re even worse than you were in the regular season because the new “league average standard” are the very best pitchers in the sport. But again, small sample size!",baseball

Trout was a better hitter

Trout plays a more difficult position

I don't think Betts would have put up 20 DRS at CF, I don't even know if Betts would've been better defensively in CF than Trout

Usually! Sometimes the batter hits a ball that would have been a sure hit with no runners on, but the defense gets lucky and has a play on another runner.

Second off, it is fucking ABSURD that the runner has to go back to first when he reached second base before the fucking throw even happened.  That part of the rule doesn't make an ounce of sense and never will.

The Nationals and the Astros have the best starting line ups in baseball IMO, though the Astros’s pitching staff has definitely had a better year, in part because Scherzer got injured and because Garret Cole is having the best season of his life. 

The key people to watch on the Astros are Garret Cole and Justin Verlander. Verlander is the best pitcher in the American League IMO and one of them is going to win the Cy Young Award this year. The two of them are #1 and #2 this year for...

Since you probably still won't believe me, here's [FanGraphs telling you instead:](https://library.fangraphs.com/pitching/xfip/)

&gt; In a very simple sense, FIP tells you how a pitcher has performed (value) independent of their defense while xFIP tells you about how well he **has** pitched (ability, talent) independent of their defense.

In another spot in the same article:

&gt; xFIP is a terrific way to get a sense of how well a pitcher’s been throwing the ball.

I emphasized the part that you need to see. Stats like FIP, xFIP, SIERA, and kwERA are all better at predicting future performance than stats like ERA and W-L but that doesn't make them predictive. They describe things in the past and are thus **descriptive** statistics.",baseball

Brewers only had used Suter and Pomeranz from the pen before then. Craig could've used the rest of his long bullpen (since the wild card is its own round, no need to put more than one starter on the roster) to get through the 8th and only asked for 3 outs from Hader instead of 6, which required him to save some strength for the 9th.

"This is kind of crazy. Historically speaking, home field advantage in baseball means the home team wins 55% of the time. For the sake of example, let's assume that the home team in the World Series got to be the home team because they are actually better than the other team - this isn't how home field usually worked historically, but lets assume so. So lets throw an extra 5% on there.

That means you'd expect the road team to win 40% of the time in games 1 and 2, 50% of the times in games 3, 4 and 5 (since we're assuming the road team is actually better than the home team in that series, their better quality cancels out the HFA for the home team), and then again in game 6 the road team is a 40% underdog.

Put that all together and the road team would be expected to win the first 6 games 0.8% of the time.

"&gt;Rule 5.09(a)(11) Comment: The lines marking the three-foot lane are a part of that lane and a batter-runner is required to have both feet within the three-foot lane or on the lines marking the lane. The batter-runner is permitted to exit the three-foot lane by means of a step, stride, reach or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base for the sole purpose of touching first base.

The batter is protected from interference if he is exiting the running lane on his final stride. He is not protected from said interference if he exits the lane before the final stride or never enters the lane at all. Given that he never has both feet inside the three-foot lane marked on the field, and had his left foot practically in the grass most of the way down, any ball that hits him can be judged as interference as per this rule.

I’m not saying I agree that the rule is good or doesn’t need changed, I’m just saying that this rule was correctly applied. It’s a pretty goofy ass rule given that the lane is foul and the bag is fair, but it is the rule.


Edit: I might have explained it better in [this comment.](https://reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/dp0wa0/_/f5s0p2s/?context=1) The idea is that per the rule the batter-runner can be judged to have interfered if he is outside of the three-foot lane. The comment to the rule only clarifies that the runner is allowed to leave that lane on the final stride for the purpose of reaching the bag. Since Turner was never fully in the lane, he cannot as such exit the lane at the final stride, and so the judgement call can exist.",baseball
"&gt; You're allowed to get to the bag as a runner

You're only allowed to get the bag if you're in your lane prior. If you're not in the lane prior, you have no right to the bag. That's the key piece the announcers (who aren't experts on the rules - they're good, but MLB rules are fucking complicated) forgot. 

If Turner had moved over a few steps prior I'd agree, but you forfeit your right to the bag without interference called on you if you don't stay in your lane.

Anyone who's watched post-season Kershaw knows he usually gets into trouble with walks after hitters grind out 7, 8, 9 pitch at bats.

Jomboy tweeted it out so it's out there for your viewing pleasure. It's an ego trip, not to mention the other poorly called balls and strikes this game.

Gomes isn't a wizard behind the plate at framing, but he's not bad at it either by any means. Certainly not going to lose you the game because of it.",baseball
"This is a historic moment.

"You are full of logical fallacies my dude, I said nothing of stepping off the bag. Trea ran to the base within the base line, his left foot hit the base on the edge, his right foot landed on the foul side, the throw was behind him, and the first basemen reached through Trea instead of around him to go behind him and lost his mitt. That's why the judgement call that can't be reviewed was actually called, because of the dropped mitt. If the rule is correct that Trea was at fault, the rule is dumb. They are not saying anything about him being in the lane, they are saying he interfered with the first basemen.",baseball

"I'm just not sure I can buy that. 

The pitching depth in the NL is just horrifically lacking.  There's always a fair shot that the pitching strings some good outings, they are major leaguers after all.   But none of the the remaining teams have stable bullpens and in a 7 game set against any of the AL teams left you're going to need it. Especially against the Stros or Yankees.  Both teams had notably better offense than anything in the NL, including the Dodgers. 

Nationals have the starting pitching, but can they throw 32 innings in 4 games, especially after this series and the wild card game+ the potential LCS? 

Cardinals offence is just... literally below league average. They were roughly as potent as the Indians who had noted offensive struggles. 

Unless the Rays make the series, the NL team is gonna be a massive underdog.",baseball
You people can circlejerk all you want. The Yankees will ALWAYS be in it. Sooner or later they will dominate again. That is what burns you. You may win again. But you will fade into obscurity. Have your last place finishes. The Yankees will always be the top franchise in baseball history. They will always have a winning culture. They will always have a greater history and counting than all your franchises put together. That is not me being a cocky Yankee fan. That is truth. That is FACT. I hope you all choke on your envy. It's fucking disgusting.,baseball
"The AJ Hinch decision to pull Greinke and not bring in Cole reminds of the AL Wildcard in 2016. Buck Showalter mysteriously decided not to put in Britton and the Jays went on to win on a walk off jack by Encarnacion in the 11th. Britton that year was the league's most dominant reliever.

I know, I know, they have a $ advantage, but these teams are owned by BILLIONAIRES and shouldn’t be able to cry poor without release their books. I’m almost certain any of the other 29 teams could afford more payroll to keep them competitive even if trying to rebuild. Honestly what needs to happen is that there needs to be some randomization of the draft picks such that the worst record doesn’t guarantee the first pick.",baseball
"Cannot disagree more. Greinke gave up 2 hits. 2... on 80 pitches. Hinch takes him out with a runner on first and puts in a guy that he said himself needs a break and just gave up a mammo bomb the night before. At least let greinke get a man into scoring position before pulling him. By pulling him there hinch is basically saying ""I don't trust you at all with this game and you have until the very first sign of any trouble before I take you out.""
Look at it this way... Would you say the same thing about taking Scherzer out after the 2nd inning? It would be 100% the right move since he was not completely healthy and clearly not his best. But the nats left him in there cause it was his game to win or lose.
I'm not saying greinke would have continued to dominate but you at least give the man a chance. He's earned that much. The absolute worst thing you can do is take him out when he's rolling and let the Nationals see you don't trust him at all and the guy that stymied them for 6+ innings is finally out. Time to score some runs.",baseball
"The Nationals are done for a very long time

Our window has closed. Sad that we wasted the talent that we had the last 7-8 years but that’s how it is.

This season so far is unraveling that Rizzo is an overrated hack and Martinez is a bottom tier manager, both of which I’ve been saying for years.

Anthony Rendon will be gone next year and this team will officially turn in to crap, and the only thing we can hope is if Soto magically returns to rookie form.",baseball
It makes sense in tennis not to allow coaching during a match. It's already unequal  enough that established players are able to afford better trainers and coaches. Imagine how unequal it would be for an established player to get coaching on all of the ways they are succeeding in the match and the ways they and their opponent are failing while their opponent might not even be able to afford to hire a coach to help them out in this way during a match. It's not at all like a team sport where the coach is hired by the team instead of out of the pocket of the players themselves.,baseball
"Sure, fair point, but that's literally game 7 of the WS. This is game 4 of the DS with a 2-1 lead.

The Indians rode kluber and Miller as hard as they could in 2016 and they both ran out of gas near the end. 

The dodgers had Kershaw pitch 5 games in a 2 week span in 2016 and he blew up in NLCS game 6.",baseball
"Most umps get all hard-assed and refuse to give an inch after the manager comes out like that. Hinch seemed pretty chill, asked if he could ask the other umps, and it seemed like he realized it was a clear swing-and-miss. Next pitch wasn't awful despite being outside, and he made it right.",baseball
"Yeah, like I wouldn't mind if he just struck out, oh well, it is what it is. But the fact that he gets struck out on a clearly wrong make up call just feels bad even if it's the ""right"" thing to do, just a shitty situation for everyone. Wtf is Sanchez supposed to do, swing at that?",baseball
"I agree that the game was awesome, but it's 1am on the east coast and a massive chunk of people who love these teams have to wake up for work in like 4 or 5 hours. Why start the game at 8pm? You're going to lose viewers to football no matter what.",baseball
"It's right by the letter of the rule but against the spirit of the rule. Yes, the runner should have been further right in the lane, yes he interfered with the catch, but he only interfered because of poor defensive play and likely would have interfered even if he had stayed in the runners lane in foul territory.

It was a judgement call by the ump and it was really poor judgement to call that out in a world series game. He's lucky the Nats won anyways.",baseball
"&gt; Leaving him in would be playing to win the game, saving him was playing to win the series.

That much said, I like Kershaw. He got out a huge jam the inning before. Things sometimes just don't work out. But he didn't lose the game, either.  The Dodgers had one hit over the final four innings against what was supposed to be the Nats' weak link - its bullpen.",baseball

I went home for a wedding in Baltimore a week after we were talking about this. The distance from DC-Balt is very similar from my current town to Omaha.

"He doesn't owe the Yankees a thing. All they did was fail to draft an 18 year old boy and then fail to trade for him later when they had the chance.

I'd love it if Cole came to New York. It's the type of splashy free agent signing the team doesn't really do anymore (Stanton was somebody else's bad contract that we assumed responsibility for), but unlike Stanton, Cole would actually be filling a place of need on the team.

If the Yankees want him, they'll have to try harder. He has no sentimentality towards the team, nor should he. It's a business so he should go for the money if that's what he cares about, and also he should do what makes him happy regarding where to live.",baseball
"Cole got lucky today and/or the Yankees just did a really good job of hitting against him. Not only did he strike out way fewer batters than usual (23% is hardly even above league for starting pitchers), and walk way more than usual (a horrific 17%), but even when the Yankees put the ball in play, they hit it really hard. A 91.6 MPH average exit velocity against would have ranked as the highest exit velocity for any starting pitcher in the game this year (min. 200 BIP). He had a terrible pitching line, and his performance tonight definitely should not be used as evidence that Jim Crane should ""pay the man.""

"To give them more credit than they deserve: in three of Greinke's ten starts with the Stros he gave up 4+ runs, and in fact his worst start was against TB.

"He didn't manage the team. The failure to run out routine flys was a problem repeatedly all year. He made several late game calls that were baffling except on a spreadsheet somewhere (ph Gosselin vs Bruce comes immediately to mind), pulling pitchers that were cruising to play matchups (again, spreadsheets) which might have been fine if we had a full bullpen of reliable arms. Constantly tinkering with the lineup- I think we had 4 total games where the lineup card was the same. He couldnt even relay to Hernandez that the one time he did bench a player was because they didnt it out and Hernandez thought he was having an off day. The last straw for philly was him name dropping dallas green as an excuse as to why the team was so bad.",baseball
"The thing last year was not about stealing signs. 

Both CLE and BOS (and a few other teams) were accused by multiple teams throughout the year of using their in-dugout screens to view camera angles you are not supposed to have. Specifically direct-look views of the catcher and forward facing looks directly at the bullpen arms warming. 

So in response to those warnings we set up a dude to watch the screens in their dug out ready to record if they started showing angles you are not allowed to have. CLE complained because they needed an excuse for getting fucking destroyed, the MLB investigated including looking at everything recorded / photographed by the guy in question and we were completely cleared. There was no evidence of him trying to film or photograph the team making signs from the dug out, there was no communication between the man and our team or anyone else during the game itself, etc etc. 

TLDR 'We were not cheating; we were making sure THEY were not cheating' might be a meme but its actually what happened here and the MLB confirmed it. The reason they made the new rule about electronic surveillance of dugouts was to avoid an idiotic PR shit show like this in the future but we were not doing anything wrong unlike those cheating cunt Red Socks using apple watches in '17",baseball

I don't see why people would hate the Astros. Most of their team is home grown they built this team from the ground up pretty much.

Would you be thinking to yourself right now, “damn, turner should have been called out there.” ? I bet you the answer is no. I bet you would have said, “damn, what a bad throw by the pitcher there. He should have just held it and given him the base.”

Your reaction to a call if it hadn’t been made is a good way to determine if a rule is dumb.

Think about the pine tar game. If Brett hit that homer and nobody said anything, there wouldn’t  be a guy out there saying, “hey they should have measured how much pine tar Brett had on his bat. That home run shouldn’t have counted.”",baseball

Scherzer is 4 years older and 7.7 rWAR behind. CC is retiring 8 years older with 5 fewer WAR.

"No, the problem with the running lane rule is that the base is in fair territory, so a runner has to be at least partially in fair territory to touch the base, but the lane is painted entirely in foul territory. If everyone followed the rule to the letter, players would be spraining knees and ankles on first base constantly because they'd have to step on the corner of the bag. A left handed batter can run a straight line through the bag and not have an issue, but a right handed batter's straight line is always partially in fair territory provided they're not standing in the back corner of the box.

"I know that no group of people is homogenous, and I’m sure you’re a great person, but in my experience, Yankees fans are sore winners and sore losers. They are constant trolls throwing shit at players and saying ridiculous shit online and [wearing shirts](https://twitter.com/thenyybabe2/status/1184942155892187137?s=21) that say shit like “I plowed Grienke’s wife” and then taunt that same player during the game about his mental health. So yeah, fuck Yankees fans in general",baseball
"Something I think people arent considering is how much more aggressive batters are in the post season.

I've seen way more guys swinging at first pitches throughout this post season than through the regular season by what feels like a lot. I dont have the stats to support it.

These guys arent playing it like they do through the grind of the regular season. They arent taking a ton of pitches to try and drive guys out of the game, they are seeing something that looks like they can hit it and swinging.

For a guy like Kershaw who lives and dies by getting ahead in counts and controlling the plate it can hurt him. Last night was a great example of it. That stat about him never giving up Homer's on back to back pitches except these two times in the playoffs makes a lot of sense within this context.

Of course again I don't have statistics to back this up it's just what it feels like as I'm watching.",baseball
"I haven't watched any sort of highlights either, and I refuse to watch any of the NFL Top 100 Games series on youtube since I know it'll be in there somewhere. The game ending touchdown in overtime was on the NFL Top 100 Plays at like 34 or something, and I couldn't close the video fast enough.",baseball
It also looks like the coach was saying something about his eyes before he comes set. It’s hard to tell if this is correct from this video alone but it seems like he was glancing down as he came set for the curveball. Would be interesting to check this out with the game footage.,baseball
"Oh wait, no, I wasn’t meaning to say the Indians wouldn’t have been a gimme round like the Twins are. All I meant was mostly a reply to everyone saying the Indians wouldn’t have stood a chance that, no, they would have at least had a chance. Same as the Twins did and still do. And, right, no doubt the regular season record mostly goes out the window once the playoffs start, but I do feel it’s foolish to discount it completely like the not a chance crowd is doing.

Anyway, again, the point is moot because it isn’t gonna happen as the Indians couldn’t cut it this year. The Twins 100% were the deserving team, and I still do think they have a chance with that killer lineup and always did - did not mean to imply otherwise.",baseball
"Play Adams or Zimmerman? You mean like we've been doing all year when Zim hasn't been injured? Crazy!

Edit: Okay, I'll own this one. Most Nationals fans (me included) probably wanted Kendrick's bat in the lineup. And he did play 1st a lot this season and wasn't as bad as he's been so far. He helped get us here.",baseball
"I mean, I see where you are coming from, but at the same time, after missing Lemieux, you won it all three times in four finals appearances over the next twenty years.  The Flyers have had one finals appearance in the twelve years since Kane was drafted.  We lost in overtime, on a goal scored by, you guessed it, Patrick Kane.",baseball
"Listening to Torre's explanation after the game (no clue how I can post a link to this video, but it's on [mlb.com](https://mlb.com)), Holbrook called Turner out for running outside the lane because in doing so he interfered with Gurriel taking the throw at first base. Torre read rule 5.09 (a)(11) out loud during the press conference.",baseball
"Idk but when I was a young boy, my father took me into the city to see a marching band. 

He said, “son— there’s some cheap fucking people in this world who will give you silver instead of gold on the internet, even though it doesn’t exist yet, it will be called Reddit. You’ll deserve gold, but they’ll give it to the bots. Don’t let it define your worth.”

I hope my father’s words can help you, as well.",baseball
"Astros PR understands they live in a society where accusations are a certainty. Osuna and the Astros flat out denying it when no amount of evidence could determine 100% innocence is going to be seen as an attack on women by the media.

Yes the accuser was there. So it's the accuser's word vs the accused. There is no other evidence beyond that. No one has heard from the child. I'm pretty sure the child was an infant so the child isn't a reliable witness.",baseball
"Kind of funny because I was getting jealous of Acuna getting all the attention with winning ROY last year and him being in MVP discussion this year and Soto is just quietly playing out of his mind in the background. Im glad hes getting all the attention now in the WS. Just to be clear, I dont hate Acuna or anything. In fact, I love him too but I love my son more.",baseball
"I thought he was done for good in 2018.  I figured there was only so many injuries an arm can go through before you give up. 

Daniel Hudson is a world fucking champion in 2019.

I’m proud, but I still think he should retire before his elbow completely falls apart.",baseball
"Absolutely agree... I feel that DJ should be the MVP because he played so many positions for the yankees this year and he played them all so freaking well when they needed him most.

MVP shouldn't only be offensive stalwart numbers but all around ability for the Valuable aspect of MVP",baseball
"And on a different note, no-WW-II Ted Williams would have had one hell of an insane stretch. Dude had 3 straight 11+ WAR seasons, with one coming after the war and two before it. So he may well have had 6 straight 11 WAR seasons, or at least a few more 11 WAR seasons with the 3 years in his prime he missed.",baseball
"Better. I'm actually the one who initiated the hold. I had downed a *lot* of whiskey because at that point my thought was, ""if I die, that's okay"". Eventually I got second thoughts and called the police, who honestly could not have been more professional and courteous. They even pulled over to let me vomit in some random yard. 

I did the hold for three days, talked to some people in the facility (other patients and therapists) and was given some perspective. I felt guilty when I was finally allowed my phone back, but honestly it felt good to know that there were people out there who were that worried about me. 

I won't lie, it's still a daily struggle. I'm not sure depression is something you can ever really be cured from. I have to remind myself all the time that there's people out there who care about me, and that alone makes life worth living. 

I don't have suicidal ideation really anymore,  so that's definitely a step in the right direction.",baseball
The playoffs and the season are already long enough for the most part. If a team wants to avoid a wild card game then they have to win their division. It's the incentive to win as many games as possible. And the teams that won their divisions shouldn't be iced because they have to wait for the guys who squeaked in to do a series.,baseball
"&gt; pro athletes are avatars for their communities at large and their wrongdoings should be scrutinized as such

Sorry, but this is ridiculous. Everybody is equal under the law. We can’t treat some people harder just because they’re famous. That’s frankly bullshit and unfair to anybody who happens to be famous. Also... to what level of fame does this increased scrutiny start? Osuna is a star closer, but what about a middle reliever? Or a backup outfielder? A trainer? Or what about a really famous architect with his name on lots of buildings? 

Politicians are different because they need public trust to do their job. This comparison makes no sense.",baseball
"The base is in fair territory, if you can be called out for interference during your last stride to the base then there really isn’t anything else you can do as a runner.

I’d be ok if MLB picked up the softball style bases where they extend into foul territory but only for the batter going to first. Otherwise you have to use the standard base location.",baseball
If the Yankees lose this game it will be the first time since their first AL pendent in 1921 that they will go a full decade without a pendent. It will also be the first time since the 1980s that they will go a full decade without winning a World Series.,baseball
"It depends on the thing, but social change often starts with just one person. We should listen when people say “this is demeaning to me” and not be so quick to rattle off a million reasons why it isn’t. We aren’t listening on this topic. 

In this situation it’s more than one person who is offended, making it an easier moral choice to listen to them.",baseball
"No. On multiple fronts.

At catcher, Sánchez, albeit not a complete a total liability behind the plate, is bad enough to make a mockery of it. He is a horrible framer. This year, of the 32 guys who caught 600 innings behind the plate, Sánchez was 25th in framing according to both Baseball Savant and Fangraphs. He also led the league in errors committed by a catcher.

At the plate, he wasn't even the best offensive catcher this year. Yasmani Grandal not only played more than Sánchez but also did laps around his numbers, having a .380 OBP to Sánchez' .316, scoring 17 more runs than Sánchez driving in as many runs as him despite six less homers in a more pitcher friendly ballpark than Yankee Stadium. And his OPS was higher than Sánchez'. The worst part of that is Grandal wasn't even the best hitting catcher either. That was Mitch Garver, who socked a .995 OPS and 31 homers in a little over 300 ABs.  

And as far as ever is concerned, Mike Piazza, Mickey Cochrane and Johnny Bench are all in Cooperstown and they would all like to have a word with you. Gary Sánchez is not even the greatest hitting Yankee catcher ever. Did you forget Yogi Berra and Bill Dickey exist?!",baseball
"None of what you are saying applies to what I’ve said. I never defended the Astros and their fuckup.

I never once said the Astros were in the right for keeping the man around who said those nasty things. Not once. I never once said “these women deserve to be oppressed!” or whatever the fuck your petty little mind thinks I’ve said.

I just said the guy is a bad journalist (he is) and he wanted to come put his 2 cents in on the topic while the iron was hot. That makes him a white knight whether you like the wording or not. Sorry it put your panties in a wad.

Nice sarcastic response though champ! GFY",baseball
"That’s 99 with a good 9 fucking inches of arm side run to a RHH, legitimately unhittable and because you read it as a normal FB and has such late break, there’s virtually no shot you can ever even foul it off in that location. I’d love to see his grip and how he throws that shit",baseball
"He's a good manager, but he may not be good enough to get them over the hump. While some teams might kill for WS visits, managing the Dodgers he's expected to win. Unfortunately you can point to a lot of managerial mistakes that have cost them series (though you could say the same for guys like Francona or Maddon).",baseball
"I'm never upset if Osuna fucks things up. Would rather have Will Harris pitching anyway. Honestly was rooting for Osuna to blow up during the regular season since we were so far up

Edit: To clarify still cheer for him to close out the games in the playoffs, but not as upset if he blows the save as I would be if it were Will Harris or Ryan Pressly",baseball
"Except, he's not running in that designated area (from 5.09(a)(11)).  Just watch where his feet step before he makes contact with the glove.

I didn't see the play live, but watching the replay makes me wonder if the announcers simply didn't explain the rule properly to the audience with how everyone reacted.",baseball
"I just think the end result is what matters because ultimately there are alot of different ways to get there, there's no ""correct one."" You can make a bunch of decisions with the right idea idea behind it, but if they all fail you're gonna get fired. The thing this more often than not those decisions do work out, but there are instances where they don't, and in those instances they're wrong. 

Draft picks I agree with, how the picks are used has nothing to do with how you value the trade. But in baseball we don't have that, prospects aren't draft picks.",baseball
"Yep between the two mega deals signed last year, I think machado's will age much worse despite the derision that Bryce harper gets.  Manny is simply an average player outside Camden yards, and I definitely wouldn't want him influencing my team's young players the next 10 years with his attitude.  But the Padres wanted a big splash, big name and made their bed",baseball
"Best part is making the obvious joke they’ll come at you with before they can say it. Like now that I see the humor in being one of the best teams of all time, to just shitting the entire dugout, I just open with that. 

And this Phillies fan that just keeps showing up. I think I hate him more than anyone

Don’t walk *directly* into this, cmon. Our pitching... the city as a whole...",baseball
"I think a lot has to do with the fact that there are no other teams anywhere near. For instance, living in Columbus, both Ohio teams, both Chicago teams, the Pirates and the Tigers are all easy to get to for me. 

I wonder if the Rockies’ excellent social media team plays a part as well. I follow all the teams and their accounts made me want to learn more.",baseball
"The pitching changes came from two things: First, some pseudo-science about 100 pitches being a. magic number that drastically increases the risk of injury, and second because analytics has determined that pitchers BAA goes way up the third and fourth times through the order.

Put some expansions in there and there aren't enough pitchers to put 3 guys able to go 7-8 innings in a playoff game on every team. 

Teams are simply managing to the odds, and the odds say don't let anyone except the best of the best get a third time to face the order. 

I'd sooner back a change to a 6 or 7 inning game than restricting how many players a team can use. But if they did that, teams would make starters go 3-4 IP for the same phenomenon about BAA the second time through the order.",baseball
"He's referencing the 2016 ALWC. Britton had just had arguably the best season for a reliever in Baseball history, but the Orioles never used him in the WC game because there wasn't a save situation. They ended up getting walked off in extras after using a starter instead of Britton.",baseball
"I was thinking that a few minutes after the Dodgers lost. I feel like I'm stuck in a broken loop where nothing good ever happens! But I am not leaving, I'm still waiting because I know I will miss out on a world series win if we actually get one. I have been a Dodgers fan since I was 6 and I'm 13 now. That is 7 years of staying loyal to the fan base. 7 years of experiencing great moments! And yes! You will regret throwing out your collection of all that stuff! Don't do this to yourself!",baseball
"Lol yes my dude I am definitely enjoying dodger blue lose every single year 

I’ll take a few down years after THREE rings. It’ll be sad when you guys don’t get a ring after all these division titles and you’re worse off then the g men in 3 years. Oh I almost forgot, thanks for Farhan ;)",baseball
"I'm not trying to be a dick, but I'm genuinely curious why you think that's a good or likable quality in a player. It reminds me of that quote from The Replacements, ""*Winners always want the ball when the game is on the line*"".

If Zack was confident that he was their best chance at winning the game, he should've told Hinch not to pull him. The fact that he allowed Hinch to pull him without putting up a fight makes it seem like he didn't want the game resting on his shoulders.",baseball
You’re right. It’s extremely challenging to make everything flow properly to the arm. It’s a layering process on paper until you find the right layout then you go for it. The upper arm is the only fresh piece in this picture and it was a 10 1/2 hr session. Hope I answered your questions!,baseball

"It blows me away how manageable this whole situation was from the get-go and how badly they fucked it all up. Even now, having done the right thing and fired the guy, all they have to do is say they're sorry and that they'll have internal meetings about how to create a more sensitive culture, etc etc, yet they still can't stop fucking up.",baseball
"Noting that the Astros are adding this Urquidy kid to the rotation next year along with Lance McCullers Jr. We've also got a kid in the minors named Whitley who's starting to throw the ball well, too.

Irrespective of our willingness to chase Cole with high-dollars and long-duration in the offseason, the Astros will show back up in 2020 with a stacked rotation.",baseball
"I didn't say it is ridiculous to think hes going to the Hall of Fame I said I expect him to be there, just not if it all stopped last night.

Edit: to the second point that is an interesting question.  

I would put Betts ahead of him 2 years younger and a slightly better career to date.  

His direct competition is probably Yellich, Rendon, Machado who he is almost definitely better than all three though over the next few years that could change depending on how things go.

After that you have Bellinger and Bregman who are on a higher trajectory but who knows if one of them will prove to be more Harper than Trout.",baseball
"Come on... there are bad stats; this ain't one of them. Late go-ahead home run in the WS isn't some arbitrarily useless designation; it's just lengthy. How about this:

KURT SUZUKI OLDEST PLAYER WITH HOME RUN THAT LITERALLY EVERY KID GROWING UP PLAYING BASEBALL DREAMS ABOUT SINCE 1949

Well, still lengthy I guess...",baseball
"We haven't had much to celebrate as far as our sports teams go in a very long time. Up until last year, it was nothing but should've beens and almosts for over 25 years.

That both the Caps, Mystics and Nats got to their respective sports championship series one after the other is incredible. Everyone I know was hyped about the Caps, and the Nats run is just as huge.

It also helps that it really is a community as far as the major (non-NFL - we don't talk about them) teams go. The level of support for the Caps from the other teams was huge, and now the same is happening for the Nats.

There honest to god isn't a sports community that I'd rather be a part of at this point. People can scream until they're blue in the face that we're not a hockey/baseball/whatever town, but we love our teams and our teams love our other teams, and us. After the Caps won, Ovi and the guys wandered around with the Cup just EXISTING alongside normal Washingtonians, like some sort of roving block party. Iirc there's video of them just walking down a random street in broad daylight with the Stanley Cup, more than a little wasted, as people in cars cheered at them.

Every city thinks that their teams are special, but I think that DC sports culture has really turned into something wonderful the past few years.",baseball
"The shirt I wore last night I have worn four other times:

2017 World Series Game 7

2019 ALDS Game 5

2019 ALCS Game 2 (I put it on when we were down 2-1 and we came back to win)

2019 ALCS Game 6

And now 2019 World Series Game 3.

However I am not wearing it tonight. It needs to recharge.",baseball
"Nah man just cmon if every call stayed the same except the ones that didn't help the Nationals, they'd have only been behind by 4 runs and had an at bat with two outs and the bases loaded and obviously that's going to be a home run with the #8 hitter up. And then who knows what could have happened differently.",baseball
"Holy moly this post is absolute nonsense. You can't construct a team to get hot at the right time, you construct a team that is as good as possible at winning baseball games and then hold on for dear life as you watch them play a sport that is VERY close to flipping coins when two good teams play each other. 

What is there to be learned from the Giants? ""Build a team that averages 87 wins a year and goes on 3 hot streaks over  the course of 9 series that is completely unrepeatable and generally regarded as one of the most bizarre and unlikely things that's ever happened in the sport"". Jesus the playoffs really mess with people's head but the absolute stupidity that flows from over-scrutiny of a tiny sample in a game with tiny edges is insane. And disappointing to see this crap upvoted in a serious discussion thread.",baseball
"All excellent ideas. He has actually sat down with his team, According to an interview Yelich gave on the situation, and one of the things he addressed was not just teammates that may be bothered by it, but specifically asking about people close to them, who don’t know Josh the way his teammates do. That was at least one point he not only brought up, but took very seriously; he didn’t want a sugar-coated version of Eric Thames’ aunt’s feelings. He wanted to hear pure reactions, sentiments that helped him even better understand why he was wrong. Understandably, Yelich didn’t feel he was in a position to air dialogue between Josh &amp; his teammate’s families, but as far as Christian Yelich has let us know, Josh has at least gone beyond the bare minimum",baseball
"I mean he ran into the glove before he touched the base. I don’t know how that’s not interference. 

No, anytime someone is running to first base, is outside the lines, and interferes with the throw they should be out. You’re a joke if you don’t think knocking the glove off is interference.",baseball
"More likely the Astros realized their tells weren’t working at some point and had to play it straight up

Turns out Strasburg is a fucking savage so having to guess what pitch he is throwing makes it really hard to touch him when he is pitching well

I highly doubt the Astros were just befuddled and continued to fall for the same deke tells over and over",baseball
NBA and NHL playoffs take way too long. It’s kind of pointless when half or more of the league makes the playoffs. I think the MLB and NFL do it right. You have to actually compete to make the playoffs and even better in the MLB you have to win your division if you want to guarantee yourself more than 1 game,baseball
"xBA isn't totally meaningful in cases like this anyway since it doesn't take direction into account, only exit velo and launch angle. So it'd be the same if it were hit directly at him.

It's usually more of a tell of how screwed over the batting team got by the BABIP gods.",baseball
"You don't even have to stick to the ordinary effort argument. The rule is supposed to be invoked immediately. Given the speed of plays developing in baseball, i'll even agree that you could call it at the peak of the fly ball.

It was called with the ball literally 10 feet off the ground once it was apparent that no one was going to catch it.",baseball
Lol take the L on what? Because people downvoted me I now take the L? Reddit just hive mind downvotes. My point is true and well known by others before me and sports fans need to get rid of that thought in their head. You guys are arguing for a point that was never made by me and one that I head earlier said I agree with. There’s no L for me to take. There’s no W for you guys to take.,baseball
"Not a Yankees fan.  But if I were a Yankees fan, I would remind you that the 'decade' is technically 2011 to 2020, since there was no year 0 (i.e., the first decade was 1-10, not 1-9). Just like the third millennium started in 2001, not 2000. Not sure if this means they've already broken the streak.

Edit: sorry, didn't realize this was such a sensitive topic.",baseball
"I’m a born and bred Mets fan so I really fucking hate the Yankees but good on the organization for throwing this guy out. 

Don’t get me wrong, fuck the Yankees and all but that’s a really great move by the team and ballpark crew to get this guy out.",baseball
"ok I wonder...this is a question for lifelong fans of historically very winning teams like the Yankees...are you high all the time?

2015 and 2016 was such a time of excitement for me. I was watching tons of games religiously and feeling giddy all the time, even thinking about baseball at work and so on, and about he Blue Jays' playoff run.  

So do you feel giddy and excited all the time, or does the feeling wear off and you need something more to get that feeling?",baseball
"Yep. I *hated* it in the moment, but after chatting with a buddy who I certainly trust to know the rules more than anyone else I know, it was called correctly, and just is a shitty rule that rarely matters, but no one likes when it does.

As he explained it, if Trea had run in the lane, and *then* came in to touch the bag and the interference happened in the exact same spot the exact same way, he'd probably be safe. But because he was outside the lane, even though the interference happened in a place where it *might* have been allowable, he was thus out.

You raise a pretty obvious handicap that this creates, and it also is a fucking mess of a rule since it means circumstantial penalizing for something that might be OK, but is determined based on something that happened earlier and *didn't* impact things directly. I get the theory behind the rule, but it is clear that no matter how it is enforced, you're asking for a big mess.

For me, the solution is obvious though. They need to bring in the Little League Style Double-bag with the Orange half that goes on the outside to run through to give them both a little more space.",baseball
"It's Game 7. Bottom of the 9th, 2-1 Nationals, one on, two out. Bregman steps to the plate with Doolittle pitching. Here comes the pitch... 

*Smack*

""Deep, deep down the left field line, it is.... fair! It's a two-run home run, Bregman! The Astros win the World Series! And he's doing the bat carry celebration again -- let the party in Houston commence!""

*Crowd cheering*

""But wait a second, here comes Barksdale, and he's signaling **out** - what, why, how? The crowd doesn't realize it yet, but Bregman and Hinch both seem to know something is wrong. Here comes Hinch out of the dugout screaming! Meanwhile, the Nats are running to the mound for the dogpile! The Nationals look like... yes, Bregman is definitely being called out, the Nats are World Champions!""

*Hinch throws punches at Barksdale, melee ensues*

""We're getting word that the official call is batter interference on Bregman for carrying the bat down the line. And it's a judgement call by Barksdale, so no review. It's over, Astros lose on a technicality that will live on for ages. Oh the humanity!"" 

*Bonfires ignite in the Minute Maid Park right field bleachers and fans rip out seats and throw them on to the field. Amidst the chaos, Joe Torre slowly rises from his first-row seat behind home plate and walks over to Davey Martinez, who is munching on fistfuls of heart medication from the top step while his team celebrates on the field.*

""We good now, Davey?""

""Yeah Joe, thanks. We good.""",baseball
"He also made one of the stupidest decisions I have ever seen by a manager at the end of that 19-inning game against the D-backs. Tie game, Cards pitching to D-backs in the bottom of the 19th. Runners on first and second with 2 outs. Brebbia (right-handed) pitching. Christian Walker (right-handed) hitting. Ildemaro Vargas (switch hitter) on deck. Okay, so:

1. Brebbia is not an effective reliever against left-handed batters. He has a career 5.24 xFIP against lefties and 3.94 against righties. Probably in part because he is a fastball-slider guy.
2. With the game tied in the bottom of the 19th, one run is the same as three because you lose either way. With a runner in scoring position, you just need to avoid a hit of any kind.
3. Walker is a decent hitter, and better than Vargas most likely. But he doesn't hit for average. He's hitting around .260 at the time and that's while exceeding expectations. Probably closer to .250 true talent.
4. Vargas doesn't hit for power, but he *does* hit for average. Really low strikeout rate, presumably at least a .270+ hitter.

With that in mind...Schildt walks Walker to face Vargas. So in the bottom of the 19th in a tie game, with runners on first and second and 2 outs, he elects to load the bases for a hitter who very clearly has a *much* higher chance of getting a hit. An important game, too, as the Cards were obviously in a close race for the playoffs. After seeing this and how he leaves starters in for too long despite having a decent bullpen, I have no confidence in him as a manager. Also he looks funny.",baseball
"Altuve won MVP only because Trout was injured. Winning a WS is meaningless to determining the better player, unless you also wish to argue that Jake Marisnick is better than Trout on that basis. MVP of a playoff series is a small sample size. He had a good few games. Lots of people play well for a few games: Like the Seattle Mariners at the start of the season. Gold glove is meaningless. Trout won a Fielding Bible award. Who cares? Centerfield is easier than 2B? Lol. Yeah, no. Not even a little bit. 

Amazingly, you didn’t use a single stat. You used achievements, most of which are subjective. This is just really poor reasoning (or lack thereof) across the board. 

Seriously, how do any of those things *prove* Altuve is better than Trout? Simply listing them means nothing. Most of those things are voted on. 
They’re based on the perception of a limited number of people on a player’s accomplishments over a finite period of time. Winning a World Series championship is a team accomplishment. Switch Trout and Altuve, and the Astros and Angels are both still in the same place, roughly speaking. 

This is just total nonsense and completely devoid of any legitimate reasoning.",baseball
"I know a lot of Cubs fans aren't happy with this pick, but that's from our outside perspective of what he'll be like as a manager who's close to some of the team. Trusting that the front office knows the dynamic better than we do and trust that he's the man for the job",baseball

"I'm not saying it wasn't pivotal *at all*, just not game deciding like it's being made out to be in some places. I think it seems bigger than it actually is because the Nats were doing nothing for the 6 innings before that (aside from 2 hits) . It was a bad call for sure though.",baseball
"Consistency is key. He had been calling that “ball” a strike all game and all of a sudden on what would’ve been a strike 3 he calls ball. I’m with you that it should’ve been a ball the entire game, but the way baseball has been played for decades, once an ump dictates his strikzone, he HAS to be consistent with it. These umps have no been consistent enough.",baseball
"He is saying makeup calls are the correct thing to do. Aaron Judge is the most incorrectly called batter as per statcast in favor of the pitcher (mostly on low balls called strikes), while Altuve is the most incorrectly called batter in favor of the batter (mostly on low strikes called balls). 

He is saying that we should have make up calls. I was exaggerating, but by his logic, Judge should get totally hooked up, while Altuve should get unfairly penalized.

If you don't know here's what they're most likely wearing:

* Compression Pants
* Cup
* Leg Guards
* Plate Shoes
* Chest Protector 
* Ball Bag (MLB Umpires have 2)
* Mask

"I think both teams have been in a bit of a slump. Astros couldn't get anything right in game 1 and the Yankees looked unbeatable, but games 2 &amp; 3 were all about our star pitching. Game 4 was kind of a reverse game 1 in that the Astros hitting got hot and the Yankees committed some major errors. 

I think it's dumb to say that one team choked it away vs the other team winning it. It's also just insulting to the team that won. These are the best 2 teams in the AL, probably the best 2 in baseball. Neither are guaranteed a trip to the world series, so no one can say it was ever theirs to lose.",baseball

Early 2010s Miggy was about the most fearsome hitter you could imagine.",baseball
"Well, depending on the delivery of the message you run the risk of alienating a large group of young individuals that support the Hong Kong movement.

The NBA retracted their initial statement immediately in support of the ability to give all of their players, GMs and owners the ability to speak openly and freely. 

Whether we like it or not majority of baseball fans are 35 and older and baseball has trouble reaching out to the younger crowd. I would think it would just be better to run a campaign that focuses on that rather than anything NBA related. It's really a question of what would differentiate it from being just another AD campaign saying ""we love baseball watch baseball"" vs an effective means to grab a younger audience through current social issues?

"I think the following play a crucial role in why the game is 9 innings long: 

* It's easier to get a hitter out than it is for a hitter to get on base.  Pitchers have an advantage in every face off.  If games were shortened to 6 or 7 innings, you might have a pitcher dominate without breaking a sweat. 9 innings ensures you either need a sterling performance from a starter or you need your bullpen to come in. In short the pitching staff needs to be tested.  This is why things like shut outs and complete games are rare and coveted.  

*  Baseball is a game of averages.  Any statistician will tell you that data is more reliable with a larger sample size.  If games were 6 or 7 innings, most guys would only be guaranteed two at bats.  In a nine inning game every hitter is guaranteed 3 at bats, allowing for a larger sample size and a better idea of how that hitter is doing against the other team's pitching that day.",baseball

"Nice straw mans argument. You fail to understand how an at bat works, Robles isn't swinging at a pitch 2 feet outside if it's 1-0 because he would be tunneling in on a fastball or pitch down the middle. The 0-1 counts makes it so he can't tunnel and Cole isn't throwing that pitch in the first place if it's 1-0. Now it's a 0-2 count instead of a favorable 1-0 count where he can tunnel in.

"It being in the title =/= good storytelling. What the hell kind of an explanation is that?

“Game of Thrones” was in the title and Bran won “The Game of Thrones,” yet that was just about the worst writing of all time. “But it was in the title!” is apparently the explanation and justification for that.

Obi-Wan literally said only those highly trained in the force are able to do mind tricks. Defend it all you want, but that’s utter bullshit. She’d need training, not “I’m a Mary Sue so I can do anything!”

And I said “how does she know more about the Falcon than Han?” It’s not like he owned the damn thing for 30 years.

And I’m angry when corporations care more about money than storytelling, not because I want to be mad/upset. I’ll enjoy Rise if it’s a good movie. If it’s a bad movie, then I’ll complain again.",baseball
"If Strasburg left and went to Astros (hypothetically), do you think the Astros will unlock him the way they unlocked Cole, and take him to another level?

"OK, first off: an Astro, swimming in the ocean? Astros don't like water. If you placed it near a river or some sort of fresh water source, that make sense. But you find yourself in the ocean, 20 foot wave, I'm assuming off the coast of South Africa, coming up against a full grown 800 pound Flappy Boi with his 20 or 30 friends? You lose that battle, you lose that battle 9 times out of 10. And guess what, you've wandered into our school of flappy bois and we now have a taste of Astro. We've talked to ourselves. We've communicated and said 'You know what, Astro tastes good, let's go get some more Astro'. We've developed a system to establish a beach-head and aggressively hunt the Astros and their family and we will corner their pride, their children, their offspring. We will construct a series of breathing apparatus with kelp. We will be able to trap certain amounts of oxygen. It's not gonna be days at a time. An hour? Hour forty-five? No problem. That will give us enough time to figure out where you live, go back to the sea, get some more oxygen, and stalk you. Astros just lost at your own game. Astros are outgunned and out-manned.",baseball
"Key word: Disputed.  The author failed to take into account that teams have time after a call to quickly review replay and decide to challenge a call or not.  Teams SHOULD be winning challenges because they should be largely challenging calls they already know can be reversed.  The bigger question to me is, with teams able to review replay prior to a challenge in most cases, why are managers making so many losing challenges?",baseball
"I’m really hoping that double play let’s me get this take out without too much negativity. The framing, cross up argument is the first thing that has actually bummed me out all post season. Maldonado was crossed up twice, both strikes. He’s been doing a horrible job framing with seemingly no repercussions. I’m not saying there is any bias, the ump is just awful and almost every call has benefitted one team.",baseball
"For catchers, sure. They have shorter careers/fewer games per season because of the toll it has on your body. Maybe 50 makes more sense there as a rule of thumb.

"Quick note: This situation is exactly why I love NL baseball.

The Dodgers had a 3-2 lead with Ryu coming up. He was at only 74 pitches, could go another 1-2 innings easily.

Dodgers elected to pull him, and got 5 runs out of the deal... but having to now go 4 innings with their bullpen. This is the kind of tradeoff you just don't see in AL baseball :).",baseball
"Yeah, that's a good way to put it. Again, I'm not at all ungrateful that the Yankees are successful, but not meeting expectations feels bad regardless if expectations are to win the world series or just finish above .500. People weren't as upset in that 2013-2017 era because the expectations weren't that high.",baseball
"Strategy as a hitter is different based on the count. Judge was swinging for the fences on what you think should have been strike 3. If the call was correct and he had 2 strikes, he is trying to foul that pitch off.

"Real talk here, I think MLB seriously needs to go to an automatic strike zone. It's infuriating watching pitchers sometimes get 2+ inches off the plate, or throw a dime of a strike and it gets called a ball. This has 100% impacted this game ten fold.

1st and 3rd, nobody out, Cole throws a pitch off the plate that's called strike 1. This enables him to throw his other pitches more effectively since he's ahead in the count already. Same thing with Robles, and now they swing at these pitches off the plate since in their mind it will be called a strike.

Same pitches out of the zone aren't called strikes for the Nats pitchers, as what would've been strike 3 on Correa is called a ball. It was a legit ball, but that was a strike to both Zimmerman and Robles earlier.

That said, amazing how shit the Nats offense has gotten since game 2.",baseball
Smoltz acting like the reason batters used to be able to use more of the field was due to trying instead of just facing much worse pitchers. Pitchers are so insane now batters just try to make as good as contact as possible to get hits since it's so hard to direct hits.,baseball

I'm thinking maybe Scott had the better peak between the two.  He was kind of average for a few seasons before developing a split finger fastball. 

I guess what I'm saying is that the two Mikes should maybe star in a sitcom together.  Rival pitching coaches in the Alaska Baseball League perhaps.  Basically writes itself.",baseball
"Yes he was known in the national circuit, but a lot of teams thought 1st round on a kid who beats up on Jersey backwood dunderheads was too high

There was also the recent precedent of Billy Rowell (who'll unfortunately forever be attached to Mike Trout), a promising position player from South Jersey that the Orioles took with the 9th overall pick in 2006 and turned out to be a bust. So teams were kind of scared of going high on another high schooler in the same region",baseball
"There’s a lane between the first base line and the line drawn three feet outside it in foul territory that the runner is supposed to get into.

That lane is there to let the first baseman see throws coming in and have a chance to catch it. Turner never even came close to heading into it. Since the throw was close to him and not caught, he gets called out and the runner sent back to first as penalty.",baseball
"This had themes of atonement and forgiveness and character, that Galarraga forgave Joyce for the mistake he made. Usually we have to live with our mistakes because there's no one to wave a magic wand to make it all better, no deus ex machina to save the day.

But in this case, there could have been. The Commissioner had such a wand, namely his ""best interests of baseball"" powers.

It could only have been done in this case because it happened with two outs in the ninth. If this bad call had happened with one out in the ninth, then obviously this would have been out of the question as you can't assume Galarraga would have gotten an out after that, even if he had. But there wasn't one out, there were two, and the game would have been over immediately. The change would have been -1 hit for Donald, +1 assist and -1 putout for Cabrera, +1 putout and -5 pitches for Galarraga, -1 at bat for Crowe, and -1 assist for Inge.

And it wouldn't have prevented the aftermath, the moment the next day at the lineup card exchange, as Selig need not have overturned the call right away. He could have let it play out for a week or two or until the All-Star Break or something.

It would have been interesting to hear Galarraga's and Joyce's takes on this question, because it did come up in discussion in the aftermath of June 2. And even more than that I'd be interested to hear Jason Donald's opinion, as it would have been his hit taken away. 

What does everyone else think?",baseball

If Brantley misses the ball and it rolls away, Correa gets to it before judge makes it home. So hes standing at 3rd where he would be anyways if he goes half ways.

Edit: Nevermind, Astros PR statement was idiotic",baseball
No I said in a different comment that McCann led catchers in offense since he became a starter. Not sure the accuracies but Molina wasn’t a good bat until late in his career. I think the main point I’m trying to push is that the writers voting for catchers is broken. McCann is probably a hall of fame catcher. So is Molina.,baseball

"I'm saying he could have said no and nothing would have come of it. 

I'm sure they would have been disappointed but that's it, they're never gonna publicly reprimand a manager for putting his team first in the goddamn world series.

"Fair enough! He deserved to be fired I'm not arguing that. I don't know how to make that clearer. I'm still just saying Osuna still has a job right? So in a sense even though he was in poor taste he was right. She can't do anything about it. They signed him and they are going to keep him lol. 

I get that Osuna didn't do the dv on Astros property or while he was signed with them but they knew about it and still signed him. To me that makes it pretty clear that to the Astros actual domestic violence towards someone isn't as bad as bullying or intimidating someone. If you're a talented player that is.",baseball

Using your example of Dodgers salaries, if you paid them all their annual salaries to throw a game, you'd find you could never bet enough money on the game they're throwing to make up for the money you paid them.

They've been known to reject bets as low as $5,000 when the don't have an established relationship with the better.

"The cost of the ballpark also includes development costs of the entertainment district and multi use development that the team is planning like the Braves did outside their new stadium.

So I imagine we look at the potential free agents next winter and the winter after and decide if its worth gambling on being able to make our money work for us in the future, or if we should just pay what it takes to lock down Cole and never have to worry about it.

You then tell me that I need to do more research.   No, sir, I think it's you who needs to stop spreading false narratives based on your own theories.   There could be many reasons why someone might not choose to pursue charges, the most likely being that they are also guilty of DV themselves.

The lineup was incredible at the end of the regular season, and almost everyone who could have reasonably swapped in was on the IL. Based on their performance so far this year, the lineup was as solid as it could be. What are you supposed to do when half of your best players just stop playing well?

Folty pitched a gem just a few days ago. What sort of planning or managing could have possibly anticipated or prevented this level of implosion?

I guess there's always next year.",baseball
"You're not wrong, but that is an absolutely filthy pitch that I think most umps would call a ball simply because it's nearly unhittable. At a minimum, if Chris Sale threw that pitch, I wouldn't get **too** upset with an ump for calling it a ball.

"I certainly don’t think it’s some MLB conspiracy, unless for some reason they want to drag it out to 7 games, but that’s just devils advocate thinking. I definitely think the umpire did a shit job at key moments and impacted things, no matter what the score was. Saying it was 8-1 so it doesn’t matter is just nonsensical shortsightedness and is more of an emotional reaction than fans calling bad officiating bad officiating regardless of scores.  

I hope at some point, some rule is looked at for playoff games where like 2 or 3 pitches per game can be challenged per team to see if they were called accurately. We have insane slow-mo video available instantly. It’s used to be able to challenge almost everything except pitches. Soccer even uses it with VAR. It’s time to look into expanding it but in a minimal way so it impacts game length as little as possible.",baseball

"Not sure how realistic any of these are, but here goes:

* Don't go through with that plan to contract a bunch of MiLB teams. Stripping Major League affiliation away from numerous small towns and regions can't possibly be good for growing the sport.
* Raise Minor League salaries to a livable wage. Players shouldn't *need* to rely on the generosity of host families.
* No more post-season games on premium cable channels (ex. FS1, MLB Network), as well as putting more games on over-the-air TV. I've always maintained that baseball's reliance on cable subscriptions hurts its accessibility. Comparatively, an NFL fan can watch every one of their team's games on over-the-air TV. I know that carrying 16 games is very different from carrying 162, but my general point still stands.
* Give broadcast contracts to CBS and perhaps even NBC. I've always preferred the way they cover sports as opposed to FOX.
* No more MLB.TV blackouts.
* Emphasize modern stats (in the vein of ESPN's StatCast broadcasts).",baseball

"Yeah, it really goes to show why baseball is such a declining sport, barely top 3 anymore and likely to be overtaken by hockey at least and probably soccer if they don’t do anything. Non-salary capped leagues are inherently flawed, and really off-putting to fans of a team which has the capability of spending only 50% or less of the bigger market teams just makes you really disinterested in the league despite your interest in the sport. Anyone who spouts the bullshit about lower market teams like the A’s, Twins, or Rays making the playoffs should look at their historical win record and record over a long stretch. The MLB allowing certain teams to go 8-12 times the budget of other teams is why the sport can’t even beat the NFL regular season games with their World Series matchups.",baseball
"A leadoff man losing out on an extra base because of a lack of hustle out of the box on a shot to right field that ends up being the difference in game 1 of a postseason series. Where have I seen this movie?

"to add on to 1)

one of the things for which catchers are (increasingly) being rewarded is their ability to ""frame"" pitches; i.e. their ability to receive a pitch that should be a ball but catch it in such a way that the umpire thinks it's a strike. this is something that has obviously always been a skill, but there are some catchers (tyler flowers, jeff mathis) who specialize only in framing and continue to have major league jobs off of this ability alone. in the ""robo ump"" alternate universe, these catchers are immediately out of a job. moreover, the skill set required of a catcher changes instantly. 

the ""human element"" aspect isn't just umpire protectionism, there's also a legitimate reason for players to want to avoid it as well.",baseball
"You are absolutely right. And a lot of minor leagues now use the DH, providing fewer opportunities for pitchers, in particular, to practice the bunt. But you are right - ain't nobody reaching the majors anymore based upon that skill. It's drive the ball or at the very least, be an incredible infielder, or else, you will see the light of day.   
I know the numbers frown on bunting, but when you really need to move the runner over in certain situations, it's frustrating to watch a guy complete botch two straight pitches that should have been both bunted with success.",baseball
"Oddly enough this year if you look at his home/road splits he’s got a 3.10 era at home and like a 6.00 era on the road. 

I do think postseason he’s better cause the style of pitcher he is. He’s very methodical and slows the game down to his pace",baseball

"The advantages the Yankees had entering the series was their bullpen and their defense. Look at all the defensive plays the Yankees robbed from the Twins.

You can’t expect to win a World Series not winning a single game at home.
We still had a full season of damn good baseball.  A team we can be proud of.
Seven World Series games when the series started 0-2.
Chin up.  We have a lot to be proud of.",baseball
"Hindsight is 20/20. Greinke had just given up a home run to Rendon and then walked Juan Soto. Sure, Soto's walk wasn't terribly egregious, but if Greinke was left in and gave up a double, people would be blaming Hinch for keeping him in too long. I would say putting Osuna in instead of Cole was quite the choice, though.",baseball

Thanks for getting some former A's their rings guys! Doolittle, Suzuki, and yes, Rodney too - no hard feelings for pitching like ass for us right before we released you, FRE, lol. 

Crazy that the home team literally lost every game in the series. Not gonna see that again anytime soon!

Also, yeah, gotta admit, I'm glad the Astros lost after that debacle they handled so badly with the assistant GM and SI reporter. Feels nice that they didn't get rewarded after that, in a sense.

"Honestly, a big part of that was just pent up rage from years of having one player in the All Star Game who didn't even play, and not having had any representative in the Derby in 20 years.

From an objective standpoint, Butler would have been a poor choice because he wasn't a good home run hitter at all, even at his peak.",baseball
"A few things there -

1. The nats are careful to celebrate almost entirely in their dugout, not on the field. Davey made a big deal about that when they started dancing after homers. It doesn’t show up the other team as much.
2. The nats are known this year for having fun. Parra, for how overall mediocre he’s been at the plate, is widely credited with bringing this team back into contention with the dancing. So it’s hard to criticize them for it.
3. The criticism of the women was silly IMO to begin with. Probably at least a little bit tainted by sexism too (female “aggression” vs male “passion”, etc). 

So, yeah, you’re right, but I think it’s a step in the right direction rather than letting bad things slide.",baseball
"But these playoff balls aren't juiced supposedly. I'm not sure if there has been an actual increase in these incidents or if its just with the presence of social media that these stories of fans/personnel getting hit get spread around much more. However nowadays so many fans spend a lot of the game distracted by their phone not paying attention to the action that it could result in more injuries. I remember going to a game several years ago when I was still using a flip phone and being appalled at all the people looking at their smartphones instead of watching the game, but now I find myself doing it quite a bit too.",baseball
"I have to disagree. I absolutely remember a *lot* more complaints about dry humping compared to not having somebody warming up. A lot of the complaints were carryover from last season, where it had gotten to a point that there were rumors that players on the team had made that same complaint.

"The line is both in-play over the base and in the base lane, so part of the base is inside of the 3-foot base lane.

"I think it's way too premature to speculate on the HOF candidacy of players like Soto and Acuna and Torres. I don't think you can say a player is on track to make the HOF until they're at least 27 years old outside of the very special talents like a Trout and Griffey.

Only about half of the players on the list have any argument for the HOF. There were players like Grady Sizemore and Eric Chavez and Nomar Garciaparra who were unbelievably good at a young age and then they just fizzled out.",baseball
"This was an even matchup even with the Pineda suspension, which when it went down was the end of our hopes, although I thought the yankees were still beatable. Even with tonight's black magic fuckery the Yankees just played fantastic throughout the series. Berrios and Odo actually pitched excellent games against a fantastic lineup which will get lost. Rocco does need to learn post-season bullpen management - going to your, like, 6th option in Littel in anything other than garbage time was atrocious among a few other odd choices.",baseball
"He was our best player by far. Correlation does not equal causation. The Phillies missed the playoffs because they had a bottom 5 pitching staff, horrible management and terrible regressions from Hoskins, Segura, and a few others. Harper put up significantly better numbers than he did last year. Obviously 300 mil is a lot to live up to but there wasn’t any way for the Phillies to get a player like him without overpaying; that’s just how free agency tends to work most of the time.",baseball

Had a very good lineup besides Miggy with Prince and V-Mart. Who knows what would have happened if the Tigers never gave up those two grand slams to Big Papi and the Flyin’ Hawaiin’ at Fenway, but those are two of my favorite postseason moments ever. Was way too young to understand how meaningful 2004 was at the time, but Papi’s grand slam in this series was “the moment” of his career which I will remember the most. The 2013 ALCS is one of my favorite series ever in general. 

Also, Mike Napoli hit an absolute moonshot to dead center at Comerica off Anibal Sanchez (another pitcher who will play in this WS). That homer didn’t really mean as much as the two grand slams, but it was a bomb.",baseball

If they want to save time, they should make a rule that a pitching change has to occur the moment the manager steps out of the dugout and the RP has to leave the bullpen at the same time. Just get rid of those stupid strolls to the mound and all pitching coach visits, period. Do all your planning/talking over the bullpen phone before the RP is summoned.",baseball

"I remember going from AA to Babe Ruth.  I was one of the best hitters in league, even though our coaches lied to us and said they didn’t keep stats.  But they obviously did because the Babe Ruth league had them and used them for player placement. I remember that first pitch I faced.  80 mph.  I almost shat myself and wanted to quit right then and there. One of the coaches took me to a batting cage that weekend and worked me over a bit.  Soon I was knocking the crap out of them and of course felt cocky.  Then he dropped the speed to 72 without telling and said, “welcome to the world of off speed pitching”.  I soon decided marijuana and vagina was much more interesting than baseball and decided to dedicate my leisure activities in that direction.

In my early thirties I ran into my AA manager at a dive bar.  He was really disappointed to learn that I didn’t get into high school ball.  Told me I was his best hitter ever with a .496 average.  I looked at his hot gf and said he wasn’t doing too bad with those 34C.",baseball

"&gt;I just struggle to understand why it's so surprising. Had the runner been in his lane he would have been safe but he's not even close.

I gotchu. As a right handed hitter the runner would have had to directly change his path to the first pase bath half way to the bag. As a left handed hitter you're already moving towards that path towards first, DOWN the right field line, not through. As a right handed hitter to first it isn't nearly as natural or direct.

Trea Turner was taking the natural path to the ball from his position in the box. You're telling him to make a deviation to NOT interfere with the ball where a left handed batter would have that natural advantage.

A further reminder that the path to first by the runner was not detrimental to the catcher (the fielder in this instance) making an accurate throw to first.",baseball

"The Umpire's Manual is kind of snarky on this one. It dictates that if the runner is not in the runner's lane the entire time, then he is not following the spirit of the rule and shall be called for interference at any point before reaching first base. In fact, in my copy of the Umpire's Manual there is emphasis added to that point.

It's another baseball rule that gets umpires in trouble because 99% of the time the rule is broken and there are zero consequences because it takes the defense kind of fucking up to force the umpire's to make the call. Which is exactly what happened to Sam Holbrook in a playoff game a few years ago too.

And on those two very controversial calls he is almost unanimously considered by his fellow umpires to have gotten two calls correct because, well, they really weren't that controversial.

"&gt; Also the announcer said pitchers try to hit the runner.

Yes, players are taught, ""If the runner is not in the path he's supposed to be, draw the interference.""  It's easy to avoid.  Run in the clearly painted lines.   

&gt; If it’s not the rule, then the rule should be in favor of the runner if another fielder has already possessed the ball (considering you normally have to allow the field to play the ball).

The rule is 100% in favor of the runner.  They're allowed clear and easy protection from interference that doesn't require slowing down or taking extra steps (as getting over 1 foot over a 45 foot path doesn't take extra steps).",baseball

"&gt; then this call is being missed every single game

No, because it only gets called if the runner actually interferes with the catch which doesn't happen very often. Obviously if the runner is inside the line but the catch is still made and he's out anyway, it's not gonna get called (and I don't think it even applies). So in the rare cases that the rule is relevant, it does get called a good amount of the time.",baseball

For Mr. Record, I'm not saying the Astros were breaking the rules to steal signs, only that some are arguing that the Rays were worried enough by that to switch up their signs. Paranoid by them, sure, but I get why. But when you say this:

The mental gymnastics and hyperbole you have to employ to describe following the rules the way you did is how I know I'm on the right side of history here.

Also, it didn't appear to me that Fowler based going for third on Markakis being lazy. I believe he knew that Markakis has a noodle arm out there, and he was going to go for it. He was safe but only by a step, if Markakis had his shit together that's likely an out, and a big play in the inning. But I guess we will never know because Markakis made a lazy fucking play that is just getting a pass.

Edit: also, without a guy on third, maybe Melancon doesn't walk Goldy on 4 straight pitches (if I'm remembering the timing of that AB correctly).

Of course he should serve his suspension, that's good. But the victim refusing to testify isn't an admission of anything, good or bad. Victims refuse to testify for a lot of reasons. Sometimes it's because they realize things got out of hand and it wasn't as big of a deal as they first thought, but other times it's because they fear for their safety. They fear the repercussions they might get from their community. It also might be the victim just wanting to move forward, and leave things in the past.

"I was thinking about this just this week (of course) and I couldn’t help but reflect on teams like Detroit and Atlanta and maybe the Dodgers now that we’re solid for decades and underachieved. At the same time, there are the overachievers, like the Marlins with two titles in a seven-year span. It’s a bizarre sport in that respect, but part of spending is also to stay competitive and remain a draw. In that respect the Yankees have been phenomenally resilient and successful. 

What game 6 reminded me is that no sum of money could buy Rivera.",baseball
"Again, posted this elsewhere, but here:

Osuna was acquired as a “distressed asset” last year because he was serving a 75 day suspension for domestic violence allegations (that were ultimately dropped because the victim wouldn’t return to Canada from Mexico to testify). A reporter was very vocal about this being a bad thing, and would often tweet about domestic violence support during Astros games. Taubman was at least partly responsible for getting Osuna and seemed to take offense at her doing this.

Last weekend, after the game and the celebration had wound down, Taubman saw said reporter and yelled at her half a dozen times “Thank God we got Osuna, I’m so fucking glad we got osuna.” A lot of people saw it, and sports illustrated reported on it after asking for comment from the Astros (who declined to comment).

After the story came out, the Astros PR team released a statement basically calling the sports illustrated reporter a liar and saying the story wasn’t true. After that a bunch of reporters spoke up to verify the story, including beat writers for the Houston Chronicle who rely on club house access for their jobs.

The Astros and Taubman released a half assed apology about “if anyone was offended” which still didn’t seem to admit fault, and the national media picked it up. MLB said they would investigate, and it seems the Astros decided to fire him to try and avoid further punishment from the MLB, but it seems like too little too late.

That’s the situation in a nutshell.",baseball
"I agree. [The statement](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EHcvIdRXkAAm7Rx.jpg) that they released is a much bigger problem for me than Taubman's comments. He's just one guy who is apparently a jackass. If the organization denounces his actions and terminates his employment, then there's nothing to see here. But trying to discredit a journalist who has accurately reported on significant wrongdoing by a public facing employee is detestable. It makes me feel differently about the entire Astros organization, and even as a Braves fan I don't think I can pull for them in the series anymore.",baseball
it could be worse. you could have a stuffed nostril. and then you’re just laying there in bed trying to sleep but you can’t because of how uncomfortable your nose is. and how 2 hours ago your nostril wasn’t stuffed and you could breathe through it clearly with no fucks given and you didn’t appreciate what you had.,baseball
"&gt; lack of trying

No it’s not. I hate this stupid narrative. When I played I would hustle every grounder or routine pop-up. But sometimes you swing and think you got all of it and your natural reaction is to back swing and watch. It’s a bad habit. That’s what it is. Anyone saying he’s lazy or isn’t trying has probably never played baseball. 

Acuña isn’t an idiot. He knows it’s October and knows every run counts. But he’s young and couldn’t shake the habit that day. Just like bad habits cause errors in the field.",baseball
"There's something about this situation that I think is not being appreciated by a lot of people. Yes, Kay enabled Skaggs' (and other players') addiction by hooking him up with pills. He knew that Skaggs had a problem and chose to abet that problem instead of getting him help, and he bears some responsibility for the tragic results of that. But everything we know about this situation also indicates that Skaggs enabled Kay, too. He asked Kay to get him drugs and funded Kay's own opioid addiction. *He texted a man who was in the hospital, recovering from an overdose, about getting him more drugs.*

It bugs me when all the sympathy goes to one person in this story, and all the blame goes to another. I realize one is a famous pitcher we have fond memories of, but that doesn't actually change the moral calculus here.",baseball
"Why would an entire state of transplants, tourists, with loyalties to the Yankees, and others, be baseball crazy when the Rays have spent over a decade telling everyone their stadium sucks, and the marlins are....the fucking marlins?

"Juiced balls are back!

But in all reality, you gotta score on these guys early before they settle in. Max clearly hasn’t settled in (~50 pitches in 2 innings) and Cole threw one mistake to Zimmerman. I am willing to bet the scoring won’t be as frequent until the Nationals bring in their relievers.",baseball
"If it's a ground rule double, it's not in the rule book--by its very definition it is a rule of the playing grounds (i.e. that particular field).

What the rule (5.05(a)(7) if you're interested) *actually* says is:

&gt; The batter becomes a runner when any fair ball which, either before or after touching the ground, passes through or under a fence, or through or under a scoreboard, or through any opening in the fence or scoreboard, or through or under shrubbery, or vines on the fence, or which sticks in a fence or scoreboard, in which case the batter and the runners shall be entitled to two bases.

I mentioned this elsewhere: while I don't have my rule interpretation manual handy, I know there's a definition of what meets the standard for ""sticks in a fence or scoreboard,"" and to my non-Major League interpretation this does not meet the criteria to be considered stuck in the fence, as Bellinger could play it with zero hesitation.",baseball
"I'm not familiar with laws in Texas but there's probably a defamation per se cause of action right? In my state accusing someone of fraud, misconduct, incapacity, or being unqualified in the course of their job may be sufficient although the old timey language (also covers ""imputations of unchaste behavior"") makes me think that you guys probably have some different elements there if it's even a thing.",baseball
"As a pitcher, the quality of a catcher's framing makes a staggering difference. Like you said, sometimes good framing just makes the calls closer to being perfectly accurate more often than it gives you an advantage.

Anecdotally, when I moved from a very good to excellent catcher to a guy who didn't even understand what framing was. It severely limits your strike zone. You have to use more of the plate in late counts, and you lose calls because their glove is moving, etc.",baseball
"Bit of a tangent, but do US baseball fans have any chants/songs other than ""come on x lets go clap clap"" ""lets go x, lets go x"" ""clapclap clapclapclap clapclapclapclap clapclap"" and ""woah oh oh ooh oh""

"I honestly don't know. You could look it up yourself if you want, but sometimes it can be hard to find good statistical analysis for baseball online. Times-through-the-order penalty is definitely well known, though, as is the benefit of velocity. I'm extremely confident that, on average, starters improve on a rate basis when pitching in relief. Obviously, I can't rule out the possibility that this wouldn't apply to certain pitchers, but that should go without saying. I am talking about the aggregate here, after all.",baseball
"I'll preface this with I am the biggest fan of Jesus Christ and his actual teachings.  Not the American version of his teachings sold in megachurches, but Christ's actual teachings.

Beware of the person who uses Jesus Christ as a trump card to explain away their weaknesses.  Only he can find his sobriety.  God and  Jesus Christ can't be used as cudgels to push an agenda.

Hamilton and Bergman have both fallen in their own ways.  My best advice for a public figure who thinks they should proselytize: don't.  Humbly live out every day and consider every decision and opinion with Christ's #1 rule: ""Love they neighbor, no exceptions."".",baseball
"Yeah, but the pitcher expects to get them if the ump has been calling them all game.  This wouldn’t happen with a set left and right strike zone.  Cole wouldn’t be getting them all night either.   Hitters wouldn’t be forced to expand the zone based on whatever the ump felt like calling at the time.   Robots can’t come soon enough.",baseball

"Dodgers based on this season alone. They had a perfect team, great pitching, a good bullpen and unbelievable lineup. To go down to the Nationals in the way they did was just unacceptable. The Yankees, while they were obvious powerhouses, have been lacking pitching this year and a bullpen last year so they were never real “shoe ins” for the WS in my opinion.",baseball

The Yankees still get away with it.",baseball
"&gt; Enablers don't care. 

Not necessarily. Oftentimes, an enabler *does* care and cares a lot about the addict. They just *don't know* that what they're doing is ultimately harming the addict, not helping the person get better/stay safe. Or it might be temporary harm reduction, but something that ultimately keeps the person sick for longer. 

 E.g. a parent paying their addicted adult child's bills so he/she doesn't end up on the street. Or giving their addicted friend/family member money so they don't resort to more dangerous means to get their drug of choice. Or not calling the police when the addict steals from them to get their drug of choice. . 

Its very possible that Kay *did* care. Skaggs is a high profile MLB player. He'd be an easy target for drug dealers trying to rob him, extort him, etc. Nobody outside of baseball knows who Kay is. Hence a relationship was formed.",baseball
"I feel like she was worse. And that shit was just constant.

"Clearly, everything would be based on the front side facing the pitcher.

Feel sorry for him his career ended in a game like this though, but at least he got a ring.",baseball
"I'd say this is double true for a pitcher like Glasnow who essentially only throws two pitches. If a pitcher has a more diverse arsenal then they're probably less likely to make subtle movements like this to tip pitches.

Also have to say you Cards fans and Nats fans are pretty cool in your back and forth between each other.

"So I'll take a shot at this. Assuming a covered area 400x400 you would need 160,000 sq ft of fabric or approximately 17,778 sq yards of fabric. 

You can get waterproof nylon relatively light weight so let's say 1 ounce per square yard. So you have roughly 1,100 pounds of fabric. 

You need rigging and everything else which is going to double your weight so approximately 2,200 pounds. 

Very doable. Even with a large drone. 

The killer is water. How much water will this need to support and shed. Just 275 gallons will double the weight. That's 0.02 gallons per square yard. Not a lot, barely above a mist really. 

Going to 0.1 gallons / square yard makes it more like 5 tons overall which is getting into real size. 

The UH 60L is rated for 9000 pounds. Four should able to do this with some margin. And God lots not pray for wind. At all because that will make this an order of magnitude more difficult. 

Now hourly rate the government estimates is approximately 4k per hour. Time four you're talking 16k per hour. Each game probably needs 5-6 hours minimum of setup, flying and teardown so you're looking at 100k per game there.

"The way LOB is scored by some people is that its cumulative per batter. So if there are 2 men on and 1 out, then someone flies out, thats 2 LOB, then if the next batter grounds out with the same 2 men on, thats another 2 LOB. Thus 4 total.

"I agree. As someone who favors a game that puts the ball in motion that relies far less on the long ball, I believe there are far better arguments to be made, even to those who are strong proponents of home runs and launch angles.  Ball players have a tendency, like fans,  tend to recall the past with warmth. They sometimes disparage changes to the game and the new breed.  This is as endless as time.

Young fans haven't watched as much baseball and haven't lived through as much change. For that reason they may lack the historical perspective of more seasoned fans. This is not a criticism, merely a fact related to age and experience.  Most fans can't remember a time before the DH or when first-place teams advanced directly went from the regular season to the World Series.",baseball

"No, that isn’t the same thing. A manager would never make only right or wrong moves. This was based on the actions of the managers in game. This was again, not a war study. This was something different. But you are hung up on WAR and can’t see the difference so don’t worry yourself.",baseball
"Definitely easy for me to have some small sample size syndrome in some of these. Only 12 PAs for Kepler in his match up, vs 31 PAs for Polanco in his which makes Jorge's number carry a bit more weight in my mind. 

Then you look at the 75 PAs from Gleyber vs the Orioles and remember why his stood out so much and reached such a meme level of bonkers. Devers definitely had a long feast with his 73 PAs against the Jays too. 

Will be very interesting to see what other inter-division killers really hurt their opponents this year, I have a few culprits in mind against my own team.",baseball
"I think in the case of a lazy fly that gets down too quickly for the batter to pass the baserunner, it's really unlikely that an infield fly should be called regardless.  The ball would basically have to be right at an infielder, who would then have to quickly assess the situation to determine whether or not he should catch the ball or let it drop.  And in such an occasion, I'm ok with the defense getting two outs if they can pull it off.  A shallow pop up with two runners on and less than two outs is a terrible outcome for the batter, there's nothing inherently unfair about getting a double play out of it.",baseball

If I'm an Astros fan it's the offense I'm most upset at, not the pitching, grienke did fine against the Yankees offense.",baseball
That's true but a bounceback season from Snell (whose season basically got derailed by a fluke injury where he dropped something on his foot in the bathroom) and a healthy Glasnow can make up for that. Plus their farm is really good including the number 1 overall prospect Wander Franco.,baseball
Nats bullpen issues are overblown. Hudson has been amazing all year and rainey was on fire in the month of September (1 run in 13 innings) then you got vets like rodney and doolittle who aren't scared of the playoffs. All you need is 2 or 3 bullpen arms with the starters they have,baseball

"No that is plainly untrue.  The Dodgers make over $300 million a year in their local TV contract.  The Marlins are ending a contract that pays them 20 mill.  You will notice that St. Louis and Houston are now competitive.  That is because they signed new local TV contracts that pay them $100 mill a year.   Now you are partially right in that the big market teams could pay twice what they pay, but small market teams just can't.  

Now I agree that small market teams, when they are tanking, just stick money in their pockets, they aren't putting money away to pay more when they are competitive.",baseball
"They’re not perfect. Especially because where the ball passes the plate (which is where you’re supposed to call the strike) is not the same as where the catcher catches the ball. Also the camera is at an angle not a straight line between pitchers mound home plate.

"Our guy didn't deserve the out because they didn't catch the fucking ball. Or maybe he deserved the out but the Cards didnt deserve to get the out. The umpires bailed the Cards out on an embarrassing call. Its common sense that a ball in left field (not even that shallow) shouldn't be called an infield fly. It was Hollidays ball all day long. It's blatantly obvious that no double play could have been turned on a ball from a certain distance. Perhaps a solution would be changing the rule to ""if the ball should, under normal circumstances, be caught by the outfielder it shouldn't be an infield fly"".

It sucks that it's ""by the book"" so it's justifiable, but even still its iffy, and at worst a very flawed rule.  Personally I'd say if you have to run 100+ feet OOP to catch a fly ball, it's not ordinary effort.",baseball
"Then you're argument is with the rules of the game and not the umpire. ordinary effort is clearly defined in the rulebook as is the fact that it is not essential for a double play to be likely if the fielder does not catch the ball for an infield fly to be called.

&gt;ORDINARY EFFORT is the effort that a fielder of average skill at
a position in that league or classification of leagues should exhibit on a
play, with due consideration given to the condition of the field and
weather conditions.

Kozma is going after the ball pretty slowly and still camps under it before the ball lands. Ordinary effort essential only excludes exceptional plays like diving catches. Most guys in the league are capable of making this catch.",baseball

It’s subtle. But watch as the ump throws the ball to the mound. He pounds his wrist. Now hidden in the wrist is “the juice” so he’s juicing the balls and that’s why he loves throwing to the pitcher. He has to. He needs to. It’s all for the juice,baseball
Watch for first signs of a pick off and yell back. Keep an eye on the 1B if he’s playing behind the runner. Talk to the runner about the situation. Tell a runner where the ball is as he’s rounding first for extra bases so he has an idea if he’s looking to go three. Etc.,baseball
"I mean, they were 1 - 21 with runners in scoring position for the three home games. Of course we’ll never know as you said and neither of us can prove anything, but that’s some strong evidence. 

But you’re doing exactly what I mentioned earlier. You guys lost as a result of the play that happened on the field. It’s that simple. Were there some bad calls? Sure, but an ace pitcher shut you guys down,  but you’re blaming the umps. It’s so much easier to get mad at some faceless umpire than your boys you’ve watched all year and supported.",baseball
"That's what makes this a tough call. I was an umpire for a while and had trouble with this call, but on this play in particular, it sort of does matter the angle from which Turner came into first.

Thats one way of looking at it. But the blues may have missed the playoffs (i cant remember).

I’ve already said I wished he hustled. Him not hustling is not the point of my comment. My comment pointed out that with how fast the ball got back into the infield, even if he hustled, its a good chance it would have been a close play at second.

This may work Pythagorically in a 162 game season where you often face mediocre pitching, but it just doesn't work in the postseason.

As Joe Torre and the entire late-90s Yankees lineup proved, this plate discipline that can turn you from a great team into an utterly unstoppable force can be taught, practiced and made a priority.

If that's not the case then I don't think it's correct because I think he was directly over the foul line, not inside, when the interference occurred. I literally don't know the true definition of the rule, that's why I asked. I'm just trying to figure out if it was technically correct or not.",baseball

The difference is that Nats benefited on ""small"" calls. Strike 2s of the first or second out or something. But the Astros benefited from ""big"" calls, like inning-ending strike 3s or ball 4s or just balls in general to extend a bat and make our pitchers attack the zone harder which led to big hits.

Talks of a new stadium are getting serious and theres the potential for a solid core of players with the Matts, Semien, and then some young pitching in Luzardo, Puk, Manaea, and Montas. When it comes down to it, the Rays are the only team that have taken pure moneyball and made it somewhat successful. But they still don't have a trophy either and ultimately that's the only metric that matters.

But, I think it speaks to what he values as a baseball player. It’s not the money. It’s his skills and I think he believes Houston is the best place to continually improve and master those skills. And, imo, he’s right. 

As for the Astros chemistry, a lot of teams have great chemistry, but they seem to have that little extra something that is difficult to pinpoint or describe in words. They communicate, try to better themselves, and their teammates. I personally think there’s a difference in being great ball player and having immense baseball intelligence.

Current roster construction shows that managers and front offices will choose extra relievers over extra bench players every time, sometimes to absurd imbalances.

"Well NBA has much more home court advantage, the home team wins 65% of games. Also, there's a much bigger gap between higher and lower seeds, so I'll give the better team an extra 10% boost - so the road team would win Games 1-2 25% of the time, and for Games 3-4 it's 45% of the time. So chances of road team winning first 6 games would be 0.14% ... after 543 NBA best-of-seven series, there would be a **47%** chance that it's never happened. So not too surprising.

For MLB, I'll take your calculation - let's say the chance of a road team winning first 6 games is 0.8%. After 178 MLB best-of-seven series, there's a **24%** chance it's never happened. A little more unusual, but no more shocking than the average player getting a hit.

NHL is the shocking one. NHL has slightly more advantage for the higher seed than MLB, so I'll assume the road team wins Games 1-2 35% of the time, and Games 3-4 50% of the time, for a total of 0.54% chance of 6 road wins in a row.

When small market baseball teams don't achieve a ratings bonanza, it's yet more evidence that ""baseball is dying."" DC might be a decently sized tv market, but they're not really a big baseball market. In 2018, the Nats only did 2.80 locally (still beat the Wizards by 2 to 1).

Yes, NBA Finals ratings have been pretty strong over the last decade. But guess what? All of them (prior to last season) featured Lebron, who is the biggest individual sports star in the US. Last year's Finals didn't take off until the close out games, where they were averaging about 13-14 million per game. And that was with Curry and Kawhi Leonard playing. The Nats vs. Astros is like the Blazers vs. the Sixers. The MLB's ""Lebron, Curry, Durant, etc"" are the Yankees, Dodgers, and Cubs. I'd be willing to bet that a 7 game series between the Yankees and Cubs would beat any NBA Finals in history aside from the Jordan Finals. 

And the NBA never has to run opposite the NFL. I'm not saying baseball doesn't need to do things to improve: electronic strikezone, pace of play, more balls in play, that would give the sport a bit of a shot in the arm, but dying it is not. Baseball popularity has actually increased from 2001, per Gallup. https://imgur.com/a/ucfhjQW",baseball
"His ride with us was short, sweet, and fairly unmemorable. But he did make some good gifs for us that half-year

*edit. Now that I look up his stats, he gave up ONE earned run in his entire time with the Padres, 28 games and IP. Thank you Fernando. AND he gave us Paddack in his trade with Miami. Jesus we owe this guy a lot",baseball
It is my opinion and I think your opinion is wrong as well. Trout is great. He is a blast to watch. Stats are flashy and fun. They really don’t mean shit though. At the end of the day you have to win. You can win 14-0 or 1-0. Stats take a human game and make it a calculation. That’s fun for some.,baseball
"Thank you Nats for exorcising the demon ghost that haunted my Rockies since we got hot in 2007 and then had to wait for the AL and subsequently got cold, getting roasted in four straight games without a single win. You waited off a hot streak and stayed hot, you came out of nowhere and a losing season and as an underdog won the WS against a juggernaut contender in the Astros. You did it through great, smart moves for players, building your team the right way, pitching great, trying year after year to win like madmen, and never giving up. You're truly champions, now my Rockies can rest in peace and hope for next year. 

You won it for the NL who always gets slaughtered in the all-star game. You're a tough, gritty club and I hope one day mine can compare. Congrats.",baseball
"My friend and I would always hang out and ride to our softball games together. One day, we decided to have a couple beers before we went to our game and we both had awesome games. We were tied in the 6th (last) inning and I hit a double, someone flew out to right and I went to third, and my friend walked us off with a base hit. 

We always drink before games now.",baseball
ok. well we just differ philosophically.  I'm not a huge fan of micro-managing type rules.  Each team should be free to do what they see fit. I mean the notion of an extra position player being more fun is an opinion &amp; an opinion that requires artificial extra rules to make a reality.  I prefer the natural abilities of the players and the basic rules to determine what's on the field.,baseball
"I hope, as a Rays fan, you understand how dangerous your 1-2-3 punch is. Especially, if you can get another couple years of production like this, out of Uncle Charlie. 

Glasnow and Snell can build a rotation for years, assuming yall dont trade or lose them. 

At the beginning of the season, I wasnt worried and yall rocked us right away and then fought us to the bitter end.

Im hoping our owner opens the checkbook (Cole) and your team shows that your FO should, as well.

Good season and good luck.",baseball
"I would like to see the best ballplayers out on the field. And when I say ballplayers, I mean people who can hit, field, throw, run bases, pitch and do the things that baseball players do. They are judged on the collective work, not just their ability to hit.

The DH reduces the metric by which to judge a player to simply the ability to hit, preferably for power. And proponents are correct, there is a collection of players who have enjoyed long careers -- or had their careers extended - because of the DH. This provided fans a greater opportunity to watch and appreciate these great hitters.

The detractors of the DH are also correct in that these careers may have been perceived differently -- or cut short --  had they been forced to field their positions. By extending the careers of players who might otherwise not be able to play as many seasons in the majors, other players have certainly been blocked from reaching the majors or had their own careers shortened.",baseball
"I can't tell you how much I would love a behind-the-scenes drama about one (fictional) team's ups and downs and the relationships between its players. You have all these guys with different backgrounds, contrasting personalities, rookies and veterans, all forced to get along as a team while subtly competing against each other, plus travelling and being in one another's company constantly. It's a great recipe for conflict and tension and there are a lot of interesting baseball-related issues to be explored.",baseball
"I’m the same way, only switch my mom and dad. I obviously hated the Giants but didn’t have a problem with the A’s, so I guess that’s how they became my second team. Would’ve been the Angels, but then I found out they don’t like us, so I defaulted back to the A’s.

Other possible answer would be the Mariners cause of my alma mater",baseball
"Yeah, what they said about the season tickets and all that. We went to playoff games in 1995, 2000 and 2001.

The 2003 playoffs sheet is a weird one. They were looking good for the playoffs that year but then gassed it down the stretch and the A’s took the West. You can throw down for playoff tickets and get whatever refund/use it towards future season tickets if/when the team doesn’t make it.",baseball
"I am, too, and it was galling and cynical then to trade for him and it is infuriating now to read this story.

edit to add: even worse, let's say the Astros fire Taubman. You just know some other team is going to pick him up if for no other reason than intel. He's going to get to fail upwards no matter what happens. 

...",baseball
"I mean considering there's been 19? grand slams in World Series history, and there's 9-10 different positions, 4 would be above average. There's so few games played in the World Series relative to the rest of the season that basically any event is historic if you twist it enough (and citing position automatically cuts down the sample by 8/9). Grand Slams are great, and we can and should appreciate them for what they are without attaching some artificially contrived form of significance to them.",baseball
"Yes, but this is talking about being playoff / WS favorites. No one is rationally saying we will be a non-competitive team next year but we need to spend to historic (for us) levels just to try to be as good as we were this year minus Cole.

 Also yes you can have a bad 5th starter; but you can’t have two guys over 36, another guy returning from TJS, an untested rookie, and then one of a number of injury prone and outright bad arms as your rotation and expect to be a WS contender. So yes, if we spend up to the 230 range we should be an elite team.. but if our owner goes the cheap fuck route and just tries to replace these holes with internal options I would say it’s unfair to even consider us favorites over Oakland in the west let alone WS favorites.",baseball
"Because you already have 162 games to earn yourself a full series. Win your fucking Division and stop whining. The wild card being punishing keeps the regular season relevant and the seeding + divisional races critically important. Not to mention in baseball having to wait longer to play *hurts* you so further delaying the DS would put the divisional winners at a disadvantage over whoever makes it through the ‘wild card’ series.

“But it isn’t fair!” No shit. It isn’t supposed to be.",baseball
"It's basic baseball strategy (but it's a complicated-ass game). If you have a 5% chance of throwing the runner out at home versus a 96% chance at the runner going to third, you probably should get the safe out. Scoring one run is much easier than scoring multiple runs (think pinch hitters, runners, etc).",baseball
"That analogy doesn’t do you any favors, since the basic expectation of every position on the basketball court is that they play both offense and defense. There are three positions in major American sports that are so specialized that they aren’t expected to even be competent in other skills, these are goalie, kicker, and pitcher. Meanwhile you’re trying to compare a pitcher to a power forward.",baseball
"&gt;a ""HBP"" that was actually a foul ball, a broken bat blooper, and a walk.

A HBP on a ball well inside that would have been ball four. Combine that with the walk and you got command issues. But I fully agree it's a revisionist take and have little problem keeping him in, especially when it was a strikeout situation with 2 outs.",baseball
"“Everyone who was there”? Who is everyone who was there? The small number of people who are insisting that he was referencing domestic violence. Thats called hearsay, and my point is thats not enough evidence to fire somebody from their job because he didnt say “I dont give a fuck that he hit a woman”, he just said “Im so fucking glad we got Osuna”.",baseball
"There certainly is an argument in favor if it if accuracy is your only concern. What concerns me about it is that it removes yet another piece of the soul of the game. Baseball is a soulful, thinking man's (person's) game. The bizarre obsession with  analytics has done enough damage to the game, I'd hate to see it lose another piece of it's soul to some robot ump. Just my opinion, however.",baseball
"Aware of the rule. It's a matter of enforcement. This isn't called unless the interference is egregious. This was far from egregious.

Speeding on the highway is illegal, too, we all know that. Still, we'd be rightfully pissed if we got a ticket for going a couple clicks above the limit.",baseball
"It’s obvious that the Cardinals were the weakest of all 10 playoff teams, but they won their first series, and because of division alignment didn’t have to play the play-in wild card game.

Would the Braves have been a more equal opponent for the Nationals? Most definitely but it doesn’t matter because they couldn’t recover from some bad luck and bad play to beat STL. 

The Cardinals belong because they won enough to belong. If that stops being the case, they’ll belong at home with everyone else, but not until then.",baseball
"I feel so bad for Twins fans. Not all playoff series losses are the same. In 2007 the Cubs  got swept in the NLDS (they actually got swept, the diamondbacks who beat them got swept, and then the rockies who beat the diamondbacks got swept so you could say they were the worst team that year in the playoffs). It didn't hurt as bad as 03 because they weren't that great of a team so it wasn't unforeseeable. But in 2008 they won 98 games and the whole year that team just felt special. Like they were never out of a game. And then boom 3 straight losses to the Dodgers. When you watch the team you'd spent all summer following just not perform like you know that they can and the whole world buys into the narrative... that hurts. I'm sure Twins fans feel the same way about this loss.",baseball
"There have studies done that show if you apologize you’re far less likely to get sued in the first place. On the factual record they’re likely already fucked, so they have nothing to lose by apologizing and may gain some upside. Also, people who own their mistakes are less likely to get with high damages.

/not legal advice",baseball
"'84 NLCS, after the Cubs went up 2-0 in a best of 5, only to lose 3 in-a-row to the Padres. 

There was some Chicago sportswriter who wrote after the second game that San Diego was a city of losers with no history or tradition, who are sissies who only care about getting tans and having beach bodies. He wrote that the Cubs would of course win because they're destined to, because they deserve it.

https://youtu.be/9fLtowmdR04",baseball
"I feel like he’s probably just straight up ignorant. Probably one of those “just talk to people bro” dudes who has never actually dealt with any issues like that himself. I’m by no means defending him, I’m just saying he might be more dumb than an asshole. But idk I always try and find the best in people so I could be wrong.",baseball
"Remember, Britton had the same injury as Betances and missed considerable time so I wouldn't expect anything from Batances next year. They'll re-sign him and cheap but they're going to have to replace him I think. I agree on Chapman, I don't think he is going to roll the dice either. They need to bolster elsewhere but will they?",baseball
"I don’t disagree, but it’s a lot more difficult to string together good ABs when you have to protect against pitches several inches off the plate because of an unfair strike zone. Cole is an amazing pitcher, and he’s capable of taking full advantage of a favorable strike zone. 

The Nats offense struggling and the bad umpiring aren’t mutually exclusive when the bad umpiring directly influences which pitches can be taken and which have to be swung at despite being well out of the zone",baseball
"&gt;And also, ""Royals, Cubs, Astros, now maybe the Nationals, when the fuck is it the Reds turn? We haven't won a single fucking playoff series in 25 fucking years, I fucking hate baseball and resent everyone else's success""


Last WS series win was 1990, though.  I’d take 30 years of mediocrity if it meant winning a championship.


Your Ohio Bros up I-71 have gotten blue-balls for the 70+ years.  And for forty of those years, the team was also absolute dogshit.  At least you guys have people in town who remember the Big Red Machine.  The only people who remember the last time the Tribe won it all are in the nursing home.",baseball
"The Mariners traded Adam Jones, George Sherrill, Chris Tillman, Tony Butler, and Kam Mickolio. 

The Orioles gave up Erik Bedard. 

Butler never made the big leagues, and Mickolio was a fringe-player for a couple of years. Sherrill was a solid reliever for the Orioles (he made the All Star game w/Baltimore in 2008 and recorded 51 saves over two seasons), Tillman has been a solid starter (starting over 200 games and having 4 seasons with an ERA+ above 100), and Adam Jones has been arguably the best Orioles player of the 2000's (5 All Star appearances, and 3 top-15 MVP finishes). 

Erik Bedard would start 46 games for the Mariners over 4 seasons, amassing a grand total of... *drumroll*... 15 wins.",baseball
"The home run was pretty much his only mistake pitch and with Soto I’m pretty sure he pitched around him. With a low pitch count I would’ve kept him on to face Howie. 

Martinez trusted his best starters and it paid off so I think Hinch should’ve done the same. But who knows maybe Greinke gives up another home run in the inning but I would’ve rolled the dice with Greinke since he was still pitching well. 

Even though Harris was fatigued I don’t think it was a terrible move that Hinch went to his best reliever and he actually threw a decent pitch to Howie. What was more head scratching for me is Cole never entered the game.",baseball

Yeah he usually acknowledges pitchers with a nod or something when they fool him or throw something really nice. The shuffle is probably part intimidation but to me it also just looks like he’s really excited and is getting ready for what he knows will be a good opportunity to get on base. As we saw from his Wild Card Game tootblan he definitely gets excited lol,baseball
"After we won the pennant there were a ton of fans on twitter saying “You’re only a real fan if you’ve done x, y, and z”. I think gatekeeping sports fandom is truly terrible. Is bandwagoning annoying and lame? Yes, but trying to be the authority on who can be a fan is just as, if not more, lame.",baseball
"This guy is a dumbass. You guys are totally in the right to be angry about that. 

He doesn't have flair, but if he's a Houston fan, I guarantee he was complaining about calls for the Texans a couple weeks ago and will be complaining about calls for the Rockets once the WS is over. Hell, I was complaining about calls in the ALCS. 

Sometimes it feels like officiating is out to get your team or your players individually. It's bullshit that a bad call can have such an impact on the game and arguably a bigger impact on the fan experience.

Baseball seems like the sport that is best equipped to benefit from automation and replays. There are like 300 strike zone calls made in a game and it's not fair to the umps to expect them to get all of those right. They are heavily impacted by subjective human issues that a robo ump doesn't need to deal with. Meanwhile, broadcasters are giving real time feedback to the fans on how bad the calls are, using the same tech a robo ump might use. It's a farce.",baseball
"Mostly bullpen management. Game 1 he brings in Cody Stashak who has pitched hardly any high leverage innings all year in a one run game then Kyle Gibson who has been legitimately sick for the majority of the season when we have guys who proved themselves like Trevor May, Taylor Rogers and Sergio Romo in the pen. There was no reason that Taylor Rogers didn't even through a pitch until Game 3 and Trevor May was only used once. That first game was winnable if we'd kept it close.",baseball
"Saw a lot of comments in the PGT both here and r/dodgers about how we're gonna roll right through the NLDS. 

I wish I could say I had the same confidence... Strasburg is still Strasburg, Scherzer is still Scherzer...

If Ryu or Kershaw have a bad outing, they're right back in this thing.",baseball
"I think it's interference for the same reasons you mention.  He also makes contact with the glove BEFORE he touched the base, so the defence that he ""beat the throw"" is incorrect.

HOWEVER...

The rule does state:

&gt; The batter-runner is permitted to exit the three-foot lane by means of a step, stride, reach or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base for the sole purpose of touching first base.

When he does make contact with the glove, it is during his LAST step, which means he should be allowed to be in that area (outside the running lane) because the sole purpose it to touch first base.

HOWEVER...

It's not like he was in the running lane and THEN stepped out of it to step on first base.  He was out of the running lane the entire time.

Which takes precedence for determining inteference?

- Turner being out of the lane the entire time he's running?
- Turner being allowed out of the lane for his final step towards the bag (when he made contact with the glove)?",baseball
What they need to do is add an “approved interpretation” that covers the grey area where the throw is no longer coming from behind the runner and the angle is sharp enough that the throw was clear of the runner. Approved ruling: the base runner may head directly to the base provided he is not intentionally trying to get in the way of the throw,baseball
"I think this is a kind of interesting debate to have. You say it shouldn’t be a part of the game but a lot of people consider it a vital and entertaining part of the game. 

I, personally, agree with you. There’s a strike zone. It’s in or it’s out. It’s not about tricking the ump into thinking it’s something it’s not. But there are those who disagree.",baseball
"I'm not saying it's relevant that he did it to other teams or that makes it ok.  I'm just saying he had done it and that he didn't specifically do it to disrespect them.  Get over it.  Acunas antics seems to be what ticked the cards off but it's dumb because when they got the best of us, they did the same thing.  So it's ok then?  Nobody is complaining or writing articles about how the cardinals are ruining baseball.",baseball
"It was sort of player related. To be more specific as to the nature of the harassment, Taubman (the asst GM) shouted “I’m so f—ing glad we got Osuna!” at a group of female reporters. Osuna being the closer they acquired last year while he was serving a suspension for domestic violence against his girlfriend.

However, considering that Osuna had just blown the save in that game, and no one was talking to or about Osuna to prompt Taubman’s remarks, it can really only be interpreted as him deliberately going out of his way to harass female reporters who he knew were critical of Osuna being on the team in the first place.",baseball
"I got to see Collins speak a few weeks ago, and the man is absolutely hilarious and a great speaker. They’re all legends, let’s be honest. 

Collins also says in his book he thinks Armstrong was absolutely the best choice to take the first step. Take from that what you will, heh",baseball
"The years that an NL East pitcher didn’t lead:

2012 - RA Dickey was 2nd and Gonzalez, Zimmerman, Hamels, Medlen, Lee, and Buehrle were 4-9

2013 - Cliff Lee was 2nd, Fernandez 3rd, and Harvey 6th

2014 - Cole Hamels 3rd and Roark, Zimmermann, and Fister were 6-8and Alvarez 10th

2015 - Scherzer 4, deGrom 6, and Harvey 8

Summary: The NL East has dominated pitching this decade",baseball
"This is the epitome of ""stealing a game on the road."" Our pitching was not at its best over all but we managed to get Cole on an uncharacteristically off night. Oddly enough, it was the very thing I was worried about, our bats, that saved the day. Juan's performance was especially inspired when you consider [his lackluster NLCS performance.](https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2019_NLCS.shtml)  

So happy our guys were able to get this one. Hope to see Stras on his A-Game tonight - gonna need it with Verlander on the bump.",baseball
"Imagine pulling Grienke after 80 pitches, 2 hits, and mostly weak contact all game, because the hottest hitter for the Nats went deep and Grienke didn't get the call on a blatant strike? I knew as soon as he got pulled the Nats would rally, although I didn't predict the instant kill. This loss is all on Hinch. He way over thought the situation, and proceeded to kill any and all momentum the team had. The Nats struggled against Grienke all series, the one pitcher they couldn't get to.

Congratulations to the Nats and the fans. After years of disappointment, not just with the Nats but with the Caps up until a couple years ago, the city has finally had a taste of the championship life. It was refreshing to see a World Series without the ""Original 16"", and this series will go down as a classic for so many reasons. 

I'm sad as a kid who grew up watching the Killer B's in the 90s and the revamped version in the 2000s, but happy with the core going forward with this team. And I'm so happy that the Yankees didn't win yet again.",baseball
"Honestly I'm with you. Unpopular opinion in this sub who is going so far as saying they hope the guy ""loses his job and dies on the street."" I wasn't there so maybe it was really severe, but we do not get any quotes of the hecklers (other than the ""DONALD"" chant) but this would never occur at a hockey game. The player would either chirp back to the fan or ignore it and that'd be the end of it. Getting thrown out for throwing stuff, I get it. Getting thrown out for excessively crude if there's small children around you, I get it. Getting thrown out for trash talking, seems like that could easily spiral into a grey area.",baseball
"lol yuli got caught on camera doing racist shit in the dugout during the world series, and he didn't have to serve his suspension till the next season. davey will probably get a few days to serve in april but if they don't suspend you mid-world-series for racism, i doubt they do it for manager tirades.",baseball
"I have an idea, why don’t you watch a few games from both teams histories (big games) so you start to understand their history a bit, and maybe one will speak to you more than the other? I’m sure fans of both teams could point you to some must-watch games",baseball
"If I remember correctly, Greinke had the Yanks in his no-trade clause. Something about big cities/diehard fans. He doesn't like pressure. Knew that going in, and coming off a dominant ALDS sweep of a 101 win 307 HR team was confident we were going to win.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: The teams NOT in the no-trade clause:  Atlanta Braves, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians, Houston Astros, Kansas City Royals, Milwaukee Brewers, Miami Marlins, New York Mets, Pittsburgh Pirates, Seattle Mariners, Tampa Bay Rays, Texas Rangers and Washington Nationals",baseball
"I'm going to be worthless with online resources here, but on an off chance, do you happen to live near any minor league teams at any level? Because, while it may be a long shot, it is the offseason and reaching out to someone in the organization at least has a chance of getting a good starting point from their end. I'd never expect them to let good trade secrets out to a random person off the street, but I feel like this would at least be my own starting point, then I'd spread out from there.",baseball
"I’m gonna say Twins losing a billion in a row. The wildcard game is very top heavy and if you have a deep roster of solid pitchers instead of one amazing ace for instance then you’re gonna have a tougher time. Also I think the pressure is more severe being that it’s an elimination game every time.

Twins have had multiple chances in multiple series with multiple non-elimination games and can’t put together a win.",baseball
"So the question becomes what is more important, ratings at the beginning of the game or ratings at the end? Right now, everyone sees the beginning but they lose a lot of fans halfway through as people go to bed. The flip side is the west coast misses the start but all time zones see the finish.",baseball
"What a disgrace!  That's not how you do it.  Let's talk about proper heckling, shall we? Never make it personal, and keep it above the line.  How about some examples?

· Hope you like batteries, cause you're going back to triple A!

· Go start the bus!

· Maybe you're left-handed and you don't know it?


Everyone loves an entertaining heckler!  Don't be a DICK!",baseball
"I don't think it would heavily affect small market teams more. It takes more than three batters for someone sitting on deck or in the dugout to acclimate to a pitchers style, and really you don't get a true feel for it unless you're in the box, so rotating a new pitcher in every inning would have basically the same effect without needing to have mid-inning pitching changes.",baseball
"This is always been my thought, as misguided as it may be....it's like the speed limit. Whatever it is, people will take it further, so you have to set the threshold lower than you want it. Everyone knows you can go 65 in a 55 and not get caught, but you raise it to 65 then everyone is going 75.

You allow stickum or pine tar, it's now easier to use more of it and then you've got a spitball situation going on, which no one wants.  If the rule is none, then you have to be so careful in your use pitchers can gain a little grip but they're not taking it too far and altering the motion of the ball.",baseball
"Well yeah, it helps when you have the goat HC/QB combo for 20 years and not much competition in the AFC.

Can't wait for Brady to retire in 10 years and then BB finds Brady 2.0 from some college nobody's ever heard of in the 2029 draft. Then they proceed to go on another 20 year run.",baseball
"When we were in the playoffs, the team didn't have to run Facebook ads to desperately try and sell out the stadium.

I get it. I live in DC and I bandwagoned the Caps on their run. At least they actually have fans though. How many of the people in that stadium know the name Chad Cordero or Jose Vidro? How many saw a game at RFK?

And why do none of you come out in the regular season?",baseball
"1st order is pythag record, it's based on how many runs you scored and gave up.

2nd order is based on projected runs based on the underlying stats.

3rd order is based solely on the underlying stats in a vacuum and adjusted for quality of opponent, it's supposed to weed out the luck of ""cluster hitting"" (when you don't get as many hits, but somehow they always come together). So if you got lots and lots of cluster hits (*cough* Yankees and Braves) and your opponents managed to not get cluster hits, then your 3rd order will be much worse than your normal record.",baseball
"Some of them are good--like the ump in Game 1.  Cederstrom was not good and those low strikes that he took away from Sanchez had a disproportionate influence on the outcome of the game.  Sanchez needs the knee-high strike to be successful.  If you take that away from him, he's hamstrung.",baseball
"Maybe I can’t take him seriously as a manager when 3 years ago he was walking up to ‘forever young’, riding motorized scooters, being called Grandpa Rossy.

"Have you watched any NFL game lately?

It's all:

""Look at all these holding calls, the league has to do something about this.""

""Is that really roughing the passer? Looked like a good clean hit to me. 10 years ago that'd be nothing.""

""These PI challenges are ridiculous, nobody knows what is considered egregious.""

""That was infact a helmet to helmet hit and I understand the league is trying to protect it's players but a few years ago that was just a good hit.""

""Does the NFL even know what a catch is!?""

And are you kidding me? 90% of everything a retired NBA player who is now on TV says is ""the game is way too soft these days.""

Maybe people just like to complain. Maybe commissioners like Goodel and Manfred just suck and need to be criticized.",baseball
"They've been all pretty mediocre all year. The Cards had a hot streatk around August that helped them sputter across the finish line. 

Of the three, the Cubs probably had the best roster, and that's something I'd stand by, they just underperformed the worst, dealt with a lot of injuries, aging pitching, and inconsistent offense and bullpen. And it cost them, a lot of extra innings games, a lot of 1 run games. They should have been better this year, but weren't. That's baseball for you.

At the end of the day, all three teams were just slightly above average",baseball
I feel so sorry for your ballclub. Start a season 12-0 to give your fans the tiny bit of hope they already have and then blow the season and go 30 games below .500. Would've been nice to see the M's in the postseason but what can I say? Baseball is ruthless.,baseball
"The way baseball is set up makes dynasties unrealistic, look at the red Sox ws win years. Its not every year and its not even near nonstop ws visits.

Seeing patriots in the super bowl every year is annoying. Same with golden state. I'm sure the first couple of times the teams made it, people probably genuinely loved it. But once they were all anyone saw for years, it kind of lowers the fun of watching, it just screams that one entire conference has almost no parity.",baseball
"So I think everybody hates this because, hey, fuck anybody who thinks *less baseball* is better baseball, but does anybody else hate it for math reasons?

Pitching wise and rest wise yeah they are in better shape but saying we're limping into the series? Lol come on man. Verlander's second start was only 3 and 2/3 with 74 pitches. He'll have 4 days rest as well. Cole clearly doesn't need rest. It's a whole different ball game. Literally. The Rays had the Yankees number this year and to say the Astros can't go toe to toe with them is laughable. Also Verlander game 1 was amazing.. Lol what the fuck are you talking about?,baseball
"This. 100%. The epidemic is cut out lives all across North America. I don't see why top tier athletes are immune to this.

"Gary Carter, Carlton Fisk, Yogi Berra... also, fWAR now includes framing and even that has Yadi 3rd among active catchers, and only 1.3 wins ahead of Posey. Yadi had a 6 year peak by fWAR that went 4.5, 5.1, 5.0, 5.9, 7.7, 7.8 before he fell off considerably - we've seen better peaks from Lucroy, Posey, Brian McCann, and Joe Mauer, and may yet from Grandal, just to go with some recent guys.

I find it weird how this consensus has formed that he's far more of a HOFer than any of them aside from *maybe* Posey and Mauer. Nothing tangible supports that, and the arguments over intangibles are just hearsay that's been repeated so much that a lot of people seem to accept it without evidence.",baseball
"The biggest difference between the 30 seconds of down time between plays in football versus the 30 seconds of downtime between pitches in baseball is that, in football, you can see a lot of the strategization going on via the offensive and defensive personnel/formations/motion/adjustments.

You can see strategization between pitches to *some* extent in baseball, where you can *sometimes* look at runners’ leads or defensive shifts or the like, but the reality is, even for the most avid and attentive baseball fan, 95% of the spectator experience of the time between pitches is nothing at all but waiting for the pitcher to pitch.

tldr, the inter-play downtime in football has more that’s observable for the fan than the inter-play downtime in baseball.",baseball
Objectively lifting the pitcher in a 1-0 game for a pinch hitter is a good choice most of the time at that point in the game. Especially when Folty is a black hole at the plate. Snit actually made a really questionable call by not pinch running for McCann in that situation. McCann ONLY scores from first on a homer there.,baseball
"Well, there’s a few things that transcend “court of public opinion.” 

1. The MLB conducted its own investigation and suspended him. There are legal ramifications for doing this without evidence or with flimsy evidence. 
2. Toronto supported the decision.
3. The MLBPA didn’t grieve the decision. This is key here because this is an entirely player-centric organization of union delegates, lawyers, and former players who exist solely to fight for the player, and they chose not to. 

Additionally, it’s pretty common that charges are dropped in domestic violence cases where there are kids involved. Could be the plea deal involved money, could be she didn’t want to keep going from Mexico to Canada every couple weeks. Either way, the suspension, the comprehensive lack of appeal, the mandatory counseling, and the restraining order are all pretty clear evidence of wrongdoing. This is why nobody is debating whether or not the crime was committed, but only whether the punishments and backlash were fair. 

If you want to believe that no crime was committed in the first place, I’m certainly not going to work to change your mind. Also, Kap wasn’t blackballed either, he just wasn’t talented enough to keep his job the way Osuna is.",baseball
"2017 series had better viewership than 2018 though, even with the more popular Red Sox in it. And before you say it's cause it was a closer series, it had more viewers on a game by game basis. Game 1 was more than game 1, game 2 more than game 2, etc.

Viewership is just down in general. Both the Astros and Dodgers were new in 2017. Then the Dodgers made it again and everyone's seen the Red Sox in one so it went down. And now the Astros are in it for the 2nd time in 3 years and the other team is the Nats, who aren't nearly as popular of a NL team as the Dodgers are. 

So yeah it's not surprising at all.",baseball

"Serious question for your techy guys:

I just stream all sporting events for free from the streaming subs here and then I use the free TV show/Movie apps you can load on a firestick which will give you any tv show and movie ever made in history. All of these streams come in 720p, 1080p, and occasionally 4K options.

I also have one of those small square indoor antennas which give me all the major networks in perfect HD.

So I'm curious as to why everyone doesn't use these obvious free methods instead of paying for streaming services like Hulu, Sling, YT TV, PS Vue, Netflix, Prime, etc.?

The only thing I pay for monthly is internet service which is like $30 and I haven't paid for anything else in over 5 years now because everything is available for free. And since I'm not downloading any of the content I stream, it's perfectly legal.

Am I missing something here?... I can't be the only person doing this, right?",baseball

"Bryant’s case is that by hitting free agency a year later than he could have is that the Cubs FO cost him millions of dollars.

In 2016 he made $652,000 and took home the national MVP award after the season. 2017 was the first time he was being paid over a million dollars. So the reigning best player in the national league was barely making twice the league minimum. Of course even league minimum in 2015 is ten times what the average American makes per year in 2019 but the argument isn’t that he’s not making enough, it’s that the Cubs cost him money.",baseball

Yeah it’s a probability distribution of outcomes. Plenty of pitches could be good if they didn’t happen to be hit by a great swing (or a shit swing that just happened to work out) and plenty of pitches can be bad that are whiffed at or popped up etc. One of the biggest annoyances is when you here the “he pitches a great seven innings and just made two mistakes all evening” (I.e the two homers) which is not at all how it works!,baseball

"I gotta make sure to read this. I haven't been happy with the volatility of the stat, but that's more so BBRef's problem for how they compute DRS as the main variable into their bWAR variable. It could be all on BBRef's shoulders for allowing three volatility of DRS to impact bWAR so much.

Edit:

&gt; If a batted ball is estimated to be a high percentage out, but a fielder isn’t close to it, then the team will get penalized in the form of Positioning Runs Saved—but the fielder will not.

I fucking **LOVE** this PARTs concept and how they're implementing it.

Edit 2:

&gt; What doesn’t get included [in Matt Chapman's 34 DRS] is positioning, and the system calculates that Chapman accumulated -13 Positioning Runs Saved (-10 in non-shifts, -3 in shifts). Again, this number will still be included in the team total, but the individual player will not be penalized for it.

"I can see the Trop from my house.

It's not the size of the municipality itself that matters, but if it did, consider that Pinellas County has over a million residents, while Milwaukee County has about 950,000. Milwaukee as a city is larger than any city in the Tampa Bay area only because it is a consolidated city-county. Consolidated city-counties have inflated populations because their large borders encompass suburban and rural areas that traditional cities do not (which is why Jacksonville rather than Miami is the largest city in Florida).

The Trop may have the smallest number of people within 30 minutes, but the fact is that there is nowhere in the Tampa Bay area that would not have the smallest number of people within 30 minutes. There are about 3 million people in the Tampa Bay media market, but the market covers a land area twice the size of Puerto Rico, larger than Rhode Island, Delaware, or Connecticut, and nearly as large as New Jersey (bigger than New Jersey if you include Hardee and Highlands). The problem isn't St. Petersburg, it's the entire Tampa Bay region.

Teams in areas this sparsely populated need a history of success (the Rays are 25th in all-time win percentage, 28th in division titles, tied for 24th in pennants, 27th in postseason appearances, 26th in all-time batting average, and 28th worst all-time ERA) or superstars (the Rays have only one HoFer who was already washed up while here and regularly have an extremely low payroll). Winning by itself doesn't matter; people like the idea of unheralded one-shot underdogs like Leicester City or the Indians of *Major League*, but they're not willing to support a team long-term that doesn't hold onto or acquire famous players. Being regularly competitive with a constantly changing team of virtual nobodies doesn't breed enthusiasm.",baseball
"Genuine question. Why is there even a homeplate umpire calling pitches when we clearly have all the technology, viewable to all spectators in real time, to make the right call...with all the cameras at every base, with every angle imaginable, why in the hell do umpires still exist?

&gt; 9.06  Determining Value of Base Hits

&gt; (a)  ...it is a one-base hit if the batter **stops** at first base; it is a two-base hit if the batter **stops** at second base; it a three-base hit if the batter **stops** at third base; and it is a home run if the batter touches all bases and scores.

"It was a cool October morning in 1998 the day Rosalia saw it. Well, cool for the Dominican, at least. An approaching hurricane had filled the air with crisp tension. That’s what Rosalia assumed everyone was excited about as she entered the town square, where a crowd had gathered. Then she noticed at their center was a figure she couldn’t quite make out. As she got closer, someone in the crowd saw her and excitedly waved her over, “Doctor! Doctor!” Rosalia had been the only doctor in this place for many years. As she approached, she realized the figure was a young woman—holding a loosely swaddled child. The crowd pointed at the child excitedly, and at first Rosalia didn’t understand why. Until a gentle breeze, from that coming storm, moved the blankets, revealing something she thought impossible. Large, and *golden*, glistening in the Caribbean sun. The boy was more like a sculpted idol of an ancient god than a child. She had read of this in a textbook many years ago, but she always thought it a myth. She mumbled her diagnosis: “El tiene gran energía del bicho.” The crowd whispered her words back at her in awe. Rosalia met the young woman’s eyes. “¿Cual es el nombre del niño?” Smiling softly, the new mother responded: “Juan.”",baseball
"I mean, I think it's 100% inexcusable. I can't believe it's still an issue. I figured he'd've learned by now and would understand, especially in the playoffs, that it's inexcusable. I just don't think it was part of the reason we lost.

I think we lost because we gave Keuchel a quick hook. Because we used Greene early in the game and because Martin got hurt. Because we suddenly decided to change how we run our bullpen and use Fried for a random inning, in addition to the Greene question. Because Markakis was slow to get the ball in, and because we hadn't replaced him as a defensive substitute already. Because we had three plays go the wrong way by a fucking inch--the Cards two late doubles and Ozzie being out by the tip of a cleat. Because we left Melancon out too long instead of bringing in another guy when he was bleeding runs in the 9th. Because of the bullpen's performance, generally.

After all of those reasons, sure. Maybe him not getting to second possibly cost us a run when he got doubled up--but that's assuming that Markakis got a hit, which wasn't a sure thing. That's pretty low on the list, IMO.",baseball
"As random and uncertain as the game of baseball is, hustle is probably the only 100% guaranteed thing about it. No matter where you hit a baseball, you are 100% in control of how hard you run the bases. Acuna was in control of that, and he decided to watch a ball at the expense of his team. Doesn't matter if you try to make up for it later, you still failed to provide your team with the hustle that gives them the best chance of winning the game",baseball

"NGL, Instant Replay is one of the biggest reasons why I can't enjoy watching football the way I used to.

The stuff they use is clear now for the most part though so you can’t directly see it as well like you would pine tar (one substance is a sprayable sun screen).

"I disagree with your assertion that it's an edge case. Benefit of hindsight sure, but they did drop the ball and didnt even get one out. If you cant tell that a double play isnt being turned right there, you shouldn't be an umpire.

Like you said, the umpire has a lot of freedom on a call like this. He knows the point of the rule and has the freedom to call it based on that interpretation. Nobody is upset and screaming for an infield fly to be called if he doesnt make that call. 

It is justifiable, and might have even been the right call (I wouldn't say either way with 100% confidence) but I also always come down on the side of no call if its absurdly borderline and you have the power to make it and no call and to let the skill of the players determine the outcome of the game with as little input from the umpires as possible. 

Don't tell me to ""fucking deal with it"". I know umpires aren't going to always be right, but fuck that. Like I said, umpires should be involved as little as possible and Holbrook took a call that could've easily (and probably should've) gone the other way and made it his show.

"There's an approximately 0% chance that happens. I assume Hudson for the 8th, Doolittle for the 9th. The point of Corbin is that the Nats have very few bullpen arms they can trust, and we needed to bridge the gap to them since Scherzer was knocked out early.

Edit: sorry, my tone was pretty rude. I'm just a drunk and stressed Nats fan",baseball
She’d love watching a game with my mom. My moms concerned with pitch count because most of our staff is just falling apart with injuries. Finally got to show her Mad Max in action and she was saying they had to pull him in like the 4th bc he threw 50 pitches.  Then any pitcher who got near 100 blew her mind. Tough telling her that’s just a privilege we don’t have at the moment,baseball

"Harvey pitched poorly for the Mets, but that's not why he was DFA'd.  He was still a major league quality pitcher at that point, as evidenced by his 4.14 xFIP and 1.7 fWAR for the Reds the rest of the season.  He was DFA'd because he wasn't taking things seriously.  I think this tweet summed it up nicely: https://mobile.twitter.com/anthonydicomo/status/991405484036026368?lang=en",baseball
"No, no pasta. Oddly enough, that is the same SI article that used some of my research.   


I asked if you were related to anyone involved because I've never before heard a one-sided take on the story (other than from Tonya and her family), so I was curious if you were more deeply connected than the average fan.",baseball
"As long as Acuna doesn't come out and brag about not hustling, then proceed to try and break the ankles of first basemen, I think he'll avoid the vast majority of the negativity that could come his way....

except on reddit.  We look at hate like normal people look at oxygen.",baseball
"No, you just repeated the same thing you've said over and over. You never told me where my logic was wrong.


If you lose game 6 or game 7 you lose the series


So game 6 and 7 have the same consequence, the same thing is at stake: losing the series


So if the outcomes of losing game 6 and game 7 are the same, losing the series, they are equally important. 


Where do I lose you? Which of those steps doesn't compute for you?",baseball
"Reading through the list line by line, I stopped and thought for a bit. And concluded ""na, that Freese moment is still more memorable""

That Joey Bats bat flip tho? God damn I'm not even a Blue Jay's fan and just thinking about that moment gets me hype. Idk man, that might be my choice.",baseball
"What is it with Yankees fans and pouring beer on female Astros fans. My daughter lives in NYC. She went to an Astros game at Yankee Stadium last season with friends of hers THAT ARE YANKEE'S FANS and towards the end of the game, some dude sitting behind her poured half a beer out on her, dropped a ""fuckin Astros suck"" and left. 

So fuck the guy at Minute Maid and fuck these guys wasting $20 beer.",baseball
"A thought just occurred to me: if the Nats win tomorrow and Corbin turns in a performance in the vein of what Sanchez/Scherzer/Strasburg have done so far, I feel like you would have to have a four-way series MVP split between them? It sounds crazy but if that were to happen it would feel right.",baseball
"My point is more that once you get to extras you don’t know how long the game goes, so I’d rather Cole able to go multiple innings than burn him for 2 outs in the 7th.

Cole is great in his role, but Harris and Osuna are great in theirs. There’s no guarantee that going to Cole on 3 days rest out of the bullpen for the first time since college would have gone well.",baseball
"I remember being genuinely surprised at Turner Field seeing those year signs over left field and figuring out the colors meant they only won one of those World Series.  

Have to be the absolute best team in the ever in baseball to have just one ring. My God--Smoltz, Glavine, Maddox, Jones...how did they not win more?!?!",baseball
"It’s been the most exciting on field, but it doesn’t have any external narrative going on for them to build up around it. WC v Top Seed going to 5 has a lot of inherent narrative they can talk about but yeah they should be talking about how insane your guys games have been.",baseball

"Simple, he was diagnosed in his home country to have ADHD, he takes amphetamines for his ADHD, and when he came to the MLB a panel of 3 experts approved his use of Adderral for his ""history of ADHD"" under a player's rights for usage of a ""medical need"" overriding it being on a banned list of substances 

It is extremely commonplace",baseball
"It's just bad luck with timing and positioning. A little to the left and they don't touch, a little to the right and Yuli reaches in the baseline and it's not interference, a little earlier or later they avoid each other too. It's a freak play, I won't lie, but technically the correct call.",baseball
"The fact that you even would refer to anyone seriously as a neck beard shows you spend too much time on reddit 

Also your right I shouldn’t disagree with any move a team makes. I should just sit back and accept that I’m a big dumb idiot that knows nothing about baseball and never complain",baseball
"Results oriented thinking/playing captain hindsight is pointless. They made the right decision with the information they had at the time.

Roll the dice on Ottavino pitching to him 1000x and Green doing the same and I bet it looks a lot prettier for Ottavino. If you make the right choice and it goes sour anyways, all you can do is shrug your shoulders and move on.",baseball
"The Rays are dominating this game and we have PROOF

Charlie Morton has to face 9 guys with wood sticks and it doesn’t look good 

But the Rays have scored 5 runs, CINCO! Oakland? Only 1 jog

HOW DOES TAMPA BAY DO THAT, with power and precision 

Next-Gen Stats powered by Amazon Web Services

AWS is how",baseball
"now you’re just making things up. he clearly looked at the ball after catching the bat, and THEN started his trot. he didnt start his trot until AFTER he caught his bat and AFTER he had seen the ball was fair. stop reaching so hard. you made a guess and you were wrong. you’re literally making things up by saying he didn’t look at where it was landing.",baseball
"Everyone talks about the starting pitching for the Nationals, and rightfully so, but they sleep on the lineup. Our lineup can hit. It was the second best in the NL and they've now roughed up Jack Flaherty and Gerrit Cole (and Clayton Kershaw, although October makes this count less). The lineup won this game, not the starting pitching.",baseball
ok so jose altuve for example automatically supports this behavior? do you want him to just hang it up right before the world series because of this? quit with dumbass shit like this be logical. the rest of these players are not at fault and are just trying to do their job.,baseball
"The Nationals laid a goddamn plague onthe Cardinals in very way. If memory serves, the Nationals out hit the Cardinals 20 to 6, and they also very nearly got no hitters in two consecutive games. Both Aníbal Sánchez and Max Scherzer tore the Cardinals to pieces and made their hitters look, quite frankly, like garbage. In addition, the Cardinals pitching looked horrible. Pitchers like Adam Wainwright and Jack Flaherty, normally can tear shit up, were extremely ineffective. Regardless of how they did it, and despite me really really hating their team, I'll still extend congratulations to the Nationals for getting to their first ever World Series. Good luck, y'all.",baseball
"&gt;Star player leaves because he wants more cash then what I'm willing to give him

Its like my entire time playing Football Manager has been condensed into this Nat's season.",baseball
"I thought we were Th/Fr then Sunday/Monday with possible game 5 on Wednesday. The series is scheduled for Oct 3-9. Is it scheduled for game 5 (if necessary) to be back in LA the day after game 4?

E: I just checked. According to MLB.com games are 10/3, 10/4, 10/6, 10/7, and 10/9",baseball
"But I don't want to see the drumming/vuvuzela/etc tradition of A's fans end, were that to happen! To me, that's the best thing about watching an A's game on TV. I still worry if the A's move to Vegas, that this tradition might no longer be as big to see for their games.

What can I say, except that I worry the current Rays owner wouldn't keep the drumming/etc tradition going, were both teams to trade places in where they're located.",baseball
"Yankees with runners in scoring position during the regular season: .294 (best in MLB)

Yankess with runners in scoring position against Astros: not .294 
These past 3 games have been lost by poor hitting. If/when we lose this series some questions are going to have to be asked about several hitters.

Good luck Houston, you've got a great team and you have earned a world series appearance",baseball
"Because you’re leaving me no choice:

All the trash talk aside, I couldn’t think of a team I’d be prouder to call my rivals. We chirp, get at each other, it’s a year-round thing. But when something bigger than the game happens, when it doesn’t matter who plays who, the Yankees are always the first ones to step up and have our backs. And Fenway hates seeing legends like Mo and Jeter leave the game, at the end of the day, they’re a classy organization.",baseball
"Although, I'd bet almost all of the MLB-level players who are religious came from a religious background even before they made the bigs. 

Still, I can imagine some 12-year-old religious kid praying to make the big leagues – and then when he does, he's like, ""Wow, thanks God!"" And plus, many of his new teammates and coaches are like that too, so there's kind of a mutually reinforced belief system.

(It might be interesting to look at the religious beliefs of all the former Little League/high school players who also prayed to make the MLB but didn't.)",baseball
"The Nationals were down by 2 with 4 outs to go against the Brewers. They came back and won.

The Nationals were down by 2 with 6 outs to go against the Dodgers. They came back and won.

The Nationals had to win 2 games on the road against a team that lost just 21 home games all season. They were down by 2 with 8 outs to go. They came back and won.

This team did not quit, no matter how much the odds were stacked against them. They had the fight of champions, and now they are champions.",baseball
"Congrats to the Nationals on an amazing season. If you don’t win the World Series, I think most people would want to lose to a team that is likable. And that’s what we did. Nothing but respect to that team and their fans. I’d be lying if I said I hated any player on that roster.",baseball
"I've been watching baseball 50+ years and I have never seen...will probably never see....a team like this Nats.  Its unreal this run how they came back when they should have been dead.   Maybe the 69 Mets come close but this was truly an Amazing run we probably won't ever see again.

Congrats Nats!",baseball
"I don't really watch any other sport but the awful Redskins, but man this was enjoyable.  I used to go to Orioles games a lot as a kid, but they mostly sucked shit too.  I'm from just outside of DC but I put on the bandwagon flair because I jumped all up on that bandwagon.",baseball
"I just hope no one is crazy enough to go and ""take care"" of Hinch.  Yes his decision not to leave Grienke in cost them the World Series.  Hinch pulled a Joe Maddon.  You leave your hot pitcher until his fucking arm falls off.  Yet, the bullpen fucked their starting pitching.  4 homes games and the fucking bullpen fell apart.  Still, the Nationals wanted it more and didn't choke under pressure.  Getting those runs late in innings shows a title winning team.  Scherzer and Strasburg carried that team period.  For the Astros if you can't get runners home with position you won't win shit period.",baseball

that level of over-the-top celebration for a solo home run in the bottom of the 9th when you're down by 10 runs is just super tacky  lol

"Yes, only one I know of but has to be more but let's look at that Yankees team:

Girardi C

Tito 1B

Mariano Duncan 2B

Jeter SS

Boggs 3B

Bernie Williams CF

Paul O'Neill RF

Ruben Sierra DH

On the bench, Leyritz, Strawberry, Fielder, Raines

Only excellent starter Pettitte

Wetteland and Mariano were lights out in the bullpen

The Braves had 3 great starters but they had no shutdowns in the bullpen like the Yankees' two. They had good hitting, but not as good. And their defense was nowhere near as good except for their pitchers. Yankees also had that Yankees swagger. Don't see it myself.",baseball
"Fine, has there ever been an instance of multiple pitchers combining to strike out the side on 9 pitches? We won't call it an immaculate inning. As far as I can tell all research focuses on 1 pitcher striking out the side on 9 pitches because the definition requires it be 1 pitcher.",baseball
"The Washington has the Senators once from 1901 on. They bailed for Minnesota in 1961. They got a new team by the same name, an expansion team, almost immediately. They hit the road for Texas a decade later. The Orioles over the years tried to appeal to the DC market. You could watch the games, among other things, long before the Nats came along and the Orioles maintain a wider net of radio coverage than the Orioles.

The Orioles (who moved from St. Louis) were not the precipitating factor in the demise of either Senators team. It isn’t like baseball was a fixture on TV the way it was in 2005. But what was true was that by the early 1960s, the Orioles were cooking with grease and the Senators were not.

When Clark Griffith died, his nephew and adopted son (yeah) Calvin took over the team, sold the stadium to the city (to lease back) and a couple years later started talking to the Twin Cities. 

The replacement Senators also sucked, also had to deal with the ascendant Orioles nearby and was passed around on the ownership level like a hot potato. Bob Short had to make a bunch of shitty trades just to pay off the debt he went into to buy the team. He made the Jeter group look well-capitalized. Then he up and said, hey, somebody’s gotta buy this team from me for $12 million or I’m gonna move this motherfucker. (Three years later, the Yankees would sell for far less.) Short ended up taking an offer from Arlington, which had a stadium ready to go.

In the intervening years, TV did become more crucial, and teams’ access to eyeballs became a big asset. I think it’s best I end this tale here, lest I start a fight.",baseball
"My basic cable service offers FS1, ESPN, and TBS, however to get MLBN, the package essentially doubles the price from $80/month to $159/month.

Also brings up another point that it is complete bullshit if I want to add MLBN to my cable that I have to fill up on dozens of channels I don’t want and pay a massive price tag to get one channel. I wish they would pick values per channel and let each customer set their own preferences.",baseball
"It’s a licensing issue I think. They can’t legally stream TBS to you for example

But you do get access to the VODs a few hours after the game ends. One time my sleep schedule was super messed up and I missed an entire postseason game. Woke up the next morning and was able to avoid spoilers and easily watch the game",baseball
"It was same thing with us and braves.

Think of it like this. 

Imagine 100 cards are in a hat. 52 orange, 48 blue. 

It is more likely that you'll pick orange on every draw. But if i asked you in the span of 6 picks.... Is it more like you would draw 4 oranges or 3 blues. 3 blues would be the response",baseball
Dude has etched himself into Nationals lore forever (obviously). I still take Dusty Baker as my favorite Nats manager and tbh ever. He wasn't the greatest in the postseason but man the guy knew how to rally teams into contention. Really hope his son does well in college and in the pros.,baseball
"But he is a cocky player. There isn’t anything wrong with that tho. Most people love a lil cockiness from athletics. He apologize because it wasn’t a good look. It’s not like a normal bat flip, it’s more deliberate which looks bad. Bregman is aware enough to recognize it and apologize.",baseball
"&gt; I said nothing of stepping off the bag.

And I didn't say anything about the Holocaust, but you brought it up.  I'm giving an example, just like you did, but I'm giving a similar one (the runner is protected on the base and protected in the lane).  You went full Godwin.

&gt; Trea ran to the base within the base line

Right.  He ran in the base line, and not in the running lane.  

&gt; They are not saying anything about him being in the lane, they are saying he interfered with the first basemen.

The running lane is entirely there to protect the runner on interference calls.  If we're talking about interference with the first baseman on a play like this, then we're talking about the running lane.

I can't explain it better or clearer, so I give up.  Have a nice day, and go back and read the rules some.",baseball
"Deserved to not homer and lose extra bases lol. And my reasoning isnt that it's wrong to pimp a homer, it's that he didn't learn anything. he already lost bases earlier because he thought he had it in the bag when he didn't, stared a long time before he realized it wasn't going out, and then did the same thing again. Only this time, he actually got it. It would have been poetic justice if he didn't homer the second time either.",baseball
"I love old stadium but think about it like this, more income from the new stadium, more money to spend on players. 

I don't like a handful of things about the new stadium (fewer bleacher seats, more luxury boxes, lack of good NY eateries, empty seats behind home plate, etc.) But IMO, the fans make the place special, not the building. Was at the game tonight and our fans brought the energy 100%. 

Also, the old stadium was literally falling apart. They canceled games in '98 from beams collapsing onto seats.",baseball
Something that gets overlooked is having a firm grasp on our prospects value. Look through the trades since 2015 and you won't find many where we gave up a prospect that turned out better than what we got. Luhnow had gotten alot of shit for holding onto certain prospects and he's been right on most,baseball
"no, its more the fact that i fucking find used drug needles at the playgrounds my kids play at.  i get that they have some demon on their back; i don't really fucking care when i'm finding needles on the ground and i've got little kids that want to pick up everything.  fuck them.",baseball
"Metrics said he got a lot better this year, but he’s still nothing special. Give me a great defensive catcher any day who isn’t a great hitter over the opposite. They’ll probably be stuck with Sanchez for years to come. I don’t think he is any better than an average pitch caller at best either. Slider was the “smart” pitch  from Chapman to Altuve but Altuve knew that and was sitting on it. Sometimes the dumb pitch (fastball) is actually smarter and Ive seen sanchez call the obvious smart pitch too often throughout the year",baseball
"I think it was closer than people thought. Without Didi alone those games are closer. But game 2 was just one inning where the pitchers lost it, aside from that it was a 2-1 game for the Twins.

And this game was 3-1 headed to the 9th, with a lot of close plays to keep it that way, and an amazing Didi stop to keep the tying run from coming up. 

Game 1 was the least close, and even that was 3-3 after half the game.",baseball
"That's just some bad fucking luck man. It's like being the Padres, making the WS and running into the 98 Yankees. 

I'll say this, even though it pains me greatly. 16 straight over almost 2 decades is not as bad 4 straight vs boston in one series in 04. That was far worse. 

The Twins haven't even played bad series' vs the Yankees, 2009 for example, some close games, and a really shitty call by the umps and maybe that series is a bit different.",baseball
"Of course. The Yankees have had myriad injuries and issues and they've persevered despite it all. They could have easily ended up with the best overall record without those issues. That's not to say that other teams haven't had injury issues that have affected their overall season W/L either. If the Ray's had been healthy all year, I think 105+ wins would have been certainly within reason. I just think that is an overlooked aspect of the Ray's season when compared to the Yankees and Astros. People seem to assume that 107 wins always and assuredly trumps 96 wins without looking into the context.",baseball
"If the Yankees lose the ALCS or miraculously make the WS and lose, it’ll be the first decade since the 1980s where the Yankees don’t win a championship. And if they lose the ALCS then it’ll be the first decade since the 1910s where they don’t even win an AL pennant",baseball
"Damn, how could you not be happy for Strasburg? Weight of the franchise on his shoulders when he was drafted, getting injured with a Tommy John and everyone thought he would never live up to his potential.

Then he comes and kicks ass throughout this postseason and wins World Series MVP. Unbelievable, hats off to him.",baseball
"That's not how that works, but like I said enjoy it and don't get cocky...but I would love to see the Yankees v Nationals...but now we'll never know...I'll put money on one thing though, we'll see Astros or Yankees before we see the Nats in the WS next time...and the kicker is the Nats are in NL...",baseball
The problem with this is that the Redskins never have had a window to close. Perhaps when Kirk was around we could’ve had a run but we never had a viable defense. Realistically as a fair comparison to this logic the Redskins would have needed to be basically best record in the regular season and get blown out in the playoffs a couple years in a row or so and then finally after getting blue balled for years make a run as a 9-7 team and win the Super Bowl. Lol maybe in 20 more years will that actually happen.,baseball
"I don't actually think Betts is a particularly great fielder. 

His speed is making up for a ton of poor reads and he circles balls on routes all the time. Boston has amazing positioning tho and JBJ being out there really changes how you can do that. 

Honestly, I don't trust a single defensive metric for Boston outfielders. The entire outfield is a mess and a so different across the field that I don't see how you can judge it by the same standards as more cookie cutter fields.",baseball
"Absolutely.

Tanaka was a freak in game 1, and both bullpens pitched out of their minds in game 2. 

I imagine you'd probably be happy with a split in Houston going into this, and the way this game went on, I'm pretty damn happy with a split at this point.

Not that that takes the sting out of this one any more, walk-offs always suck, but we're all fortunate to be watching baseball being played at such a high level.

Best of 5, here we come!",baseball
"[He clearly wasn't though.](http://media.nj.com/mets_main/photo/11669215-large.jpg)

I fundamentally disagree that that play was ordinary effort. A ball that is hit right in between an infielder and an outfielder is hardly a ball that is ""catchable with ordinary effort"". It requires communication between both players to avoid collision as one player is going back and the other forward. If Kozma was stationary under the ball and it was obvious who was going to make the catch then it would be a different story.

More importantly, Holbrook should have realized that invoking the infield fly would violate the spirit of the rule and what it's purpose is. Kozma had no shot at even getting the out at 3rd, let alone the double play.",baseball
"Seems like most baseball fans are beyond just slow. It doesn't matter which team the runner plays for, that'd clearly runner interference even according to the replays. Turner was on the wrong side of the line all the way to first base. It's very clear within the rules. The one time that the umpires enforce a rule by the book, and people still flip their shit. Robo umps wouldn't make most of you any happier.

Had Turner ran from the foul side in, he would have probably beaten Gurriel to the base and avoided that call.",baseball
"I only played through high school (mostly first base), so take my explanation for what it’s worth. But once we hit AAU ball we were always taught to square up to the throw. Meaning for anything hit to the infield, straddle the bag with both feet before they throw, so you can move laterally or vertically more easily if a bad throw requires you to move off the base. 95% of the time you end up striding/stretching with your non-glove foot on the base (I.e. your right foot for a right handed thrower), which is what you were describing. 

For bunts and short ground balls that the pitcher or catcher get close to home plate, the same thought applies. Square up to them so they not only have a bigger target to throw to, but you also give yourself more ability to move laterally or vertically to catch the ball if the throw is off. In this instance, his left foot on the base was more or less appropriate to square up to the throw.

Edit: [Essentially what Don Mattingly describes at the 2:11 mark. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgXM8sk7P6c&amp;t=2m11s)",baseball
"Every year people talk about how important it is to get hot at the right time if you want to win a championship. People also talk about how you need a little luck to win a championship. The Astros had it in 2017, the Red Sox had it in 2018, and the Nats have it in 2019. I don't see the Astros winning this unfortunately.",baseball
"The catcher caught the strike and was ready to throw it around the bases and he didn't call it and said ""taking off on me"" as in don't assume i'm gonna call a strike.

Why say anything. It just shows you are hot headed and are letting emotions get ahead of you.",baseball
"If I got to choose any manager for the Dodgers, it would be Hinch. I love what Dave Roberts has done for us, but Hinch would probably put us on top. Also seems like a good guy. Him and Dave Roberts are good friends, and I've only heard great things when Roberts has talked about him.",baseball
"In MVP 2005 I did a fantasy MLB draft and then put Coskie on the Red Sox. He CRUSHED the league's pitching and then my team lost once to some team, making the perfectionist in me re-start the season and Coskie was terrible the following season. So I'm not sure how I feel about him.",baseball

"You extend Kershaw because he's been a top pitcher in the game, and the regular season still matters, and there are a lot worse guys to start in a postseason game. But why would you put him in as a reliever at the end of a game, where you know his postseason history, and where a fuck up means you don't get a lot of time to make it up? If he gives up back to back solo shots in inning 2 or 3, fine, you get 6-7 innings to make up the difference.

Also, the reason you put in a starter in relief is because your pen arms available suck. But he had Maeda and Jenson waiting in the wings. Nationals use Corbin and Scherzer in relief because their pen sucks. Dodgers actually have weapons.",baseball
The amount of people that think Snitker is some terrible manager now because we lost to a team that just flat out played better when it mattered. There’s very few managers in the league I would even consider swapping Snit out for. The players love him and the team has made great strides under him.,baseball
"It's irrelevant, i'm not arguing he hasn't been good in the playoffs. It just has nothing to do with being clutch and it's not repeatable.

His career postseason ERA is 3.26 outside of 2014, which is higher than his regular season ERA.

Why did Bum only decide to activate his clutch ability for one season?

It wasn't him being clutch, he just happened to be at his best in 2014 and played exceptionally well for a single month.",baseball
"Can't we say the same thing about Osuna? I'm not really a baseball fan, but through all of the records I dug up on him, the guy was never found guilty. Also, I saw some stuff at the end of ALCS Game 6 about Chapman being a violent partner, but he was also never arrested.

Where is all of determination of guiot and damning evidence, if any, coming from? It's literally all hearsay.",baseball
"Why? The announcing crew did fine tonight. I didn't even notice Joe Buck. I fucking hated Joe Buck early in his career, but he's gotten better over time by keeping his trap shut. Why would I need to listen to some homer announcer to enjoy the back and forth game tonight? The play spoke for itself, and I didn't feel like anyone on the announcing crew went overboard.",baseball
I mean it makes that round one upset look like not so much of an upset! At least we lost to the World Series champs. We Dodgers don’t actually like winning the World Series anyway we just like to dominate all year and fail when it matters the most. Stupid trophy. Congrats Nats fans enjoy it.,baseball
"It would consequently ruin your ability to sign other Free Agents. You are selling them on your team, your city, your Front Office. They decide to sign with you because of that. If you just up and sell them after that it's a slap in the face to them/Free Agency in general.

Not to mention the utter shitstorm it would cause with the fans.",baseball
"&gt; . I don’t recall CC ever doing anything like that.

It didn't end in a world series ring but that shouldn't downplay this accomplishment or the ""narrative impact"" of what he did in 2008. I'm not trying to make this a ""CC v. MadBum"" thing as much as simply highlight a now slightly underrated pennant race.",baseball
"I'm a woman, and I'm not your buddy.  He beat a woman while she was holding their three-year-old, so I'm still disgusted.

I didn't call you anything, so how did I generalize you?

"It's a very very good thing for the sport of baseball that the Nats did not lose this game. Like, that was one of the best games I've ever watched and I'll never argue otherwise. But if the Nats had lost the game and the series after that call, supposing Rendon never hit his home run... Anyone who's on the fence about their interest in the sport would jump off in the wrong direction. People who already are fans would have a rotten taste in their mouths all winter. It would have felt illegitimate.",baseball
"Ok tell me why I’m wrong:
My thoughts going into Game 7 for the Nats is to make our pitching the optimal setting. Normally one would claim to just ride Scherzer till he breaks. Problem is with the recent injury history we can’t guarantee he’ll be full ace. So what we do is open the game with someone like Corbin, have Scherzer do the middle to mix things up, and then hand the ball off to Doolittle and Hudson for the 8th and 9th. That way we maximize our bullpen usage and keep the defensive advantage. Thoughts?",baseball
"&gt; deliberately out of bounds

This is the part that needs to be removed.  In baseball, intent is rarely involved in calls.  Interference is interference whether they intended to or not.  Same for obstruction, etc.  For example, a catcher never intends to get hit in the glove by a swing (that shit hurts), but the batter still gets first base.

Also, part of the purpose of the special rule for 1st is because the batter is who puts the ball in a position where the throw may hit him (by batting it shallow).  The rule both protects him in giving him a space where he cannot be out due to interference, and still gives the fielding team a clear path to throw the ball in fair territory, even if the ball is put in a spot where the throw has to go near the line.  It's not perfect (it may add an extra partial step to a righty's running path, likely not even), but it's a good way to allow both teams a fair chance at a play regardless of what happens on the hit.",baseball
"He may have still knocked off the glove, and the ball may still have hit him in the back, but if he'd been a couple steps to the right he would have been safe because that's what the rule is. It's not interference if you're in the runner's lane, it is interference if you're not. That's the rule.",baseball
"honest question, is there a consensus that green book was a bad choice? I saw it and loved it. I just watched some clips a few weeks ago and have the urge to rewatch it. However, I cant say I saw the competitors other than black panther, and thought GB was much better.",baseball
"And I think it makes sense for them to bring this up because of how great a series Soto is having so far. They won't shut the fuck up about how young he is, and how it's historic for a young guy to be doing what Soto is doing, so it kinda makes sense to be like, ""hey, this old dude is clutch, too.""",baseball
"Now that I think about it the Rockies I would be good with winning also. I have nothing against them and their fans are really nice

I think part of it is that we are struggling to win a championship ourselves so it would make me a little sad to see other teams in our division do what we cant",baseball
"I remember perusing the Packers subreddit immediately after that loss and there was one thread and comment that stuck out. The title of the thread was something like ""What can we improve on for next year?"" The top voted response was ""Honestly? Nothing. This team was as close to perfect as we will see for the rest of Rodgers's career."" I remember thinking that I had to agree with that statement. That team was monstrous.",baseball
"California teams are currently 1/6 of the league and 1/3 make the playoffs. I don’t feel like mathing now but only missing out on 8/50 or 16% of the time seems about right.

Add that to 1/2 of the West is CA teams and 1/5 of the west teams are guaranteed to make it the odds are making me tired",baseball
"I’ve made the argument time and time again about who would you take in an elimination game and all the stat nerds would tell me the regular season sample size outweighs his small post season sample size but here we are again. 

I tried to explain that this is a mental game and those numbers on a paper do not take into account the mental strain of high leverage situations. 

There also is a “clutch” factor that does exist. Some people step up in big moments. Madison Bumgarner is one of those guys. He takes his game to another level. I think Kershaw had struggles against the Cardinals a long time ago and he has never recovered from it so it’s always in the back of his mind. It’s like a kicker kicking FGs. Once they miss and then they get the yips and can’t seem to recover",baseball
"You must not know Bregman. He literally thinks he's the greatest player on earth. He's not gonna sell himself short for any reason. He just knows this team is capable of winning consistently and that's what really matters to him. 

If it was about money, he could've easily done what Harper did.",baseball
"In the game thread, I asked why the hell those seats were empty...and I acknowledged that I am aware that they are insanely expensive seats even in a regular season game, and Yankee fans were defending their emptiness. Like c’mon, I get that it’s NYC, and every seat is always expensive, BUT IT’S THE ALCS!! FILL THOSE SEATS YANKEE FANS!!! If they’re even too expensive still, that’s on the organization for extreme overpricing then, so fuck all of them anyway.",baseball
"I totally forgot Wainwright pitched, on the 2006 Cardinals WS team. As I couldn't remember his first season, he pitched for the Cards. Interesting to think he's been on the Cards, for that long.

Also when I checked baseball-reference.com ( https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/wainwad01.shtml ), that Waino was only a relief pitcher on the 2005 and 2006 Cards team. And that he didn't become a starter, till 2007.",baseball
"So, I thought this was the case, but my friend told me there is actually quite a bit of leeway in what the ump decides to call. And that actually makes a lot of sense when people talk about umps calling tight zones and stuff. The important thing is that he calls the same for both teams.

So I've been told. Personally I think it'd make a lot more sense just to rely exclusively on computerized decisions.",baseball
"The only thing crappy about it is that it happens rarely enough that players don't see it enforced despite breaking the rule for decades.

So then when the rule all of a sudden needs to be enforced they are surprised by it.

In reality the umpires are always ready for this play. It's muscle memory to them. The players have never thought about it once so it catches them off guard.",baseball
"Honestly probably not. Interference is interference regardless of whether or not the runner is safe or not. And the fact that he was in between the ball and the glove seems like pretty damning evidence to me. The only way I see no call being made would be if he had established himself in the runners lane with both feet, then on his final step he left the runners lane to touch first. Because he never in the runners lane he is liable to be called out on interference.

One important thing to remember is in runners lane interference, intent is not taken into account. I also feel like if this play was clear that he was safe the throw would have been nowhere close enough for him to interfere with it.",baseball
"I've settled down a little bit from my headache-inducing irritation, and yeah, those actually are all completely valid reasons, along with the possible injury reason. TBF, I thought it was due to sabermetrics or whatever. IIRC, Hinch said he was saving Cole for the potential comeback, but as the Nationals hit the Astros further into the hole, the comeback was looking less and less likely. He should have brought Cole in to end it though.",baseball
"Close to 0

If you watched his post game presser.

He said his arm angle was dropping in his last inning due to fatigue.  By the time the game was over his arm was hanging and had nothing left.

When asked if he would pitch game 5, he answered no.  He has nothing left.  Whatever he had was all emptied in game 4.  If you bring him game 5, he’s gonna be very ineffective.",baseball
"I sit with a group of season tickets holders on the third base side. We yelled at Rendon that his season was over after we went up 3-0. He definitely looked our way after he and Soto homered and tied it up in the 8th...we had to look away, like the sad little men and women that we were.",baseball
"I remember that day like it was yesterday... I think one of the worst things to me is that my children are growing up in a world where they will never experience what was in comparison much greater freedom. Definitely a very different world than we grew up in.

I wasn't going to touch on the gun debate (I was purposefully avoiding it) but obviously that's one of the biggest divides between upstate and downstate NY. Simply put, a lot of us up here don't have cops on every street corner and surprisingly the crime rate up here is much higher. 

The main thing both parties have in common isn't what they wish to restrict, it's that they wish to restrict your rights in general... be it the right to bear arms, the right to free speech, the right to bodily autonomy and even the right to free travel. We just see a lot more of it here in NY and a lot of it is to seem as though the state government is at the front of the line for being ""progressive"". Unfortunately, the term ""progressive"" much like the term ""liberal"" has been greatly twisted and perverted over time. To be fair, so has ""conservative"".",baseball
"Part of me is hoping he didn't *really* mean what he said. That he normally posts that stuff in his echo chamber and strayed out into the wider internet with thinking. That he's coming to grasp the significance of those words and is reconsidering the attitude that begot them.

Much more likely he just thinks he's a victim of the PC police. The persecution complex is strong with Trumpers.",baseball
"Are we suprised? I mean this is the same fanbase who chanted Hurricane Harvey during the 2017 ALCS, jeering at Reddick about his wife and two twins that were just born, chanting houston sucks after they lost, throwing shit on the field, dumping beer on an As fan after WC. The list goes on. I guess karma is a bitch.",baseball
"My brother’s middle name is Austin because that was the closest city to Dallas my mom would allow. 

I’m from Boston. I don’t really follow other sports because baseball is 24/7 for me but if I were to pick other sport teams I’d go: Penguins just because of the animal, Suns because my aunt used to send me Suns stuff when I was a kid and Broncos because when I was a kid, the Patriots were not in OG Techmo Bowl and Elway was arguably the best QB in that game. 

It’s not which team, it’s consistency.",baseball
"Knights fan here, just to clarify, it was actually a 3 goal lead. Sharks down 3-0, scored 4 to go up 4-3, Vegas tied it 4-4 as regulation was ending but then lost in OT.

Honestly, I think most NHL fans will tell you that the play shouldn't have been called a major penalty which is reserved for egregious offenses with malicious intent, but the Knights also weren't able to overcome it in the way that championship teams do. The Blues had their own missed call go against them in their series with the Sharks, but they still managed to win the Stanley Cup. 

For reference, a 5-minute major power play is different from normal power plays because it doesn't end after you score, so you always get the full 5 minutes. It's a pretty significant advantage that I don't think can be overstated. The league actually changed a bunch of replay rules to allow more plays to be reviewed as a result of the large number of high profile missed calls in the playoffs last season.",baseball
"I'm sorry, I just don't see it. I know I'm probably biased, but I honestly don't see him calling strike first and then changing it to foul. His call is pretty much immediately after and there's no double motion or doubt when he brings up his arms to call foul. He does stick one arm out first, but I don't think it's to indicate strike, I think it's because his other arm is trying to take his mask off and once he does he puts it right up. I also don't know if you heard the audio, but they played it once during the broadcast and the ump said ""foul, foul, that's a foul"", it sounded like he was pretty certain.

As another piece of ""proof"", this ump doesn't call a swinging strike out with an outward pointing motion like the one in the ""foul tip"" call. [Here's](https://cuts.diamond.mlb.com/FORGE/2019/2019-10/13/c5330c75-d78687be-a532d33b-csvm-diamondx64-asset_1280x720_59_4000K.mp4) two [examples](https://cuts.diamond.mlb.com/FORGE/2019/2019-10/13/c85b1fc5-b22cabb1-b07b531c-csvm-diamondx64-asset_1280x720_59_4000K.mp4) from the same game of swinging strike outs, both times he does an unraised clenched fist and doesn't take his mask off. Obviously to make a complete comparison you'd have to look at how he calls dropped thirds, but [looking at other umps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68IPLrdAmkA) they aren't nearly in as much of a hurry to take their mask off even on plays when batters are running and the ball is much closer and I think the reason he does so so quickly is to indicate a foul. 

Maybe he got tricked up by Gary not running because if he didn't hit it why wouldn't he run with the ball so far away, but it goes both ways ofc, if Gary hears the early call then he doesn't run. It's kind of Occam's razor, if we're trying to explain why Gary didn't run, there's a lot less assumptions in thinking he didn't run because the ump called a quick foul rather than he didn't run because he turned around to argue an obvious non-tip and the umpire both believed his argument and changed his call in the middle of calling it. 

Anyway, this comment is getting too long. As one last point, even if we do assume he called strike and then changed it, there's almost no way to tell that Gary tried to lie to him or something. We don't see him talk to the ump, even if he was talking to him he could've just been asking what the call was (because he can't believe the ump called it a tip), the ump doesn't seem to acknowledge him, umpires should not let players influence their call in the first place, etc etc. I'm not sure where this really strong assumption arose that Gary lied to the ump, I blame Joe Buck because I really haven't seen anyone else give any sort of evidence to the point. Ultimately it's not impossible, and Gary certainly doesn't have a pristine reputation for this sort of stuff, but it just seems so unlikely that that's actually what happened.",baseball
"While I’m not as strongly opposed to these posts as you are, I do agree that these posts don’t account for the amount of variables that go into calling a pitch or the actual quality of these calls. You can’t just simplify it to “right” or “wrong” especially with how a lot of digitized zones seem to vary. I also do agree that these only get upvotes because of the gargantuan circlejerk this sub has for robo umps. 


However, I’m not trying to bash OP here. These posts are at least nifty to look at and it’s interesting to see what certain “missed” calls turned into. I don’t know how I feel about them, but I certainly don’t think they’re crap like you say",baseball
"Maybe because his placement didn’t matter at all to the throw or catch, in this case, until the last step before touching the bag, where he would have had to move anyway.

I think it’s possible that Yuli makes the play if Turner were slowed down by getting into the lane. However, I don’t think the rule was originally intended for that case, when it was a bad throw that made the difference. The rule does “reward a bad throw and a bad stretch,” even if it is only in effect because Turner didn’t go in the lane.

Nonetheless, the call follows the rule and precedent from similar plays.",baseball
"Inconsistent is probably a better word for it, you’re right on that. Infield fly is a little more black and white (except that one time, sorry Braves fans). 

I think people were probably rabidly calling it wrong, myself included, because we were so unfamiliar with the actual correct ruling - you know, inconsistency leaves us confused.",baseball
"Yeah man, the Astros were a stacked team. Great starters, great relievers all the way through. Really, the only thing that I think you can second guess Hinch on is pulling Greinke with only 76 pitches deep in a 1 hit game at the first sign of trouble. But even then it's not really a bad call because of the sheer depth he had in the bullpen, especially compared to the Nats. You can probably add leaving Osuna in for 35 pitches too as a more questionable call.

It just flat out didn't work out because for some reason the Nationals woke up in the 7th and refused to be beat.",baseball
Literally every time I saw Gerrit Cole stand up was like okay he's finally realized he's been an idiot. He's going to put Gerrit Cole in. And then freaking Pressley comes in?!?! That's honestly one of the worst ways I've ever seen a bullpen mismanaged like that's approaching Buck Showalter,baseball
"I think it's pretty intuitive. If air resistance slows down the ball the longer its in the air, you'd want to shoot the ball out of there faster. That means a lower angle.

Obviously there are other factors like winds and spin, but that's the biggest reason why the ideal angle is lower then 45 degrees.",baseball
"Yeahhhh I would be immediately cancelling my service. That’s bullshit. If you can, switch to Xfinity or equivalent cable provider. If you can’t do that, you should go with DirecTV. If that’s also not an option, you should just get live channels from Hulu or Sling. That’s what I would do.",baseball
"You, and the rest of Colorado, remember them, but there's a reason Larry Walker is not in the HoF, and it's not because he's not good enough or that his numbers aren't there. The only teams that don't win that are still remembered by everyone are ones that broke some kind of record, like Ichiro's Mariners.",baseball
"It would suck to not be one of the few guys to throw a perfect game, but if it’s any solace, every single person alive for it knows he went 27 up and 27 down. Even more importantly is that his game was one of, if not the, biggest reasons for the mlb to add replays. That is something that will have an impact on every single fan and player over the next generations.",baseball
"Duvall is awesome. At Redsfest a couple years ago he did some of the on stage events, like group interviews and such, and he seemed like such a goofy guy. He was pretty hilarious talking about how much he loved cooking. At one point he claimed he loved to ""cook"" sushi and when they asked what he meant he said in his thick country accent ""Ya fry it!"". He got a lot of laughs from the audience.",baseball
"It’s significant because you’re looking to throw a strike in the zone. It’s easier for many to just lob in a fastball just for the strike, especially since the hitter Is looking for that.

So, Cole painting that edge with a slider was risky. Since if he doesn’t locate that breaking Pitch  Is a ball",baseball
"I really can't see Alvarez being in the lineup in Washington. He'll definitely be available to PH, but he's barely hanging in as our DH now.

I love the guy and want to see him play the way he can, but I have more faith in Reddick and Tucker at bat right now and Reddick/Tucker/Marisnick are all way better on defense (although I don't remember much of Yordan playing out there).",baseball
"What's an article from months later have to do with it?  A ""media shitstorm"" doesn't exonerate someone for their actions.  You're supposed to judge people for their actions, that's how you see their character. Giving him a big applause the next time you saw him comes across as an endorsement, which I'm sure it was for plenty of people.  

Don't get mad about people fairly criticizing your fan base in a thread where you talk a bunch of shit about Yankee fans, it's throwing stones in glass house.",baseball
"Because it dumbs down the game, messes with the balance between the NL and AL (NL teams carry more relievers but this doesn't matter much in the postseason where hitting is at a premium and fewer pitchers are used), you should have to be able to field, you should have to bat if you're a pitcher that throws inside a lot, and tradition/statistical consistency.",baseball
"That’s because you’re looking for it, 99% of the comments on there have nothing to do with Harper. Also, memes are memes, there’s a huge difference between joking/memeing versus actual serious reporting that takes away from the team’s accomplishments. Pretty much all of us know one player can’t make a huge difference, but that’s not the point of trash talking and making fun of division rivals.",baseball
"Just to add to the great answer already posted, this was also on a 3-2 count.  This pitch was likely never intended to be in the strike zone, which makes it a badass pitch to throw when you know if he takes it you walk him.   He had confidence that the pitch would look like an upper-middle fastball out of hand, forcing him to swing, and that it would break (i.e. curve down) enough to make it near impossible to hit.  Great tactical move and great execution in a pressure moment.",baseball
The thing is the Dodgers have consistently avoided the solution for 7 years. They had proposals on the table for Hand and Yates. While tough asks might have pushed them over the edge the last couple of runs. These haven't been the normal 88 win teams barely making the playoffs. These are 100 win teams sustaining long periods of missing multiple stars. Six deep rotations with multiple all stars in the field. Riding their only competent relievers into the ground come playoff time. Kershaw is turning into a shell but they have Verdugo and Lux. What they don't have is a championship.,baseball
"Kinda depends on what recent means.

Since 2012? Then yes, you have 5, which is tied with a few other teams for 2nd place behind the Dodgers' 7.

Since the start of the 21st century? Then your 10 is a lot, but the Dodgers, Yankees, Cardinals, and Braves all have more appearances than that.",baseball
"Yeah I mean, it's not like I've been disappointed this decade as a Yankees fan. There is always hope. There is (almost) always the post-season. There are always exciting players, young and old. So what if we didn't win a WS? This team is fucking awesome, and I love cheering for them. WS is great, but it's not the be-all-end-all of baseball.",baseball
"You don't have to defend anyone. You again are misinterpreting my statement. 

I'm stating that one action doesn't make someone a life long racist or racist at their core. You however think that's the case and hence why I asked you if you believe that society should judge you only with the most morally reprehensible action you've done in your entire life. 

I usually need set patterns to judge if someone is an actual racist.",baseball
"As a Yankees fan, the fact that Chapman was the one to blow the series was the only bright spot in my severe depression about losing the ALCS and CC getting hurt. God, I ducking hate the piece of shit and hope he opts out and ducks off to another team.",baseball
"Dad's from Chicago, grew up during the home run race in 98 been a Cubs fan all my life. Dad is now really sick so I still rock the Cubs flair and wear Cubs stuff at ballparks

However, I've now lived in DC for 5 years, season ticket holder for 3 and have been to every Nats playoff home game this year. With the cubbies out of it after the implosion, there ain't a huge conflict of interest.",baseball
"Where he hasn’t apologized yet and the woman is in the room? They didn’t investigate? I haven’t seen anything else. 

Yeah that looks really fucking dumb. It’s clear they need to get their shit together. But that’s not going to happen instantly. If we all agree Astros culture is a mess then let’s see if they can change that. It won’t happen overnight.",baseball
"Oh it is embarrassing but not on a massive scale.  They just got exposed for playing in a extremely terrible division. Of course the bats look good playing Seattle, texas, and la. Put them against good pitching and can't score more than 2 runs. Honestly the better team won, Houston didn't stand a chance going against the nats top pitchers",baseball

Still hit .316 in the alds. Everyone on the team has had a streak of 1 for 20 something. Happens in the middle of the year noone notices. But with all eyes on them this postseason his struggles are being put on blast. Dude is due and is too good of a hitter for this to continue. He will crush some dongs this series,baseball
Putting him on leave and doing a little more investigating themselves would have been the way to go rather than that statement and every other reactionary step they've taken so far. Forcing them to cut Osuna doesn't really seem like the correct answer but fines and/or loss of draft picks like the NFL does seems appropriate to me. Sure a slap on the wrist but it's something,baseball
"""In baseball, a quality start is a statistic for a starting pitcher defined as a game in which the pitcher completes at least six innings and permits no more than three earned runs.""

""being about a combined 10 feet from giving up 4 homeruns is not doing his job""

Something about a long fly ball just being another out.

You're right though the offense has no culpability in the loss whatsoever, it's actually quite easy to pitch when your team is getting 2 hit...",baseball
"I'm a junkie in recovery too and there are a TON of awful takes in this thread from people who've never experienced addiction or dealing with a loved one who suffers the disease.

&gt;bUt mY pErSoNaL rEsPonSibIlItY

Wow, I guess the experts in here could tell us that the opiate epidemic is 100% the fault of millions of people who decided, out of nowhere, to get themselves addicted to opiates. definitely no underlying structural and cultural issues there.",baseball
"Yeah a career 2.44(?) pitcher jumping to 4.33 is definitely a playoff bug. He’s pitched I think 6.5% of his MLB innings in the playoffs, so it’s not going to be a great representation but that’s a huge jump. I made this comparison between him and JV today who have pitched 158 and 159.1 postseason innings respectively - 5.1% of JVs total innings. His postseason ERA’s about 3.05, which is what someone with his regular season numbers shouldn’t be shocked to see. 

Now; here’s where things get weird (and off topic, fair warning)

Other fun fact the best closers of today: Chapman stands out as one who’s likely built up his fair share of postseason innings. 32.1 IP, with a 2.23 ERA (these are the correct numbers). This lands him right next to some elite company: a man through 48 postseason innings, carries a 2.44 ERA (corrected from 2.48): Joe Kelly. 

Now take these numbers and stack them up against the best to ever do it: Mo’s 0.70 ERA through 141 postseason IP and then you think about his utterly absurd that is. I don’t think we were cursed for most of his career, you just didn’t get hit Mo.

Edit: double checked numbers",baseball
"Here’s why it’s ok to kick the guy out... it’s not about Greinke per se, but that family sitting near the heckler who might have a kid with social anxiety or depression.

"Let's see if I can get all their World Series appearances from memory, and in the order of OP's list, by year of franchise start.

Angels - 1 (vs Giants)  
Rangers - 2 (vs Giants and Cardinals)  
Astros - 3 (vs White Sox, Dodgers and Nationals)  
Mets - 5 (vs Orioles, A's, Red Sox, Yankees, Royals)  
Royals - 4 (vs Phillies, Cardinals, Giants, Mets)  
Expos/Nationals - 1 (vs Astros)  
Padres - 2 (vs Tigers and Yankees)  
Pilots/Brewers - 1 (vs Cardinals)  
Mariners - 0 (ouch)  
Blue Jays - 2 (vs Braves and Phillies)  
Rockies - 1 (vs Red Sox)  
Marlins - 2 (vs Indians and Yankees)  
Diamondbacks - 1 (vs Yankees)  
Rays - 1 (vs Phillies)

Among World Series matchup oddities, my favorite mindbender is that 1906 was the last time when two teams who'd never been to the World Series faced each other.  The first trolley series, the White ""Hitless Wonders"" Sox surprising everyone by beating the ""Tinker to Evers to Chance"" Cubs.  
For that to have happened this year, the Nationals and Mariners would have had to face off.  And now, with the current configuration of MLB, it cannot happen again, as only one team remains.  The streak continues...

From the NL and AL franchises in 1901, the last team to make it to the World Series was the Browns, in 1944.  So it took them 43 years to get there, and only during WWII when MLB talent was depleted.  Considering that the Mariners were founded in 1977... oh shit, if they don't make it next year they tie the record.",baseball
"Your guys were straight assholes for hitting Acuña and for that bullshit speech about the Braves starting stuff. You people and your shitty victim complex came out of nowhere after Carlos Martinez and Helsley ran their mouths. 

I’m glad you got your asses swept and I hope you never sniff the playoffs again. Best fanbase in baseball my ass. Eat shit.",baseball
"The Rays were the 3rd best team in baseball, behind Houston and LAD, according to 2nd-order and 3rd-order winning percentage. 

If the Rays pull this off, there will be a lot of “omg the Astros lost to a *wild card* team” or “wow the Rays didn’t even win 100 games!” chatter. 

The Rays are legit. The playoffs are a crapshoot. Anything can happen in a small sample.",baseball
"But it works, which is the problem. The whole system is set up for teams to pay a guy below market value in his prime/early prime before a “big market” team wildly overpays for their prime/late prime/the right to wring out whatever’s left of their declining talent, balancing it out.

The players need to really push for better in the CBA. There needs to be more “liquidity” in the player market. The owners are not going to pay guy blockbuster contracts out of the goodness of their own hearts results being equal — and frankly, neither would you in a similar situation. The incentives need to be realigned, and only the players can make that happen.",baseball
"All about that money bubba. They don’t give two shits about giving us the bare minimum. 

A. To have more time for ads 
B. To make the game seem ‘faster’

Baseball is no longer the most popular sport and they are trying to remedy that situation with bringing in more money.",baseball
"I'm not sure either. I also hate this ""time off will *kill* the nationals"" narrative. Yes, I know teams that sweep the CS are 1-8 in the WS. But, I think it's a fallacy. 

If the Nats lose to the Astros it will have more to do with the Astros being amazing than the Nats being stale. Even Scherzer struggling last night has more to do with the Astros being a grindy lineup. 

Anyway, I'll hang up and listen. Thanks for your time.",baseball
"I dug through the rulebook, and there isn't any specific rule which prohibits this behavior. In that sense, this act follows the Air Bud Rule: ""Ain't no rule says you *can't* do that.""

However, an umpire would have the authority to penalize or eject a player engaging in such activity.  Rule 8.01(d) provides, ""Each umpire has authority to disqualify any player, coach,manager or substitute for objecting to decisions or for unsports-manlike conduct or language, and to eject such disqualified
person from the playing field."" Also relevant is Rule 8.01(c): ""Each umpire has authority to rule on any point not specificallycovered in these rules.""",baseball
"Well we certainly haven't failed as a species if that's case then since we have too many people. That isnt even debatable. 

We could cut the children born worldwide in half and either stay the same population wise or still slightly grow. No one has ""failed"" as a species if they decide to not have kids. We arent in fucking survival mode as a species any more for fuck sakes.",baseball
"Absolutely is a mental thing. He's going to finish top 10 in Cy Young voting most likely; he's not washed now and certainly hasn't been in the past.

It also must be a compounding issue - the more he struggles in the playoffs, the more he is in his own head and continues to struggle. At this point, he must have no confidence in his ability to come through in the postseason, and that must make so much of a difference.",baseball
"&gt;Lower ticket/food/drink prices so the ballpark is filled up every day.

The ticket prices are fine. The concession prices are the costs that are ridiculous and driving people away. Reminds me of how people keep complaining about the price of movie tickets going up without mentioning the insane costs for every food item in the menu. Reduce the concession prices and you're going to see more people willing to go out to the ballparks again..",baseball
"Hey! We were cheering for you guys too. The only team we won't cheer for is the White Sox... unless they somehow are giving us a clinch... which is the last two times we made the playoffs. Also, after the way Indians fans treated our team all season, I'm not sure I can cheer for them again.",baseball
"I threw a 3/4's full beer on the field that night.  I chucked that son of a bitch from the 15th row into the infield.  Security guy saw me dead on, and looked at me and said ""Please don't do it again."" then he smirked and turned around, and then 20 other people did it.

Fuck this son of a bitch.  You can quote the MLB's response all day, but if any part of you thinks it was a proper call in that game, in that situation with what was on the line for the leagues first one game wild card playoff...fuck you too.",baseball
"It totally isn’t viable but at this point, if the strategy gets us closer to finally winning a DS, idgaf about the other rounds. I don’t know why he hasn’t used someone like Voth yet in this series though. I know he’s sort of supposed to be another starter, but you’d think he’d be a long man in this series too or something",baseball
"Man, I know Zim's with a different team but I really think Chipper inspired all the loyalty in the NL East, especially at the corners. Wright and Zimm (hell maybe even others I'm not thinking of) might not have stayed in one spot their whole careers if they didn't see Chipper do it and see how loved he was in the A",baseball
"Ha, came here to say this. I guess the difference is the Nats defender who made the throw actually threw the ball like a professional baseball player, and not a shit throw that led the 1B's gloves in the path of the base runner where interference was going to happen regardless.",baseball
"Definitely the Dodgers, the Yankees were at the tail end of an era at the beginning and now have one of the most successful rebuilds in history going on.  I have an unfortunate feeling that next year the tables will turn and the Yankees will be 1a and Astros 1b as they are younger and presumably healthier next year.  Where the Dodgers feels like they already missed a couple of their best opportunities to win and have wasted (or were foiled by) the best years of one of the greatest pitchers in history.",baseball
"Both teams played well, but we stranded too many men on base. We had a ton of luck in the first two, so a regression to the mean was coming. Just glad we still played solid baseball in the loss. Really hoping we can take game 4. Getting back to 2-2 would be really rough.

Thanks btw, I got to see the Orioles play once or twice before the Nats came to town growing up. Wish you guys could see some success as well!",baseball
"I don’t have a favorite to win the NL, but I’m really rooting for either the Twins or Rays to come through in the AL. Hopefully an appearance in the World Series will help the Rays as a franchise. It upsets me to see no one showing up to their games (during the regular season) even though they are having an amazing year.",baseball
"Yea, I'd just be cautious about a guy that has never hit righties for years, and then suddenly starts doing it for a month or two.  Which do you think is the real Nick?  I will say that Wrigley probably has better dimensions for the type of hitter he is than Comerica did though.",baseball
A friends young daughter quit there a few months ago. Her boss started reviewing her outfits attractiveness for the day and sent them to everyone in the department. They did nothing to punish the boss. She found another job and let him off the hook. I’m not sure I could do that today but when I just entered the work force I would have and did the same.,baseball
Didn't mean to step on your excitement! I just had a bad experience buying The Show 2017 from redbox so I didn't know Griffey Jr. was on the physical cover. Game wouldn't get past the loading screens so I think I was looking at Rizzo with the WS trophy for half the time,baseball
"One thing about this sub (and really sports subs in general) has a problem with, is the assumption that everyone is a fan of all of a city's sports.

When the Cubs do bad, you'll get ""at least you have the Bulls/Bears/Blackhawks"" if one of them is really good.

I'm don't follow hockey at all, and I make the smallest amount of effort to follow basketball, and am a fan of none of those teams anyways.

/End first world problem rant",baseball
"I'm a true purest. Remember the days when playing baseball and you could kick first base further down the line if no one was watching? Then when the other team called you out on it, they would bring the base back but they would try to overcompensate and bring first base much closer to home than it should be? It's a part of the game and it's up to the players to both keep an eye on the bases or adjust and run a litter faster should first base be 95 feet away. Obviously I don't want first base in right field but plus or minus 10 feet is the human element of the game. I don't understand the obsession of having the bases pinned down exactly 90ft apart.",baseball
"I think Minoso's HOF argument goes the other way: he had a relatively short career by HOF standards with an impressive peak. Ignoring the cup of coffee he had in the big leagues in 1949 and a few publicity stunt at-bats in 1976 and 1980, he played regularly from 1951 - 1964 and his career is more comparable to Hall of Very Good players like Don Mattingly and Luis Gonzalez than to long-career compilers.",baseball

"For what it's worth, the article actually references a different infield fly/situation: 

"" Seven years ago, Holbrook was the left field umpire at Turner Field when a popup by [Andrelton Simmons](https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31728/andrelton-simmons) in the eighth inning caused a commotion.

"Chapman looked a whole lot better than he did against the Twins (where he was looking wild and giving up hard contact, all for outs though), but even he got himself into a couple of tough counts last night. If Boone is going to lean on them for 5-7 IP every game they've got to figure something out to lower than pitch count.",baseball
"Everyone acts like the entire Yankees fan base is the same person.  Obviously there are “hurr durr 27 rings!!” fans but that doesn’t represent us all.  If another team had 27 wins they would also have fans who only use that as an argument and everyone would hate them too, it just comes with the territory. 

I just think it’s funny that this article reads like a fan fiction against the “27 rInGs” boogeyman",baseball
"Boxing is a terrible example to use with baseball. 

Baseball might be the least physically important sport of any major league.  You can be hilariously fat (Sabathia, Colon, Ortiz), short and athletic (Altuve), short and hardworking (Pedroia), basically an average fit dude (Yelich), an un-athletic muscle bound gym rat (Voit), or a pillar of human fitness, athleticism, and size(Judge.)

You can find players from that era who are were every bit as big and muscular as players today- with exceptions for the outliers like Stanton and Judge.",baseball
"NYC here. I know the World Series is a baseball event and therefore I can infer that the ""Washington Nationals"" is a baseball team. On behalf of the people who have not one but two famous baseball teams, I would like to congratulate the people of Washington DC on their first moment of baseball relevance.",baseball
"Oh yeah, from a team standpoint I can completely understand why the Nats didn't give him a big contract. I am 100% all for the argument that if they have limited resources, it made more sense to pay Corbin + other vets to improve the team along with the chance to re-sign Rendon. Strictly from a ""is my team better without Harper?"" argument, I think that one is ludicrous. The direct replacement is Adam Eaton, who in no way is better than Harper. 

&amp;nbsp;

But yeah, I wish everyone thought the way you did on this subject.",baseball
"I think back in the day he was just hung out to dry too late into games more often than not. Now I just don't think he's as good. Some pointed out he had a high home run rate this year, why leave him in against Soto in a one run game?",baseball
"This will probably get buried, but I knew Lunhow from his Cardinals days in St. Louis. While he’s a great baseball mind, he seems to have absolutely no empathy for others - that goes for personal and professional relationships. He just has no clue how to deal with situations like this and it’s clearly showing now.",baseball
"I know this is getting a lot of hate, but I think this is a fine hire.  Theo gets what he wants in the fact that Ross will likely do what the front office wants by listening to analytics.  Ross also knows how handle pitchers, which was a huge problem for us last season. 

I know he has no managing experience, but neither did Cora and that worked out just fine for the Red Sox in 2018. 

I think Theo Epstein knows baseball better than the users on r/baseball",baseball
"If the runner takes off, basically all of the infielders that notice it will start shouting that the runner's going, both to alert the pitcher that he can pick the runner off if he hasn't started his pitch yet, and so that the catcher and relevant fielders know to cover the play.",baseball
"Yeah, his last start of the season was weird because we jumped out to like a 10-run lead and the postseason was coming up. Natural tendency to ease up in that situation. His ERA went from 3.05 to 3.25. Otherwise he'd have a sub-3.10 ERA the past two years which is definitely borderline #1 guy numbers for many teams.",baseball
"Hey thanks for that! I’m gonna miss him a whole lot. There have been a lot of great Mariners since I was born, but him and Ichiro are the two who’ve been around for the entire time I’ve been a serious baseball fan. It’s gonna be weird not seeing him take the mound on opening day next year.

And I’m looking forward to it too! His last few years have turned him into a bit more of a fringe contender I think, but I’m still holding out hope that he’ll make it.",baseball
"People shit on Nats Park and us fans for not being a super hostile environment to play in, but I like that in general we act like human beings to other human beings because the games and season always have an end time. Maybe it's the scar tissue from the various psychological traumas of DC sports but I have a sense that most of us try to keep a larger perspective on things and dial back on hubris.",baseball
"I mean you could take 15 seconds to scroll through the thread and see that it’s pretty much unanimously agreed by fans of all teams that this was fucked up. The ump was calling bad calls for both teams, but significantly more bad calls went against the nats.

It’s also exhausting to see all the “BuT tHe HuMaN eLeMeNt” comments when it clearly messes up the game.",baseball
"Your anecdotal experience has merit. I can see many acting like that. I think the other side of the casual fan, is the one who is emotionally invested in what they're watching, but doesn't understand the subtleties. For example, those fans that would talk trash after a series win, because they're convinced that it proved one team is more talented.",baseball
"Not gonna lie, I really wish we didn't have to be the one to eliminate the Brewers. I really like them and they deserved better than last night. I would've cheered for them throughout the postseason if they beat us. I'm still absolutely thrilled and ready to take on LA",baseball
"Still doesn't make sense. (BTW, not a fan of either team.)

Turner touched the middle of the bag. How does it make sense that he needs to swerve into foul territory, then come back in to touch the base, instead of running in a strait line? If they are supposed to run out there, then the bag should be out side the line. Something needs changed.",baseball
"No but there are times where umps make clearly the wrong calls, on both judgment and non judgment plays, and there just needs to be a way to challenge or protest if you get robbed by a call especially in the World Series.

If you break it down,any play or call could be defined as a judgment call,it boggles me that there are still unreviewable plays in baseball",baseball
"It wasn't just racism, it was crime. Crime was soaring in the late 80s and early 90s, and people of all races were demanding something be done. Thus, black and white politicians both agreed tough on crime policies were the answer to the drug epidemic.

This timeline put together by an NPR affiliate fills the gaps.

We don't see a similar spike in crime today. In fact, crime has been on a long term downward trend.",baseball
"First of all, umpires have unions too.

Secondly, I’m so fucking sick of the cult of “get it right.” Instant replay has done nothing to make sports clearer. It only adds another layer of human judgment calls, and it serves to make games longer. We’re fortunate that baseball doesn’t overly rely on long reviews like the NFL or NBA.

Lastly, this idea of “machines make humans obsolete” has negative implications outside of just baseball. It would be nice for our pundits to stop telling us that their opinion on this and other issues is the correct one and we’re know nothing plebs for disagreeing.",baseball
"I split the data into about 80% training data and 20% test data to initially validate it, and I played around with different neural network configurations to try and increase accuracy. A linear model actually outperformed any configuration I tested, and it had about a 70% accuracy for the correct MVP, but almost every wrong case was the runner-up. The one consistent problem year was the 2017 NL MVP, where my models always had Charlie Blackmon winning, but other than that it performed well.",baseball
"Because this Asst GM is apparently really good at his job. That's the reason.

No it was a good experience and I was actually making a decent salary and like the minor leaguers I got housing and most of my meals taken care of at home and away games. The staff per diem was $40 for away games which I saved up. Let’s say 14 days on the road a month and you get $560. Off season I worked at a ski resort lol and then left for spring training late feb. It was a good bachelor life but missed out on a lot because I was away from home a lot. But saved like 80% of my money and invested and had enough to put a down payment on a house. Just couldn’t handle being on the road 8-9 months out of the year.,baseball
"I agree, but you're also managing for an entire series and not just one game. Boone went for the ""let's end this series early"" strategy, go for the throat early to end the series in 4-5 games. It makes sense to do that if you plan on relying on your bullpen, since the longer the series goes the more stress being put on those arms and the more looks the Astros get at the bullpen. The obvious downside is that if the series gets extended, you put yourself at a disadvantage.",baseball
"Games didn't always take this long. The norm used to be around 2 hours. The pace of game has slowed down significantly, and players do a lot of extra curriculars they didn't use to...adjusting batting gloves, tapping cleats 15 times, walking around the pitchers mound, etc. The nature of action has also significantly changed...pitchers used to try to get more outs on contact which resulted in shorter games because you didn't have every batter go to 3-2 counts.

EDIT: 2 hours was the norm in the 20's-40's, up to about 2.5 in the 50's-80's. Games started falling just shy of 3 hours in the 90's and broke 3 hours in the 2010's.",baseball
"God, will Smoltz please shut the hell up about overusing bullpens...It is such a boring take and doesn't even mean all that much. In a 6 or 7 game series, starting pitchers will often throw upwards of 200 pitches. A LOT more than any of the bullpen arms that have been used.

Smoltz is just awful, ugh",baseball
"lol I remember commenting on this last year - at that time it was starting pitchers for the next game being shown, tonight it was Yankee batters - but that graphic they do where they show the players standing against the info boxes, but they're moving, in this case holding bats, adjusting their stance a bit, every now and then one of them will point the bat toward the screen, etc.

It is the most ""character select screen in a videogame"" thing I have ever seen outside of an actual videogame.",baseball
"This series has been stressful and loads of fun. Looking forward to holding our collective breaths during this meetup of two of the league’s most ridiculous pitchers. Wish all of you all the best. *hugs*

"That's my thought process too. Not only that, but since so much of the regular season is between teams from the same league, wouldn't it technically make since for the ""better"" league to get home field advantage?

If they're not going to implement robot Umps to narrow the margin of error, allow the Managers to challenge a certain amount of ball/strike calls just like the coaches in the NFL get to challenge Pass Interference calls now. 

Last game and the strike call just a few batters ago are reasons why it's needed IMO.

I'm not sure if that's a popular opinion or controversial but I guess I'll find out soon.",baseball
As a degenerate gambler who took a dart on Hudson tonight in some of my lineups...holy shit how bad of a pitcher can you start on the brink of elimination? If they wanted to eat shit and lose badly they should have called me since I would have done it for 1/8 of the price.,baseball

good prospects in the later rounds are few and far between especially this soon. They also don't mean much since our FO gets great contributions from players who aren't considered good prospects. Having great prospects only matters if you're a fan of minor league baseball or they end up contributing in the Majors.,baseball

Random but does anyone have a link to that Astros .gif from 2017 where the ump pretends to take a foul ball away from a child but it's just a ruse and he gives it back to her? I've been searching for it on here but I can't find it. The funniest part of the .gif is the adult Astros fan in the background who seems to enjoy the joke more than the child.,baseball

"I mean, the Yankees have some of the most data-minded and industry-leading pitching development in all of baseball. Their farm system just churns out dudes with high, efficient spin throwing 97-100.

Rothschild and my team’s (the Red Sox) former pitching coach Dana Levangie are both talented guys. I think they may have just not seen quite where the industry is barreling towards, or maybe resisted some of the radical biometric data and exercises that have quickly transformed the game. 

I incorrectly believed Levangie was on board, but that was obviously not the case with his being reassigned and Dave Bush being promoted from his Minor League development role to Major League pitching coach.",baseball
I'd be lying if I thought the Cardinals would make the playoffs this year. Same for beating the Braves.  And I like either the Nationals or Dodgers to beat them in 5-6 game next round.  But I'll happily be wrong because that was an absolute domination &amp; they have proved me wrong before.  GO CARDS!!!!,baseball
wow lmao yeah im sure his manager has nothing bad to say about that play either lmao im allowed to think things about players even if im not a player. literally no manager ever would say that what he did was the right thing lmao doesnt matter if they are behind a desk or not. and to say it wasnt harmless lol. id be frustrated with your lineup too. but im not pissed at them. because you can only perform as well as you can. its also incredibly weird to hear from someone sitting behind a desk about me being racist despite them not knowing me. like thanks for your input i guess lol,baseball

If you are okay with that fact, then yes... it does give greater leverage to players.  I would personally rather have a cap with minimum spending requirements.  I find the idea that two teams in the same league could have a 200 million dollar disrepency in pay a bit absurd.",baseball
Huh? What the fuck are you talking about? Phillips never hit his shinguards. I just watched it again to make sure. That never happened. Talk about some revisionist history.

It's hard for me to respect the dude except for as an actual player.,baseball
Has it been exciting though? Game 1 &amp; 2 were good (Game 2 got away in the 7th) but Games 3 through 5 were the Astros getting up early and the Nationals just sucking on offense. So they're not close games and they're taking forever. Games are taking almost 4 hours. That's just terrible for anyone other than hardcore baseball fans,baseball
"For real though, it's been rocky being a Twins fan for the past... long while. But we had a really exciting team this year, with some young players in the minors I'd expect to see in the next few years that look really exciting, and while it was Twins/Indians battling in the ALC this year there's no reason to think this won't be a really contested division in a couple of years.",baseball

"&gt; It is more of a testament to the MLBPA than to the success of MLB, the NFLPA is atrocious.

The NFLPA is bad, but they're also generally handicapped by how many players are in the NFL and the massive unpaid labor force that is up and coming every single year. The MLBPA basically ignores the minor leagues entirely and the owners pay them horrific wages.

All of this would be solved if we democratized every single league instead of sending all of the profits to individual billionaires.",baseball
"Depends on how well they pitch but rarely do they go all nine. Usually 5-7 and then 2-3 relievers finish the last several innings. But today is a bullpen game for both teams which means all the starting pitchers have pitched recently enough in other games that they need to rest, or else they risk injury/poor performance. And usually a MLB team has 2-3 really solid starters that take turns going those first 5-7 innings. No pitcher could go 5-7 every game like quarterbacks do.",baseball
"Ill take that as a yes. Wasnt meant to be rude. To answer your original question no, you are not the only one to notice. Every one on that field notices including the umps.

"It's from the Giant Beastcast. Dan Ryckert is a huge Metal Gear Solid nerd. Two weeks ago he was talking about playing Death Stranding, and usually he is SUPER energetic about anything he finds fun or interesting, and he was just emotionless talking about it. So many things that he's played but can't talk about yet to nondisclosure agreements he'll sound very pent up with energy and seem to not want to wait to talk about it, but this time he kinda sounded disappointed in his tone. 

Then this past week when they were talking about what they've played over the week, he wasn't playing it at all. He seemed surprised that other staff were still playing it this week. The general consensus from Giant Bomb fans is either it is super short, Dan hated it, or both. Based on Dan's game preferences, he dislikes games that put more emphasis on narrative than gameplay, unless the narrative is ""cool dudes"" doing ""wacky cool guy shit"". He bounced off of Witcher 3, and hated Red Dead Redemption 2 (though RDR1 was his favorite RockStar game). 

So, it's probably still a safe bet of being a really good game if you like that sort of game, but it seems a lot of people aren't expecting really good, inventive gameplay with it.",baseball
youre right lmao. Its bad enough and almost expected when bullpens implode in the playoffs but when your MVP is pulling little league shit like that in a playoff game...lol Acuna coulda been the hero of the game but instead hes gonna be remembered for this.

Internally probably, but this is just a manager keeping his team fired up.",baseball
"I feel like 4-0 is the right amount of leverage to give him a shot - he's been really good since he came back up in September as a starter, which means he's likely a solid bullpen arm.

1c-a. The batter is not allowed to do a motion to the, uh, catcher, that prohibits the catcher from doing, you know, just trying to catch the ball. You can't do that.      

1c-b. Once the batter is in the swing, he can't be over here and say to the catcher, like, ""I'm gonna get ya! I'm gonna swing! You better watch your butt!"" and then just be like he didn't even do that.      

1c-b(1). Like, if you're about to swing and then don't swing, you have to still swing. You cannot not swing. Does that make any sense?      

1c-b(2). You gotta be, swinging motion of the bat, and then, until you just swing it.      

1c-b(3). Okay, well, you can have the bat up here, like this, but then there's the check swing you gotta think about.

Who now can't get anything going against the Nats for the 3rd game in a row.

Maybe the more disappointing team would be a consistent wc team that cant advance like Oakland.. so close each season..
But for a team who makes it to the alcs 4 times in 10 season's.. playoffs all but 2 seasons.. sure they didn't end how Id like , but then again no team is going to take 8 rings out of 10 ..

"Well, it's a business....for profit.  That's why the beer is $14.

They most likely don't want to pay the luxury tax, or at least a certain level of it.  The tax is not only money that does not go to helping your team, but can go to a team you compete with.  They are likely paying Bloom handsomely in order to save money where it hurts.

You also forget that fans (probably those like you) begged them to spend money forever.  Then they did.  they signed a guy like David Price, who is absolutely not worth the money they are paying him.  They got a guy like Bloom to (a) move Price; (b) replace Price; (c) make sure that replacement performs at least as well as Price has been, if not better; and (d) be paid significantly less than Price.

If payroll is the mark of your team's success, you deserve none.  I think he'll do great things for the Red Sox because likely they would like to stop paying that tax, but want to compete.  That also doesn't mean they will give him a budget like the Rays did (the Rays being the team that made the playoffs over the Red Sox with a much, much lower budget this year).",baseball

you continue the game under protest.

He definitely did not have both feet in or on the lane, and he collided with the first baseman. Whether that collision caused Yuli to drop the ball is possibly up for discussion, but, if the umpire believes that's the case, then this is a correct application of the rule.",baseball

"This gets mentioned in like every thread on this sub, but everyone views those teams with rose colored glasses because of how good their rotations were. In reality they weren't great teams. They topped out at 93 wins in their best year during that stretch and benefited from an incredibly weak AL Central that they still struggled to win every year.

I know it's not ancient for a pitcher but damn that's just crazy to me. I remember when he threw our no-hitter for us back in 2006. I wouldn't mind the Nats making the WS because of him. Too bad the return we got for him and Omar Infante ended up being a complete dumpster fire (Jacob Turner was the main piece, and he was a tire fire for us)",baseball
"The game went better than I hoped, and far better than I think anyone could have expected. A stellar performance by Sanchez ensured we only had to field Doolittle in relief. If Sanchez had to be taken out in the sixth, we would have had some trouble. Our bullpen is more than capable of blowing a 2-0 lead and I don’t think using a starter for relief in this game is viable if we actually want to win the series. At some point we’re going to have to start using the bullpen if we want to win the WS, but not today.

And, of course, I’m ecstatic our #4 starter had such a good day. I imagine spirits in the nationals dugouts are pretty high – if that’s the game we play with Sanchez on the mound, I’m looking forward to the games where the 3-time Cy Young winner or the NL leader in wins takes the mound.

"&gt; Pitch framing is just cheating. 

This is the same sport where sign stealing is an accepted part of the game. Teams do plenty of stuff within the rules of the game that could be considered cheating. 

&gt; Catchers will still need to be in a position to block wild with runners on base which is what allows runners to steal in the first place. 

There are a variety of things that allows runners to steal. Not having to focus on pitch framing will almost certainly mean catchers can use different stances that will be more beneficial to throwing out runners. 

&gt; Batters decide to swing long before the ball is at the plate.

Not sure what this has to do w it h what I said. 

&gt; Finesse pitchers will still exist and do fine, they just have to actually throw strikes or make the batter think they will.

That’s kinda my point. The more over the plate a 90mph fastball is the more likely it is to get hit. Being able to dot the corners is what allows them to be successful. 

&gt; I think there doesn't need to be a distinction between a narrow missed call and a large one.  Why do we need to reward the pitcher for missing or the catcher for tricking the umpire?

I don’t need baseball to be a perfect, precise science. Robo umps make the game less interesting because they make the game more rigid and sterile. Baseball is fun to me because of its logical failings. So much about the game makes no sense. It doesn’t have to be perfect for it to be fun. I mean, if you’re watching your team play and a pitcher gets out of bases loaded full count jam on called strike three that was probably out of the zone, are you thinking to yourself “man I really wish the umpire had made the correct call right there.” No, you’re probably thinking something like “oh man we got away with one there.”",baseball

But the Islanders first year without Tavares seemed encouraging for you guys right? No? And the Mets were the most compelling story in NY baseball this season. So shouldn’t you be happy about your sports kingdom?

"No,  world series umps are mostly based on seniority. There are some restrictions on working the same teams from the earlier rounds. So if you worked the wildcard with the nats, your ineligible to work them again the rest of the post season.

And the union complains if not enough guys get that bonus",baseball
He still interferes with his ability to catch that bad throw is what I was saying. It doesn’t matter if it’s a shit throw (which it should) you still have to be aware as the runner and give him the opportunity to catch it. It shouldn’t have been called but the ump wasn’t wrong for calling it. Everyone is getting to caught up on whether or not he was too far inside. That’s not the issue. The issue is he made contact with the glove.  To continue the NFL comparisons it’s like calling a PI on an underthrown pass where the WR has to come back for it and bumps into the DB. It’s not the DBs fault but the flag still gets thrown.,baseball
"The thing about the baseline is that the guy who broke up Galaragas no hitter was out of the baseline but they didn't call it. Obviously they fucked the call up at the base but them missing him not being in the baseline made that shit hurt even more.

"No, you are picking a rule that isn't in play here. It is a throw yes, but specifically to first base from behind the runner. The rule they applied is runner's lane interference which specifically applies here much more focus than the general interference rule. Also, just to counter your highlighted sentence in non rule jargon, you can't vacate a base before you actually obtain the base. They paint the runners lane for a reason.",baseball
"Yes, I understand this. I am still of the opinion that it is not a good rule, as Turner ran straight and did not really interfere with Gurriel, as interference would have happened regardless. This should be a judgment call similar to whether or not a runner is obstructing a fielder. In this case, it is clear and obvious that Turner could not have done anything to get out of the way of Gurriel while touching the base, so he should be safe.",baseball

So you'd have to estimate the distances involved and that introduces all sorts of subjectivity and error. You'd also have to know the exact point at which the third base coach started waving the runner around or holding them up, to know how much distance the runner had to cover, which isn't there in most clips. All in all it would be an even more time-consuming process. I'm mostly just interested in seeing when a third base coach makes a send, how often does that send result in an extra out reducing run expectancy.

Now, credit to Kelly he pitched well in his first inning of work but why leave him out there for more than 1 inning when you have multiple arms ready to go?

"My issue with the movie is that the dude was on fumes, a la Chapman in 2016 with the Cubs. He looked exhausted yesterday, and he pitched again today. You can only flirt with fire for so long. Taking Greinke out wasn't the worst move, but putting in an overused reliever in a big spot was.",baseball

"I disagree, if you get an egregious call in your favor you should expect a potential makeup call against you. You damn well know you didn’t hit the ball and you told the ump you did. Don’t be surprised when he calls a ball a couple inches off the plate a strike.

Seeing as there is actually a blatant issue with the sport that impacts it's integrity, it seems like a much needed change even if that means a couple of jobs get replaced.

"I don't think I'm the one reaching. You are saying it is likely that Altuve hits a sac fly. 

If you want to use stats like that, [he hits a fly ball 30% of the time and has a hard hit % of only 28%. His Med % is 54%.](https://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=5417&amp;position=2B) So that's a chance of 8 - 16% that he hits a fly ball hard enough to score a runner that's set up on third. And that’s under the 85% of the time that you mentioned he puts the ball in play. 

Still, I don't think we can use these stats because they aren't categorized by situation. 

Why do you think that it is likely that Altuve will hit a sac fly in that situation? 

I don't understand how my point is even arguable? Altuve could have IBB'd for all we know. He could have hit into a weird double play.",baseball

There were two check swings I can remember that they didn't bother showing a replay on in big situations, just accepted the 1b umps call.

Yordan has been hitting the hell out of the ball and getting kind of unlucky. He hit the double Altuve got thrown out on in Tampa and the liner to Judge Bregman got thrown out on yesterday. Today he looked like he was trying to force it but I think he's seeing the ball well,baseball

Edit: To plead my case that Sanchez didn't sell the foul tip, [here's pretty much the first frame of the call](https://i.imgur.com/XlxfRJk.jpg).

Yeah so your kind of agreeing with me? You got hurt the more you expected out of them. Losing a game 7 in the World Series hurts a hell of a lot more than missing a WC spot. Lakers were expected to make the playoffs last year. When it was pretty much out of reach I had like 2 months of the season left to realize it isn't our year. Losing a game 7 is one night. Your expectations are a high it is right in reach and it all comes tumbling down in three hours.,baseball
"Yeah. Acuña's fuck up was frustrating, especially since he did something similar in the regular season. But then, you realize just how un-juiced the balls are. It was the third game of the postseason this year overall and the first he was playing. He thought it was gone because it would have been gone a week before. You could say that he should have ran anyway, but I don't really blame him at this point.

Springer's was fucking gone in the regular season but here we are. Players should probably beware that the ball is different by now.",baseball

But between Gurriel, this story, and the [bizarre story that landed Chris Correa 4 years in jail and banned from the sport](https://www.si.com/mlb/2018/10/04/chris-correa-houston-astros-hacker-former-cardinals-scouting-director-exclusive-interview), several things about their management are a bit hard to swallow.

"Only at that point in the play he literally cannot be in the running lane. That’s the problem, that’s why this is such a controversial call. He was in the air going to first base, the running lane, does not go to first base. They are on opposite sides of the line. For him to be in the “running lane” according to your definition he could not also have stepped on the bag. Unless the idea is for the runner to always hit the outside or top  of the bag which is probably not correct since that can lead to all kinds of injuries. But assuming that the runner is entitled to step on the front of the bag, how would him being in the running lane earlier in the play have changed the outcome?

Look no further than [altuves base hit in the bottom half of the inning](https://i.imgur.com/ANw0TUB.jpg). He was inside the line as well. The only difference in the plays was that trae made a good throw that didn’t take Zimmerman in front of altuve and peacock made a bad throw that put yuli in front of trae. In that way, it is only the bad throw that causes yuli to drop the ball and trae to be punished. Now explain to me how the Astros should be rewarded for the bad throw?

And the people who are referring to it being called correctly in the rule book are misreading it in my view, and I admit it’s simply my view. 5.09, the rule that was used, essentially says that the runner has to be out of the running lane (for the sake of the argument let’s say he was) AND the umpire has to make a judgement call of *interference*. Interference is a fully separate part of the rule book, specifically 6.01. People aren’t necessarily contesting simply the out of the baseline one, although there is an argument to be made there. They are contesting that trae interfered for all the reasons I’ve listed above. How could he have interfered when he was going for the bag, yuli reaches into him, and he could not have known where the throw was going to take yuli or that it would be a bad throw at all when he left his feet leaving him powerless to change course. It’s two separate arguments, was he out of the line, and if so did he interfere. I don’t think either one happened, but certainly in my view he didn’t interfere and therefore this was the wrong call.",baseball
"#Catch Rules

1) You can't just be up there and just doin' an drop like that.

1a. A catch is when you

1b. Okay well listen. A catch is when you get in the

1c. Let me start over

1c-a. The receiver is not allowed to have the ball go to the, uh, ground, that prohibits the ball from doing, you know, just trying to be in possession. You can't do that.

1c-b. Once the ball is in the hands of the receiver, he can't be downfield and say to the corner , like, ""I'm gonna get ya! I'm gonna get in the way. You better watch your butt!"" and then just be like he didn't even do that.

1c-b(1). Like, if you're about to catch the ball and then don't yet catch it, you have to still step in bounds. You cannot not step. Does that make any sense?

1c-b(2). You gotta be, making a football play, and then, until you just are down by contact.

1c-b(2)-a. Okay, well, you can have your body up here, like this, but then there's the ball you gotta think about.

1c-b(2)-b. The Deadliest Catch is a pretty intense show.

"Q. How would Turner being in the running lane earlier in the play have changed the outcome?
A. As the rule is written, if Turner had been in the running lane, then moved out of the running lane to touch first base (as all runners have to do as you stated above) and Turner hits Gurriels glove, causing Gurriel to not catch the ball, Turner should be ruled safe. Because Turner was never at any point in the running lane, he’s liable to be held responsible for interfering with Gurriel catching the ball. 

From the umpires point of view, he has to think of 2 things - Is Turner in the running lane? If so, all good. If Turner is not in the running lane, does Turner cause Gurriel to drop the ball? That’s where it becomes a judgement call. In this case, I agree with the umpire that yes, Turner caused Gurriel to drop the ball. Therefore, Turner should be called out. 

Next, the comparison to the Altuve play is a great one. Runners lane interference only comes into play when, in the umpires judgement, the runner (who is out of the runners lane) INTERFERES with the first baseman catching the ball. There’s no “rewarding for bad throws” or anything like that. If the runner does not want to be held liable for interfering with the first baseball making a play on the throw, he has to be in the runners lane while running down to first. Him taking a final step out of the runners lane to hit first DOES NOT constitute runners lane interference.

He seemed to want Harris in high-leverage, Osuna for an inning or so, and Cole to close (or vice versa on Osuna and Cole). I definitely think he should've put Cole in, but that's not a terrible plan as of the info he had at the time he opted for Harris.",baseball

There’s a reason they only won 90 games despite having those guys and 3 fantastic hitters as well.

People say the tigers wasted them, but a pennant and a couple division titles wasn’t exactly the most egregious underperformance by any means.

People talk about those tigers teams like they were the 01 mariners lol, they wouldn’t have even made the playoffs many years.

"Nobody said Bonds is the only one that cheated - but his cheating was especially egregious. Highest WAR of his career at age 36 and continuing that through his age 39 season. Perhaps the greatest player of his generation taking steroids and making all other numbers look silly. We're all actually lucky Bonds did that - he forced the MLB into dealing with the issue. 

Are you impressed by Lance Armstrong winning all those Tour de Frances? 

Anyway, the problem is with how these conversations go.  The opening sentence from the OP: ""Say what you want about his steroid use, this stat is simply unbelievable...""  Yes, it's unbelievable.  Because you're comparing it to other seasons where people didn't do steroids or, if they did, didn't do them as egregiously. 

It's the comparison to other seasons that's rough. ""Out of over 17,000 offensive seasons in MLB history, back-to-back-to-back-to-back seasons in the top 10 historically is insane.""   The immediate answer is, ""Yes, because he cheated.""  When the greatest players in the sport cheat, they do insane things (Lance Armstrong with seven Tour de France titles).  ""Oh my god, insanely good players who cheat put up insanely good stats!""   There's nothing surprising about it. It's impressive, but it's only impressive because you're comparing it to other seasons full of people that didn't cheat. We all get the historical context, that cheaters always existed. It just reached this kind of peak between training regimen, availability of PEDs, the science/safety behind PEDs improving, and a disregard by those taking them of what others thought.  The HR-race pushed people into egregious abuse - roided out Sosa, McGwire, Bonds..  You don't see roid-monsters like that when you look at other eras of players. How much all of their bodies changed...they just didn't care that we knew. 

See, the thing is that these numbers need to be strongly connected. There's no way Bonds even comes close to those numbers without steroids and Bonds would have faded into our baseball memories by this point.",baseball

"Why do you keep acting like 2014 doesn’t exist? Why do we have to keep going back to this? Your sad attempt at manipulating statistics and gaslighting isn’t working. I’m not a little kid. Calculate what his ERA is outside one bad start in 2012 NLCS and tell me what his ERA is. Why can’t you do that? Maybe because it makes his postseason ERA way lower then his career ERA? That is literally doing the exact same thing as you are. 

Or we can take out 2014 and 2010 entirely and he’s basically Clayton Kershaw! You can’t just cherry pick statistics to fit a bullshit argument that nobody agrees on except yourself. ‘Well, if you do this and if you do that.’ And then you want to talk to me about facts lmao. 7 games in 1 season....yeah I’m pretty sure he gave up 1 run total over 3 World Series. But according to you he’s only been good in one postseason LOL. The facts are that even with his 2 bad starts in 2012, his lifetime postseason ERA is less than half of Kershaw’s. HALF. 

Clayton Kershaw sucks in the playoffs. Madison Bumgarner doesn’t. It’s really that simple. You can keep convincing yourself that’s not true, I don’t care. No one in their right mind would pick Kershaw over Bum to start game 7 in the World Series. Only the most deluded dodger fans would do that, and at this point there aren’t that many.

"A little, but not much.  A big reason the Nats got this far is they were having *fun* playing.  Even in stressful situations they had team chemistry and enjoying themselves.  Several bad calls bunched together can kill that feeling.

But to be honest, what kills that chemistry more than a bad call is when you score a run in the bottom of an inning and the other team counters that with a score in the top.

To anyone who knows the game of baseball should realize the Astros compared to the Nats have moderately better bats and a much better bullpen (though I’m still amazed they aren’t carrying a single lefty in the bunch).  The Nats main advantage is they are carrying an obviously better starting rotation in the top two spots.  Scherzer, even with his tendency to give up the early long ball and Strasburg are undeniably the best 1-2 punch from any post season teams.  Corbin by his own rights should be considered an elite pitcher, and Sanchez and Ross would be welcomed additions to most staffs.  But this is the playoffs where you milk your 1-3 guys as much as possible.  Corbin has been wonderful in relief, but had a bad WS start.

The bottom line is if Stras performs as has been this post season and gets the support he needs from his hitters, then it comes down to if Max’s back can “unlock” in time.  Verlander vs Scherzer is what everyone wanted to see.  I just hope it’s a healthy Scherzer, as it takes time for back issues to clear up.",baseball

The main reason of the failures is Roberts, a guy who hasn't been able to do jackshit with a championship roster for 4 years. We can have a championship roster how long you want, but that number multiplied 0 is still 0. Players will perform worse in the postseason and bats will go cold, it's the manager's job to work around that, putting on for example freese and Martin instead of leaving on 2 rookies way over their heads. And this is just one of the many failures of Roberts, without even diving in his criminal bullpen management. The guy simply can't handle the playoffs. 

This team will never win anything with him.",baseball
"That's all true. None of it matters to implementation of the rule. Again, I'm not saying it's a good rule. But I want less discretion in rules, not more. 

The rule is you are safe if you are coming from the running lane. They literally paint it on the field. Most of the time it's probably better for righties to ignore the rule and get to first as fast as possible. But if you do that and make contact with the baseman, you're going to get called out.",baseball
"As a childhood Mariners fan and adult Brewers fan, a STL-NYY Series is my nightmare. I think I just shoot Everclear until I hemorrhage.

EDIT: if the voices in my head could *please* STOP saying that Bob Uecker played for the Cardinals and Ichiro played for the Yankees, I'd be forever grateful.",baseball
"He can squeeze talent out of generally underperforming or untested teams quite well. He knows how to manage a bullpen pretty good too. The only downside is that he'll no longer be a commentator for YES and I really enjoyed his candor this past season, especially from a manager that had to face the Yankees only a year before (and had managed them prior to Torre).",baseball

"Not going to comment on your argument, but the methodology in the  [evidence for Walter Johnson having an 88mph fastball](https://theaceofspaeder.com/2019/01/24/walter-johnson-probably-threw-88-mph/) is garbage. It uses the world record mile times from 1919 and 2019, and assumes that because the mile time improved by approximately 10%, the fastball speed must have done so as well. Not only does this assume that mile speed and fastball speed scale perfectly equally over time, but it also does not take into account existing evidence on fastball speeds through time. Bob Feller recorded a 98.6 mph fastball in 1946, for instance, which completely ruins this concept on its own (unless Feller was a 4mph outlier, which seems like something that would be better reflected in the stats-in that 1946 season, he didn't even have the highest strikeout rate in the league).",baseball

"They'd respond by cutting two of the single a teams, for sure. There is no way some of those single a teams would make money if they paid guys that. No way they'd keep the same amount of guys at that increased price. If they make more money, there will be less of them.",baseball
"It's not just one...or two...or three ""strikes"" that Cole got that weren't actual strikes though, it's the constant balls outside that, not being controversial or anything and just literally what has happened, that the Astros pitchers have received strike calls on that were well outside the zone that have had a huge effect on the game.  I'm a Pirates fan, so I really don't care who wins and have zero bias here, but everyone in my house who has watched with me either stopped watching or is in agreement that the bad calls have been lopsided by a huge margin to favor the Astros,  not even close, so many ""strike"" 3s that never should've been for Nats hitters and so many innings extended and runs scored after what should've been strike 3s that were called balls for Nats pitchers and runs scored after the fact.  I get that bad calls are made, but this truly is the first time they've favored one team so heavily in my 45 years, and early, too, during the important innings, especially important when lineups are an issue with pitchers with such a back-to-back schedule.  Again, we've watched not caring at all who won, Cole is a former Pirate so we were rooting for him to do well, just do well fairly, not ""strikes"" 3 or 5 inches off the plate...on ""strike"" 3s...to end innings...with runners on... Thise bad calls screwed up ALL Nats hitters, they no longer can take balls because they might get called a strike.  Bad, BAD umpiring for all five games, but the way it's been lopsided...never seen it like this before.",baseball
"God this story breaks my heart. On one hand, this asst gm made me legit sick and if this is true (looks like it) he needs to be canned. There is no reason to do this. 

The other hand, the front office job is to win, and moral compasses be damned, if the league hasn’t suspended or banned the guy he’s technically fair play, I hate it, but other than it being a “PR nightmare” they have no obligation to care. It just sucks as a fan because you cheer for your team to win and Reddit calls you all assholes, but the fans didn’t trade for him, and the fans didn’t ask for him, idk I’m not making any sense rn but I’m kind of just torn on the whole thing",baseball

"Like the one he had for the Cubs was very simple but had so much more emotion. It was literally just ""The Cubs.... HAVE WON THE WORLD SERIES!!"". Also for football he had the famous Diggs call.

"Right? He's like the nicest guy when they interviewed him. Talked about feeling sorry not for himself, but for letting team down.

"During the nats/Dodgers series the replays kept starting and ending at the worst times. The most memorable example came when one of the ball kids off the foul line made a surprisingly good catch. The announcers did the whole ""let's see that again"" thing so they showed the replay... which started *after* the ball was in the kids glove. 

Every replay seemed to start jusg after the action and end just before the conclusion. I was convinced it was a joke.",baseball

"In an ""official"" Civil/Cival War II, you would presumably have different perspectives from different governments. If the Union continued to follow current law, it would consider it legal to shoot separatists in battle, subject to various DoD regulations. Civilians would still only be allowed to shoot separatists in self-defense (although I think technically Congress can also authorize private citizens to capture ships in the name of the republic).

The rival separatist government(s), meanwhile, would have its/their own definitions of when it's okay to shoot a unionist. You'd have to wait till the end of the war to find out which side's rules mattered going forward.",baseball

"Seems like MLB scheduled terribly. Why did they have 4 games yesterday when there were going to be a lot of people at work and missing at least 2 of the games?

They should have set it up so the 4 game marathon watching session would have been today. You know, the weekend where everyone has the time off to watch each game.",baseball
"I predict going into spring training 2020, the gap the Astros have over the Dodgers and Yankees will be gone.  I could see all three of these teams being equal to start the season in a 1a, 1b, 1c scenario.  

The Dodgers and Yankees are projecting to be better for 2020 than their 2019 versions.  Dodgers because they’ll have most money to spend on free agency since their 2012 season and their key young players are starting to hit their prime. Yankees because they are going to be healthier and I’m pretty sure they’ll sign a top free agent starting pitcher.  Astros will be probably be a little worse next year.  I think their offense will be great still, but their pitching won’t be as dominant",baseball
"This is true. I will say statcast data is more useful than the uzr numbers especially when it comes to outfielders.

"This.

According to Bbref, he threw 6 pitches, 5 of which were strikes. 

Of those six pitches, 1 was a meatball taken for a home run, one was a ""good pitch"" that was still *able to be taken for a home run* and one was a ball. Those add up to half the outing.

Also one meatball every 6 pitches is an absolutely atrocious clip.",baseball

"Is there a question about whether or not we can let the past go with a player with an ugly act of violence in the past? Sure, there's a question there.

But I personally see no reason why we can't keep smacking the Astros in the nads with a wiffle bat for going ""He's a domestic abuser that got off because the victim was 'convinced' to not testify? Sign me up, that sounds like we can get a fucking great deal on the bastard!"" as they continue to employ him.

"It’s because it keeps the game human.

No one wants a game where everything is determined by a UI ref.  Every time someone would do anything slightly wrong, punishment.

Hell, penalties would be called on little known rules too.

"I tried reading through all the replies to this comment, so sorry if I missed these questions.  

You're also flying a giant sail.  Rain tends to be accompanied by wind.  Would the helicopters be affected by this?  Would there be constant microcorrections at best?  Can a pilot keep this up for the entire rain delay?  Does fuel get spent faster?  Is there a maximum wind speed where this doesn't work, so you have to have the ground crew do their thing anyway? 

Also, you'd have to maintain a field nearby for take-off and landings unless you plan on flying this monstrosity in formation across town.  That sounds really safe...  

As you're flying across town and even if you aren't at maximum spread, are certain points below gonna get smashed by draining rainwater collecting in a particular fold and then pouring out like a downspout on a gutter?

And how does that affect air traffic at the local international airport?  And if you say that rain would delay the incoming passenger plane traffic, then is it safe for helicopters to be flying?",baseball

"Sure we’re allowed to talk about it, and he did lose them the game with that play, but this article dissects it to almost the level of a tutorial, explaining every bit of terminology involved. Hader got off the hook as “a culprit”. Not his inability to adjust to the lower zone/find any zone, not the absent command on that slow breaking ball that would always wind up over everyone’s head. With the the amount of steps they put into keeping the ball in front of you, they have no mechanical analysis on Hader, who was absolutely responsible for even creating that situation? And it’s not like he made all the necessary mistakes to get to the final one. Plus the Brewers lose that game on a single with no error had Grisham not gotten on base for Grandal’s home run.  

It just comes off as a case study into why Grisham doesn’t know how to play the most basic level of baseball. It absolves Hader of so much blame, glances over the questionable call, and a freak hit. Then it’s “remember Rendon? Yeah he’s still good BUT THIS KID IN THE OUTFIELD...” At practice, he could make that play with either hand, you could make that play, I could make that play, most people could make the play.  But if a 22 year old kid (or guy, idk he’s like a year younger than me), in his first MLB season, gets to a sudden-death playoff game, away from home, after facing two pitchers he’s probably watched for years,getting blamed in heavy detail for being THE guy along with “the other culprit” (who also happened to blow the game in Colorado that made the WC game necessary in the first place) who took the Brewer’s season from them is the article that immediately needed to be published, They must have been scraping for content. 

Like that’s the average fan’s introduction to Grisham, and possibly last exposure: and in-depth analysis on how he couldn’t make a tee-ball level play. So does he deserve blame?absolutely, but unless Yelich coming back somehow helps Grisham’s career as the Brewers RF, he’s nothing but a costly mistake in a lot of people’s minds. Like this isn’t Bill Buckner, “Castillo dropped the ball!”, or Jim Joyce’s blown call, enormous mistakes fallen into otherwise successful (or passable in Castillo’s case) careers, this is made out to be his entire career; his biggest “accomplishment” in baseball.",baseball

"By what standard do lefties get screwed more than righties? It’s subjective. 

And it’s not at all similar to tennis. There are no lines for a strike zone like in tennis where 99.9% of the time a good call can be made and we all agree. The strike zone sits there in space, is somewhat vaguely defined and has always relied on human judgement.

"Gotta say the second that Taubmann thing came out, I became a huge Nats fan. But more than just that, the fact that they lost Harper and went out and did this speaks volumes to their chemistry and work ethic.

I mean it depends if the starter is good enough to go long. Teams aren't just gonna push mediocre 4.00 plus ERA guys to 7 innings a night just because the Nats are doing it. The Nats are doing it because they have the pitchers that can do that. Not every team will have that.,baseball
"This would've been true for Kershaw if the Dodgers weren't very slowly developing him into a starter at the beginning of his career

"18 games is still pretty small.  A typical Tuesday in April has 15 games (possibly more with doubleheader makeups).  If data for Tuesday, April 9, for instance, showed lower home runs than expected, would you automatically conclude that MLB used unjuiced balls for that particular day? 

I would like the author of the study to post his data and R code (or whatever he does his analysis in) to a public site for peer review.  I'd be really surprised if this result were statistically significant after controlling for other factors (colder weather, better pitching, different parks, etc.).  I'm open to the idea that maybe this is all driven by the ball, but I think it's a whole lot more likely that the statistical analysis is flawed, or that the result is within a reasonable margin of error.",baseball

"I guess my hot take is that the interference call was correct, and it wasn't even that borderline.

&gt;A batter is out when... In running the last half of the distance from home base to first base, while the ball is being fielded to first base, he runs outside (to the right of ) the three-foot line, or inside (to the left of) the foul line, and in the umpire’s judgment in so doing interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first base, in which case the ball is dead; except that he may run outside (to the right of) the three-foot line or inside  (to  the  left  of)  the  foul  line  to  avoid  a  fielder attempting to field a batted ball

&gt;The lines marking the three-foot lane are a part of that lane and a batter-runner is required to have both feet within the three-foot lane or on the lines marking the lane.  The batter-runner is permitted to exit the three-foot lane by means of a step, stride, reach or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base for the sole purpose of touching first base.

It wasn't like he took one step out of the runner's lane and got called out on a technicality.  He didn't get a single foot in the lane he's required to run in.  He clearly interfered with the catch, so under the rules he's out.

Read that rule and then [watch his feet](https://streamable.com/hiss0).",baseball
"Nah, if the throw is awful, it's generally not considered interference. There's no ball to field due to the bad throw, so he wouldn't have actually interfered with the fielder. There is room in the rule to say that the only reason the throw was off was because they were trying to avoid the runner, but it's a hard sell unless. The throw is close and the runner actually causes an issue.

The sad part is that interference in general is a wide rule that allows a lot of judgement on what it means to interfere with the throw, but absent some contact or obviously getting in the way (such as when a batter steps back and causes the catcher to have to do something weird to make  a throw to third), it's generally not called.  The rules often come with umpiring manuals and case books that expand upon how they want the rules enforced, and they cover a lot of these edge cases.",baseball
"Every app is getting this way. They've all decided ""engagement"" is a meaningful metric and are doing whatever in order to increase that number, even if the ""engagement"" is I uninstall the app because my phone is going off non-stop with completely useless garbage notifications like this.

Modern web and app design is driven by a panoply of bullshit ""metrics"" that are being used to justify an approach to attention getting that most three year olds would be familiar with.",baseball
"I know we're all joking and having fun, but why? Kershaw didn't load the bases, didn't give up the grand slam, wasn't the manager making pitching changes, etc. Yes the two solo dingers didn't help, but it's a 2 run lead. It's supposed to be hard to keep that lead, which is why you're supposed to go to your best relievers when trying to hold such a lead instead of randomly using a starting pitcher in relief.",baseball
"A quick google search; 71% of all MBL players are American. 
18% is either Venezuelan or from the Dominican Republic, or from Rico.

"&gt;My only criticism is that he didn't use him for 2 innings and just did one. I get his logic is doing so. But, getting him in the game at all means you're already pushing his start back. Give him another 15 pitches and see what he can do with it.

I don't necessarily think that's the case. He might still start Friday as scheduled. Scherzer did this against the Dodgers. We will see.",baseball
"To put it into perspective, the M's organization still milks 1995 like almost every game. They have Blowers in the booth full time and they often have Dan Wilson in. Between the two they get asked about the mid 90s constantly. They run retrospectives and giveaways based on the mid 90s. 

In other words, our greatest moments in franchise history revolve around wasted talent in Griffey, Edgar, Buehner, Randy, and others. Which is the dark fact that undergirds all ""highlights"" of past M's glory: all that talent that got wasted or traded away. Ichiro, Felix, Boomstick, and almost countless more. 

We now have a crop of young talent that looks promising. Just hoping the timing is right that they get good right at the time the Astros start to decline. But that will probably be the moment the Rangers start owning us again.",baseball

"I don't get how asking for an honest conversation if we're going to talk about this is getting me downvoted. I'm 100% in favor of minor leaguers being paid a living wage. I'll copy paste my other (massively downvoted) comment:

Glad he acknowledges it. It just feels purposefully misleading when some of the obvious aspects of this system are left out to make a point. Minor leaguers should be paid a living wage, but many of them are never going to make the MLB. This is more likely the further down the draft order you go, and those guys are given less incentive to go through the minors in the first place. 

The first 66 players taken in this year's draft, if they all get exactly slot (some get over, some under, it all equals out as teams use their full pool) will be millionaires before ever playing a professional game. The first 168 will get $300k plus. The first 281 at least $150k.

Tyler Cyr was taken in the 10th round, 306 overall. That's not teams telling him with a lot of confidence that they think he'll eventually make the MLB. He still made that choice.

I think they should be paid a living wage, the MLB orgs are paying the salaries so it's really not more than a drop in the bucket on their bottom lines and has no effect on the viability of the minor league franchises that are affiliates on PDCs, but the players that are likely to make the MLB are making some awful, awful decisions if they're getting in financial trouble over even a 5-6 year path to the majors.",baseball

But oh god, that build up and stress like this game is unreal. And for it to end like it did is all worth it. I wish more people understood that.

The thing I remember most about the game is the dumbass Red Sox manager Grady Little leaving Pedro Martinez out to dry by keeping a clearly gassed Pedro out there for 123 pitches. Imagine if Dave Martinez in Game 4 of the NLCS had Scherzer pitch to five Dodgers hitters in the top of the 8th after his gas tank nearly went to E in the 7th inning. That's basically what Grady Little did to Pedro Martinez and he rightly got fired for that decision.,baseball

"&gt; Or football - the greatest team of this century has only won the Super Bowl 30% of the time since 2000.

I mean, this is insane when you consider there is 30 NFL teams and NFL is supposed to be ripped with parity with single game playoffs and the salary cap.

You can also say that the best team since 2000 have made the final game 45% of the time. Or the conference finals 65% of the time in the last 20 years. Or made the conference finals 100% of the time in the last 8 years. Or won their division 16* times out of the last 18 years (1 year they tied for the best record in a 3 way tie at 9-7 and the other year, their starting QB went out for the season early, went 11-5 and missed the division title by 1 game going 11-5 and missing the playoffs being one of the few teams in NFL History to miss the playoffs with an 11-5 record) (Oh yeah, that 11-5 record also tied for the division lead, but lost the tiebreaker to the Dolphins).

The 'quality throw' part of the rule doesn't mean it has to be a perfect throw to whichever side of the bag was available.

But even right now, it’s similar to the driverless cars question. If a computer can perform better than a human, but not be perfect, can we accept an error from a computer like we accept errors from people? 

I think what we should be asking is as soon as pitch tracking has a lower margin for error than human umps, we should switch. I’m perfectly happy with the occasional computer error if it makes fewer errors than a human would overall.",baseball

Sure, Verlander, Cole, and Greinke are filthy. Any one of them could take over a game. However, if you give the Rays even the smallest lead they can shut you down, and the Astros are probably not going to win a battle of the bullpens with them, considering they likely have the weakest bullpen out of the 4 remaining AL teams.

"I think it's more a reflection of 1) there is a natural difficulty in adjusting to the pressure of NY and 2) pitching is a very individualized skill, so even if the analytics say X pitch is the right pitch for a pitcher to throw, it's so much more about comfort level.  The analytics probably would've said that Mo should've mixed in some other breaking pitches now and then, but throwing 95% cutters worked for him and he was comfortable with it.  

I think one of the driving forces behind analytics is that good can become great and great can become greater.  We've seen this with our hitters.  Gleyber Torres was already a very good hitter, but he's become a great hitter.  We've seen it with Astros pitchers - Cole was very good, now he's great.  In that sense, it's always worth trying what the analytics suggest to see if a pitcher can get up to another level, but it's a pitching coach's job to recognize when that may not be working and to get a pitcher back to a level of comfort where they can still be as effective as possible.",baseball

"Honestly, I don't think it's that bad. You can exit the lane as you approach the bag (it doesn't even necessarily say it's gotta be the very last step), so it's not like you need a crazy lateral step.

If Turner had been running even most of the way in the lane, this call probably doesn't happen. But if you look, he's clearly *both* feet out the entire run, and he ends up blocking Yuli, allowing runners to advance. That's pretty hard not to call, no?",baseball
"“All the time” is a gross exaggeration. In the rare circumstances when it is called, it’s typically far more egregious than this instance, where Turner was essentially straddling the inside line while the fielder was throwing to first, and the fielder had a clear throwing lane. He ultimately touched the middle of the bag with his left foot. This is something that you may technically be able to hide behind the rule book on (though even that’s debatable) but practical experience would indicate it was a perfectly acceptable path to first base.

If someone had the time and wherewithal to put together a compilation of every time it’s been called in the big leagues this year, or in the past several years (bonus points for times it wasn’t called when a throw to first from a similar angle got away), I think it would be enlightening.

I hadn't heard anything about harassment (not to say that it couldn't have or didn't happen).

Really think things would be different had Mattingly pulled Kershaw after 6th in both games in 2014 nlds.

Until then he only had one true stinker in the playoffs but man he gave up like 9 runs in the 7th inning alone in game 1 and 4 of the nlds in 2014 and got only 2 outs",baseball
"&gt; Also the MLB clearly found that he did something

Not necissarily.   Blue Jays execs have said that Rogers had decided to part ways with him before the MLB investigation even began.   They made up their mind as soon as the accusation made the news.  They are a big media company who are hyper-sensitive to clicks while celebrity domestic violence stories are clickworthy news.

MLB found that the shitstorm which would have errupted from perceived innaction was more headaches than a 75 game suspension would have been.   Rogers wanted to the Jays to cut ties with Osuna right away but neither the Jays nor MLB wanted a union fight.

Remember that Osuna's case got a very fast media ban from the court.   Anyone who offers details of that street-corner domestic incident is either lying or breaking the law.

For all we know, they could have been tossing unicorn poo at each other until he threw his with too many sparkles.   

&gt; So I’d put the odds of Osuna being innocent near 0.

I dunno.   Innocent is a bigger word than ""not guilty of the accusations""",baseball

It’s actually somewhat redeemable. But their name is just absolutely atrocious and totally irredeemable. I also don’t like the Chiefs name very much, but I know Braves is in kind of the same vein so that’s a bit hypocritical of me, but their logo doesn’t bother me. The chop is bad all around. I think it’s bad at FSU, KC, and ATL. But I am aware that a large portion of the Seminole people are okay with FSU’s usage of it so I can’t really speak out against them. It’s their choice.

"Actual analysis: The Nationals 93-69 record is not representative of the talent level on the roster right now because that record was a function:

- of pitchers they don't need to rely on now (everyone other than Doolittle/Hudson in the pen, etc etc)

- injuries (Trea Turner missed a bunch of time with a busted thumb in April/May, Nats fans can probably chime in with other injuries)

- and I'm citing the bullpen again because it was honest to god the worst thing I've ever seen. 

In practice, them beating the good-but-not-elite Cardinals isn't shocking. That they're completely dominating is a bit surprising, but that's what elite pitching can do in October.",baseball
"It’s basically a stat indicating how many runs (saved) better or worse than average a fielder is. Saying “/150” is just extrapolating the defense over 150 games. It’s helpful for guys like Judge who didn’t play a full season. 

So if, for example, Judge had 5 UZR in 50 games, it would extrapolate out to 15 UZR over 150 games, which you can then compare against every other fielder using the same method. 

It takes the guessing out of a defensive comparison between two (or more) players who didn’t play the same number of innings.",baseball

"I guess. But if the home plate ump thinks it’s a swing, it’s a swing. If he’s so sure that he doesn’t feel the need to check at 3rd, he won’t. Maybe the ump just wants to make the call one way or the other and not let the other ump make it. I dunno.",baseball
"If players or the ball cross into the seating areas, spectators are allowed to interfere legally, even if the ball is still live.

"They weren’t that good this year, and it’s starting to show. They had a stretch near the end of the season, after they got swept out of Dodger Stadium, where they played mostly shit teams. Only like three good teams. And even then, they probably would have tanked if they Cubs had played their B team in the series at Wrigley the second-to-last weekend of the season. They almost blew Game 1 of the NLDS, which was a series Atlanta should have won in 3. Had they not massively choked.",baseball
"It's amazing how petty people are with umps THIS season lol. It's like every close strike is now the ball that would have won the world series, and we can't have human umps because OMG my team didn't win.

LOL, there are so many worse umps than this in the MLB. I am all for robot umps but they need to be set up right and tested properly, which they are currently doing in the minor leagues.

But let's not act like the Astros were not benefited hugely from everything.",baseball

"Yeah, Schwarber is a legitimate comp for Tsutsugo. I haven't seen him play 1B in the recent years at all. So he's more LF/DH. 

Schwarber had amazing contact skills in the minors that evaporated in the bigs, so that'll be the biggest question for Tsutsgo in the bigs. Will his bat-to-ball skills in NPB translate to MLB? Ohtani was special enough to adjust his swing to become a better hitter in the majors relative to the mechanics he showed in Japan. Tsutsugo isn't a reckless and/or flawed slugger like Tetsuto Yamada or Hotaka Yamakawa with his balanced, level swing, so I think he's got a good shot to survive the transition.",baseball

3) The road team is 6-0 in the World Series.

Road teams are 16-3 in the MLB, NHL, and NBA championship rounds in 2019. Fucking nuts.",baseball

"Unfortunately in the rulebook itself this part is absent. This is from the rules manual, which expands on interpretations to all of the rules in the physical rulebook, which can oftentimes be vague. A rules committee that Major League Baseball has is in charge of developing and changing these interpretations as necessary.

To quote below from the rulebook instead of the manual:
“(11) In running the last half of the distance from home base to first base, while the ball is being fielded to first base, he runs outside (to the right of ) the three-foot line, or inside (to the left of ) the foul line, and in the umpire’s judgment in so doing interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first base, in which case the ball is dead; except that he may run outside (to the right of ) the three-foot line or inside (to the left of ) the foul line to avoid a fielder attempting to field a batted ball;
 Rule 5.09(a)(11) Comment: The lines marking the three-foot lane are a part of that lane and a batter-runner is required to have both feet within the three-foot lane or on the lines mark- ing the lane. The batter-runner is permitted to exit the three- foot lane by means of a step, stride, reach or slide in the imme- diate vicinity of first base for the sole purpose of touching first base.”",baseball
I was watching this game in my 3 hour Business Law class and obviously have no affiliation with either team but was straight up angry watching that bullshit ass call on Turner. Can’t even *fathom* what that was like as a nats fan. And then watching the home plate ump arguing with the nats bench as they’re watching the replay.,baseball
"[Trea -technically- wasn't in the baseline](https://www.screencast.com/t/eXgsVww8g0) The baseline is the two white lines to the right of first base (no, the base isn't technically in the baseline, it's dumb, I know. But it's the rules.

It's just bad luck with timing and positioning. A little to the left and they don't touch, a little to the right and Yuli reaches in the baseline and it's not interference, a little earlier or later they avoid each other too. It's a freak play, I won't lie, but technically the correct call.",baseball
"I know this is a complete non-sequitur, but this reminds me of when Mickey Callaway said earlier this year that 80% of his decisions go against analytics or something like that. What he actually meant was probably closer to what you said, but he lives in a permanent state of foot planted firmly in mouth so of course he botched it.

To be more concise, I completely agree and think that being a slave to calculated decisions can seriously bite you sometimes. Just that you need to be able to explain that more eloquently than Mickey did.",baseball
That's definitely doable. It just seems like such a kick in the nuts to the team and fanbase that loses. Baseball is such a long season and to just have your hopes crushed in 9 innings or in an inning (Brewers vs Nationals) just doesn't seem very sporting or fair. Especially since baseball is so wonly when it comes to individual games.,baseball

* Astros win first World Series
* Eagles win first Super Bowl

"Hader is literally the poster boy for the relief fireman who pitches multiple innings. If he can't pitch multiple innings, who can? And it's not like he was in his second inning of work either. They lost with their best pitcher on the mound, that's about all you can ask for.",baseball

"Okay, I probably could have gone over this better to start with.  He needs 2 things to succeed: anger, and pressure. When he was warming up, Playoff Joe Kelly was right there, bombarding your poor bullpen catcher with 99 from 30 ft. away. But the vibes got too good. Someone’s double out that way caught him dancing; that’s when you sit him down. That, and a comfortable lead isn’t his pitching fuel. It’s “the team will be sold if I allow a baserunner” pressure combined with so much anger to make the physical pitch carry rage, that gets him at his best. 

Almost any other time, just a lack of standout good vibes and facial ticks will be more than enough

Edit: Idk why I’m bugging you guys I shoulda just told Roberts from the get-go. My bad everyone. I was craving some insane pitches tonight and when Joe got pulled I had to go throw them myself. Unfortunately Boston is Dark and cold so I couldn’t see and it hurt.",baseball
"When everyone is talking about the loyalty these players should have to their teams/employers to abandon their family and sacrifice their labour rights ... I wonder how much loyalty those same people would have if those same players made the slightest mistakes. 

Like ... Daniel Hudson is the worst (according to two DC media assholes) for not giving his entire loyalty to the Nationals. Yet if he throws a single fastball a few too many inches towards the middle of the plate, will any one of them be standing up to defend him?",baseball
"&gt;Hicks publicly said it was nothing.

Of course he's going to say that.  I wasn't there, so I can't say what happened, but what would Hicks have to gain by talking shit about his teammate and manager as a young player trying to find his place?  He has nothing to gain by starting more shit than has already been started.  Doesn't mean the bullying didn't happen.",baseball
"And that’s what it usually is.  Philly has the reputation of a “bad fan base” stick because with the majority of those incidents, you get some young, dumb 20something that doesn’t know how to handle their alcohol doing stupid shit because “they got a reputation to uphold”.  All while the majority of the fan base knows better and collectively facepalms over it.

I’m sure it’s the same in New York.  You get some young, dumb 20something who somehow scored tickets to be a bleacher creature for a day, can’t handle their alcohol, and say/do something utterly moronic.  All because they’re “upholding a reputation”.  All while the majority of the fan base will collectively facepalm.",baseball
"Raised an O’s fan. But loved watching the Braves rotation in the 90s because games were always on TBS. Maddox was my inspiration as a pitcher and I dare say, I developed a little dance in my two seamer from that. 

Have since adopted the Nats then 7 years later moved to Atlanta where my 1 year old will likely be raised a Braves fan because that stadium is awesome and his friends will be Braves fans. 

So that’s how I became a Braves and Nats fans.",baseball

I’ll never forget his little radio at low volume, and that first World Series win the year he retired.",baseball

"No, but it directly refutes the idea that “the twins are mediocre because they only won lots of games due to playing in a bad division”. The exact same thing could be said of the Yankees, they racked up a ton of wins against the bad teams in their division, and didn’t play nearly as well when the played other divisions, including the division being labeled as a “gimme”",baseball
"this is a totally different situation though.  first of all ti was obvious to pretty much everyone that the nats didn't want to keep bryce around.  we have Soto and Robles under control for the next 5-6 years and we have Eaton locked in for 3 more years at &lt; $9.5/yr.  the nats knew they could live without Bryce, and this year proved it.

Rendon on the other hand is probably the best player on our entire roster and we don't have *anyone* lined up who can fill his shoes at 3B.  whether it be via free agency or trade, we're not going to be able to replace him affordably.  we don't have anything valuable enough left to trade or we'd have had a better bullpen long ago.  without him or someone roughly equivalent at 3B, we'd be taking a huge step backwards.  i don't see Rizzo letting the Lerners let that happen.",baseball
"Even as a Cardinals fan who was openly rooting for Cleveland, watching that series was great. There was something truly special about the camaraderie displayed by the Cubs fans. I was extremely close to going to Chicago with my friend who is a Cubs fan just to experience it in person.",baseball
"Kinda like when a ball hits an ump unintentionally. The umps are just as much a structure of the game as the left field wall is so they are part of the play and play continues. Same thing here, Choo was just standing there, kinda like an umpire would be",baseball
I've seen this enforced when the catcher makes the play before. Like the runner gets hit in the back by the throw or doesn't give a lane to throw to first. But that ball was hit to the third base side. Don't think I've seen this rule enforced on a play like that before.,baseball
"We’ve won 3 playoff series’s in 39 years had 2 different 12+ year stretches of not making the playoffs since 83, we have less than 100 wins over our last 2 years traded away the best player we have had in 30 years, we have the worst contract in baseball, the team closest to us just made the World Series, and we’re looking dead face into an AL east that will grind us into dust for the next decade. We belong here trust me",baseball
"My dad would be one of these people that leave the game early, he has no self control with sports and just leaves when things get bad. Makes watching sports with him unbearable.

Just stay for another 20 minutes? What if a miracle happens and you miss a historic moment? Clowns.",baseball
"Closeout game, I can’t fault him putting in his ‘best pitcher’ in kershaw. Kelly too - with a lead the closer comes in, without it and with a 10-pitch Kelly as hot as he was I can see the thinking. You’ll need Jansen in 11 if you can’t score, joe seemed like he could handle 10. What I don’t get is why Kelly isn’t pulled in 10 in trouble early and why Maeda doesn’t get to stay",baseball
"Hold up there. This is still the Astros. If we win Friday, I would imagine we'll see Scherzer and Strassburg in the bullpen on Saturday for no holds barred going for the sweep.

This is still a HUGE if. We can't get cocky, but damn, can you imagine if it gets pulled off?",baseball
"Now I'm probably missing something here but can someone please actually explain this logic to me and not just downvote because it'
s against the grain?

So the Astros hire the guy (Osuna) who actually committed the domestic violence, yet they fire the guy who comments on the domestic violence?

I'm sorry but if that's the case it's just plane whack. I mean I don't care if he even said it to harass a certain individual. One can't possibly tell me that merely saying something out of line to someone is as bad as actually committing the act can they??

For the record I believe both are wrong. I'm not defending his comments. I'm just saying it's a little strange to forgive the person who actually committed domestic violence and let them stay but not forgive the one who commented on it.",baseball
"I don't see how the Yankees are slightly behind instead of exactly at their level, especially considering the Yankees current FO did it all themselves whereas Friedman inherited a chunk of what has produced on the field for the Dodgers the least 5 years. Cubs had the most wins in the league for 4 out of those 5 years mentioned (2015-2018). Boston had a three year stretch where they averaged 98 wins and got a WS",baseball
"You can't win either way. If he left Greinke in and he gave up the lead, he'd be getting roasted for leaving him in there. 

Personally I would've left Greinke in for another batter given how he was pitching, but the guy he went to shouldn't be questioned at all. Do people really want to see a guy out there who's never been in relief try to come in like that?",baseball
"Yeah but the Nats offered him what he deserved. What he was always gonna command in Free Agency was ""Savior of Baseball""/""Big City Superstar"" dollars.

He never earned the contract he signed. He was always up and down. His performances bumped between 1 MVP season, and ""is he injured"". Most years he's just a fringe All star slugger.

The only recent player deserving of a contract like that are Trout, prime Pujols/Miggy Cabrera, Kershaw, etc. Bryce fell short.",baseball
"I've been saying the same thing. Everyone's picturing Bryce moping around his mansion yelling at the TV, but I think he's sitting in a pentagram in a windowless room somewhere, calm, at peace, his eyes showing just the faintest hint of a red glow. The one thing the devil has bound him not to do? *Telling a living soul.*",baseball
"The mistake I'm talking about is Yuli doing the racist eye motion to Yu Darvish. Let's not pretend that Osuna is the only MLB player that has been charged. There are more than 10 playing right now. So, yeah, not my favorite thing, but he also wasnt convicted either. Additionally, it happened a few years ago too. It doesnt make all of Houston or our players or fans domestics abusers.",baseball
"I think given Cole and Verlander are ahead of him, it's probably more of a happy coincidence that Hinch has the best hitting pitcher of the generation lined up for G3. It would be interesting if for example the NL had home-field advantage or Greinke was the #2 SP in this series how it would play out.",baseball
"Ya just keep Judge and Bregman up there.  At the end of the inning the next three batters in the order gotta come up, but then bring up the big bats again if you can...and ya sure throw a pinch runner in there, whoever you want...spice up extra innings a bit",baseball
"Uhh, yes it does?

Do you realize where the lane is? It's entirely in foul territory. It's not the space between the grass and the baseline, it's the space between the baseline and that extra white line in foul ground.

If any part of him is in the grass, he's way outside it. You're allowed to be on the line, you're not allowed to be past it at all.

[This clearly shows Turner to the left of the lane past the 45 foot mark](https://imgur.com/a/wOa6jj0).",baseball
"So he needs to make sure that he lose a step to go 6” to a foot outside the line while trying to beat out a throw? He did not break the spirit of the rule, busted his fast ass out of the box and took a straight line to the bag while not intentionally impeding the play. Not his fault it was a dick of a throw and catch. 

And as far as “Torre doesn’t know the rules very well” I have no argument for that. He’s the fucking head of this shit so you can stop your defense right there. It’s a shame no one seems to know the rules on a routine ground out to first. He was safe and everyone with a brain in The world (including baseball players all tweeting at this point) knows it. Make the throw where it should be, ya know maybe not 5 feet down the line towards home?) and it’s a non issue and a matter of beating out the tag.",baseball
"It'd be one thing if it was an isolated incident, it's not. It's also unfair for your teammates and manager to have to answer post-game questions about you during the playoffs where the media is just looking to make a story out of anything. 

It's sad, because other than that he had a really great game.",baseball
"At the beginning of the post season I felt the Rays and Nats had the best chance to upset the Astros..

That being said, I liked the Ray's chances more, due to their competent bullpen.  I can't see the Nats not running into problems if they leave their staters in too long, or if the bullpen reverts to its normal self.  

But their offense is crazy good. I'd say 60-40 Astros sounds about right. 

And in baseball having the pressure on you makes being the underdog the more relaxed role. Probably closer to even when you factor that in.",baseball
"Yeah, I honestly did not like the vibe around this team. Like in '87 and '91 you could sense that they just had ""it"" and this year, as much as I love the Twins and as great their regular season was it seemed more like a weird creature than a monster. The front office deserves a lot of credit for putting together an unexpectedly good team, but they also should have done more to make sure we did not have an Uber driver pitching against the Yankees in the playoffs, when we were in July and it was pretty clear their was going to be a postseason.",baseball
"&gt; Kershaw obviously choked, but I honestly put more of the blame on Roberts. Why not just put Maeda, who's been good out of the bullpen, in to start the 8th

Kershaw got his man in Eaton then imploded as literally everyone but Roberts predicted. Watching Maeda mow them down afterwards melted my brain",baseball

But that doesn't mean much in a WS. Plus it could be Nationals/Rays (which if the Yankees don't make it, I hope it's Nationals/Rays) for their first WS at this point too. Everyone left could win and I wouldn't be surprised.

"To be perfectly honest, the 2004 Red Sox were a hell of a lot better than the 96 Orioles though, and definitely a lot closer to the 2004 Yankees (the surprise to me was more being up 3-0 than losing in game 7 even though I wasn't expecting that until it reached game 7). 

Not that it couldn't have happened. But I'm not as convinced.

"No matter what, we are praying our starters can go 6 innings in most games. Sanchez usually gets pulled after 5, but the others often can go 7.

Tanner Rainey pitched a quality 7th for us in game 5 and is trustworthy-ish. More than Rodney, Strickland, and Suero for sure. He has electric stuff and has been throwing strikes lately (which was the primary concern surrounding him for most of the season). 

Austin Voth spent a good chunk of the season as our fifth starter and put up good numbers. I could see him coming in for relief and getting some outs, and he can go 2 (or even more) innings if needed.

I’m also thinking Corbin may be available in game 1 for an inning if needed and potentially game 7 - but this is pure speculation.

Finally, I don’t think it’s unrealistic for Doolittle/Hudson to have a combined 3-inning close. This could backfire, though, if they become overworked.

It won’t be easy by any means, but we are blessed with great starting pitching. Definitely nerve-racking to think we can’t just have Scherzer/Strasburg come save the day anymore. Should be interesting.",baseball
"The four other teams in the NL West are such a crap shoot. They all have at least one star player that can have a crazy good season. They all have at least one or two decent prospects. I really feel like there is a ton of in between that is too unpredictable. 

Honestly, even this season we saw the Giants start bad, go on a crazy hot streak, and finish the season pretty average.

DBacks started hot, cooled off, got hot again, and finished poorly.

The Rockies had the biggest implosion in the MLB, but could easily have a 90 win season if everything goes right.

Padres have star players, young talent, but I really think they need to gel a bit more. I can see the Padres in the 2021 NLCS.",baseball
"4 runs. 2 in the first. They worked the pitch count up to like 1000 pitches. 5 innings from our starter. Forced Nats to use a starter in relief. 

This one is not on the Astros bats. Scherzer absolutely handles batters by getting to quick 0-2 counts. That didn't happen. We've won in the playoffs by getting a whole bunch of innings from our starter, that didn't happen.

"can someone tell me when they would’ve use Cole in this game??? you dont bring him out in the middle of an inning in a crucial situation when he’s never come out of the bullpen before, and the very next batter they were down, so they arent going to bring him in then. so why is everyone surprised they never used him???",baseball
"I would absolutely call it a successful rebuild even with the Yankees WS or bust mentality. My point is that the Yankees shouldn’t be an outlier - most of these owners like I said are billionaires but yet cry poor when it comes to investing in their teams, all the while not releasing their books. I can’t be certain, but I feel pretty confident about the fact that any given MLB team’s payroll could double in size and that specific team would still be turning a profit (when you factor in other revenue streams of course). Not 100% again, because these numbers aren’t released to the public. 

That’s actually a great idea regarding arbitration players. I would be fine with it. If only the MLB Players Union gave a damn about them.",baseball
"Teams sell playoff tickets for each series in advance of the postseason, usually if you buy season tickets for the next season. You get the tickets regardless of whether or not they make the game.

"The runner must run the last half between HP and 1B within the 3’ runners lane. He can leave the lane within the vicinity of the base in an attempt to step on the base. In this case, he ran in fair territory, outside of the base and because a catchable throw hit him, he is out and all runners return to their bases at the time of pitch. He is not protected on his last steps in this case because he didn’t run legally the whole way before being hit. If he was in the lane and then was hit by the throw where he did get hit, he’d likely be safe and no call would have been made.",baseball
"The saddest part too for me was that up until game 5 of that series, Kershaw was having the best postseason of his career. He pitched - uhh - decently in the NLDS. He shoved in NLCS games 1 and 5. His first WS start in Game 1 was one of his best pitching performances I’ve seen. Hell even game 7 of that WS he pitched 4 shutout innings out of the pen. If we won that game, that would’ve been his Bumgarner moment. That was gonna be the year he won a ring and changed his playoff narrative forever, and game 5 probably gets remembered more as just the crazy offensive game it was. But &lt;4 innings of Darvish later and here we are.",baseball

Obviously hindsight is 20-20. While I don’t really agree with the decision his reasoning honestly isn’t terrible. In a game 7 you don’t want to pull a guy too late and he just gave up a home run and a walk. If he kept him in there and he gave up runs then the narrative would be him leaving him in too long.

"We're going to offer Cole a high salary per year regardless of Correa or Springer.  The issue is we're not going to offer more than 5 years because our front office knows that long term deals are historically disastrous for the teams who sign them, even for a stud like Cole.  Some desperate team like the Angels are going to offer 7 years, maybe 8 and kill their franchise a few years towards the end of that contract.  To be honest, we will probably lose Correa and Springer for similar reasons the following year.  And yeah, that sucks, but it's smart baseball.  Teams win now by building your stars from within and extending before they become free agents.  We tried to extend both Correa and Springer but they want to be FA's (and I don't blame them, there are still a lot of teams with awful gm's giving superstars stupid long contracts that ultimately crush their franchises).

By building from within and extending while they are in their 20's, you now have the salary room to trade for superstars like Verlander or Grienke when they only have 2 years left and their teams are hot garbage.  So yes, we will try to sign Cole, and I imagine they salary per year will be very competitive, but there are still some stupid and desperate GM's that have not evolved to the current understanding of how to build a consistent contender.  Luhnow wants to be a world series contender every year.

And again, Correa (or Springer, who is historically as injury prone) don't really factor into the decision to not offer Cole 7+ years, a well run and incredibly analytical front office is why that won't happen.",baseball

The top stat line is 2019 Money Machado, $30,000,000 per year. The bottom stat line? 2019 Kyle Schwarber, who made just over one-tenth of that amount on his last pre-arbitration contract. 

Machado was worth 3.1 bWAR, Schwarber 2.3. When you take into account the WAR positional adjustment (which is negative for left field and very positive for 3rd base/shortstop), the difference is basically negligible and probably even favors Schwarbs.

"Baseball is played with 9 fielders.  It is also possible (frequent even) in an NL game, to use more than 9, some of whom may never play the field. 

Should we require every pinch hitter to play at least 1 out or one inning in the field? You know, just cause fielding is so vital to the integrity of the game.

Should we require every pitcher to stay in the game until he has batted at least once? For the integrity of the game, of course they should have to bat.

The NL already has a form of the DH, it just comes with a much higher penalty (player being subbed for is lost) and we call it something different. But let’s face it, once the starting pitcher is done, the NL has a progression of designated hitters from the 5th to 6th inning on.

Letting a RPer bat is very rare unless the game is well in hand and there’s no need to play for an extra run.

What there is, is the strategy of when to pull that pitcher and his future value vs the value of a better hitter. That’s real and interesting, but let’s not pretend that pitchers hit much after the 5th inning and often not after the 3rd.

A great pitcher such as likely Cy Young winner Jacob deGrom had 204 IP in 2019 over 32 GS for an average of 6.375 IP/GS.

He had 70 PA over those 32 GS and 204 IP.

That means he averaged a little over 2 PA per GS. And this is one of the best SPers in the NL. Lesser pitchers would bat even fewer times.

So let’s not talk as if NL pitchers are racking up 4,  5, or 6 PA per game or that they don’t have batters hitting for them. Yes, there’s strategy as to when they do it, but it’s effectively a 60% DH at a minimum.",baseball
"I’d agree, and I’d prefer to see you guys get Cole over NY. Between Maddon, Cole, and perhaps another smaller addition, you’d be in very good shape next year.

"I take team success with a grain of salt. Baseball is not like basketball, where an individual could have a huge influence on an outcome every single night. 

I do think a 41 HR 112 RBI player played an important factor in his teams success when considering the amount of games Correa, Altuve and Springer all missed. Christian Yelich is the counter argument. That may have been a fluke occurrence, but it happened. Somehow the Brewers played better without him. 

With that being said, I do think team success should have some influence on the MVP outcome, but a player shouldn’t necessarily be punished because he played on a 90 loss team either. 

It would be different if Trout was leaps and bounds ahead of everyone else while playing on a losing team. This isn’t one of those cases. Bregman had a huge year. 

I do agree that if Trout or Bregman won, I wouldn’t see it as a mistake.",baseball
"I'm not saying I don't like WAR. I do tend to think it's more accurate for hitters - look at any individual stat and Lynn is well behind the other four. For example he has a 1.22 WHIP on the year. The highest of the other four is Scherzer's 1.03, with the others all below one. You see the same discrepancy across the board. WAR for pitchers isn't useless, but the other four do seem to be a tier above everyone right now, and he has about the same WAR as them. 

As for Utley/Howard, even at the time many realized Howard was the better power hitter but Utley was better everywhere else. I do think think the difference between them is a little less than WAR would indicate, sure, but WAR for position players, or at least the offensive portion, is pretty airtight compared to pitching WAR.",baseball
"So instead leave pitchers in to give up 10 ER and throw out their arms? How does that make sense?

I don’t think baseball is fading away. And if it were, it’s not because the games are too long. It’s because there are 162 games a year and very few young people have 3+ hours every single night dedicate to it. There is too much other “stuff” to do.",baseball

So for example, if they competitive balance money is $75m (random number picked) then you only get that full $75m if your payroll for the year is $100m, if you only spend $50m on payroll then you only get $37.5m from the competitive balance money.

"You know how a run can score even if someone is doubled off for not tagging up for the third out of the inning on the same play because doubling off someone is an appeal play, not a force?

If Merkle had simply missed second and touched third, would his being out at second no longer be a force and be an appeal instead, causing runs to count?",baseball
"yeah i mean, they can just tweak the zone if that became an issue. i seriously just dislike the idea of a perfect strike zone bc i like having something to talk about. i think it adds a bit of character to the game.

plus, like, once you've watched baseball for a while, i think it's healthy to naturally start to lose the intensity that some fans have. like, it's one pitch...chill out. if it was with two strikes, you shoulda protected better...too close to take.

I'd get rid of replay altogether.",baseball
"If you are going to start calling that a strike then hitters are going to have to start standing further forward in the box, as you just cannot hit that if you aren't standing level with the front of home plate. If hitters have to start standing closer, the pitchers will get a huge advantage, you'd probably have to end up moving the mound back 6 inches to counter hitters having to stand 6 inches closer.

My major bug bear with technology is that it takes us further and further away from the spirit of the rules and more into ridiculous lawyering technicalities. (nowhere is this more apparent than the stupid replays to call people out for bouncing a millimetre off second base when clearly stealing a base safely by about 3 feet) The ball/strike rules were never brought in so you could throw the ball to unhittable spots for called strikes, they were to encourage hitters to swing at hittable pitches and to discourage pitchers from throwing nothing but junk. It feels like peoples constant complaining about decisions is leading all sports into very strange, unintended directions all in the name of things being ""technically right""",baseball

"I wouldn't be so quick to blame ticket prices.  Baseball tickets are super cheap on the secondary market, even for premier teams like the Yankees.  It's easy to get tickets for $6 on StubHub throughout the regular season.  Food and beer inside the stadium is super expensive (can get around that by just eating beforehand), but tickets alone are really cheap. Parking can be expensive, but for the teams I usually watch, the train gets me there cheap.

That said, the secondhand market means fewer people buying from the team themselves.  That's a pretty recent development, and I bet it has a real impact on attendance figures.",baseball
"Biggest spot of last night's game was Profar's first-inning appearance with the bases loaded and two out, and since this is apparently my thing now, let's break out [the calculator.](https://gregstoll.com/~gregstoll/baseball/stats.html#V.0.1.0.1.0.0) It's not perfectly accurate, but it's generally good enough. (and also I'm going to stick to realistic options and not, like, a three-run wild pitch)

At start of PA: Tampa 53% win expectancy (all numbers rounded for simplicity)

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED: Profar flyout, Tampa 60% 

Wild pitch, second and third, 1-1 score: Tampa 40%

If Profar reaches base via walk, HBP, or anything that just advances everyone one base and still leaves the bases loaded: Tampa 38%

Two-run single, first and second, 2-1 score: Tampa 32%

Two-run single, first and third: Tampa 30%

Two-run double, second and third: Tampa 30% (I'm a bit surprised the odds are virtually identical here)

Three-run double, 3-1 score: Tampa 26%

Three run triple, 3-1 score: Tampa 25%

Grand slam, 4-1 score: Tampa 17%

"I don't think it's as different as they implied, but standing on the mound waiting around for 15 minutes and then resuming an inning is different than waiting for a long inning in the dugout.

The weirdly stretched wide M and the tall B, the green bats over a blue diamond, the fact that the layers don't make any sense (are the bats in front of or behind the blue?). It's like they were trying out way too many things at once. I'm told it's supposed to look like an industrial stamp, except it looks nothing like one because industrial stamps are generally one color. I assume the gold is supposed to be reminiscent of the piping found in a brewery, but it looks awful outlined in green, which wasn't even a Brewers color until that logo was introduced.

"In the WS, HFA is determined solely by record. And why wouldn't it be? Once you get to the WS, each team's ranking in the standings (division leader or wildcard) doesn't matter anymore; they earned their way into the WS, to play head-to-head, and the only fair way to determine HFA at that point is to go by their records.

If a WC team makes it to the WS and has a better record than their opponent, they get HFA. Doesn't matter that they were ""only"" a WC team.

(Why MLB ever used any other method to determine HFA, such as the AS game or alternating years, is beyond me.)",baseball

I'm not saying it isn't gatekeeping, but some of the answers are a mix of disappointing and hilarious. More than a few people have responded with Bryce Harper and he's gotten just about every answer under the sun for a double switch. No a double switch is not the batter being a switch hitter, everyone in the infield playing on the right side in an extreme shift, or my personal favorite - moving two (position player) batters around in the order midgame in order to maximize ""damage"".",baseball

Hi, fellow Astros fan here - you're the salty one.

It doesn't cheapen the Astros' victory that Glasnow tipped his pitches. It would have been a different game if he hadn't been. It's normal and fine for people to wonder what would've happened if something was changed.

And finally, the world does not revolve around the Astros. People can wonder about different outcomes without it being a slight.",baseball

Why not cut out the middle man and do it now? Forego a windup and just go out of the stretch the whole time.",baseball

lol what? It's not like they gave up two top 5 prospects in the league for him... Their farm was pretty depleted by the time they made that trade, and Seth Beer (96th) was the only top 100 prospect they gave up. As for his speed, Greinke has never relied on blowing hitters out of the water, so he should age well (as evident by his stats..)

"Baby Shark all the way.

I do not fall in the camp of the chop being *racist*. (I feel strongly that word is being massively misused, which IMO reduces the impact of things that are actually truly *racist*.) 

It is, however, a gross misrepresentation of Native American history and culture, and the team should stop officially supporting it, playing the chop music, etc. (How the team gets a stadium full of people to not do something is a whole other matter!)

The Baby Shark thing is just fun... I've never been to a Nats home game so I assume it's fun to do, but it's certainly fun to *watch*. Kids love it, adults love it, the team loves it... IMO it's these kind of things that make attending a baseball game fun.",baseball

"I lived in DC 2012-16 (now in Philly) and have a co-worker who lives in NE DC and shares season ticket packages for both the Caps and Nats. He e-mailed me this morning saying that the feeling between the two teams at this stage right now is so similar it's scary -- both teams had years of great regular seasons and playoff flameouts, both entered the season with lowered expectations, Caps had to finally overcome the champion Penguins to make the conference finals, and the Nats had to overcome NL champ Dodgers. Everything is house money at this point but boy, it's hard to shut out the feelings that maybe this is the year.",baseball

"It’s annoying, because the Nats do get short shrift in these discussions; they’re probably somewhere in the top 5 teams in all of baseball this year. But trying to correct people about it is difficult because now they’re matched up against the Astros who...

They’re just the best team in baseball. Hands down. Probably one of the best teams in MLB history. Killer rotation, killer line-up, great bullpen, there are aces at every position. The team’s just silly.

Which isn’t to say that the Nats have no chance in the Series; I’m still (kinda) confident. The difference between the tippy-top team in baseball and the next 4 is noticeable but it’s not that big; with smart management and relaxed play they can easily hang with the Astros. But winning the series wouldn’t mean the Nats are the ‘better’ team in the way I usually think about that word.

They’ll be the *2019 World Series Champions,* among the very best in the world at what they do and able to perform beyond the limits of normal human ability for one glorious, incredible month. And that trophy’s a lot better than being “better” on paper and in tables of numbers

"Hey guys!!!! I think I found out what is up with Didi's odd bat flip. In my opinion, he knew he fuckin clobbered a dong shot from the moment it left his bat...I don't think there ever was any doubt in his mind that it was fair and, in turn, indeed a tallywhack. 

INSTEAD, I think that Didi is simply a stand-up kind of player and upon considering the circumstances of the homerun and the fact that the Yanks were then up 7-0, he decided to *not* execute the most dirty batflip the world has seen since Joey Bats' and subsequently caught his bat in his other hand before flipping it in an unprecedentedly swaggerly manner. I think if you replay the video and look at it with that in mind, it makes a lot more sense that he caught his bat before lethally flipping it instead of having awkwardly pimped a ball he initially thought to be foul

I like the angle that the Braves took by signing Acuña and Albies to extensions back in April this year.

No one still has figured out how Charlie Morton went from throwing 89-92 to 99 in one year when he came to the astros. Gerrit Cole magically starts sitting at 98-100 now. Both have a major increased spin rate. When players come to the astros they magically start throwing harder.,baseball

"In important games of the playoffs, many pitching changes are common, because each at bat matters. But also, in general, starting pitchers do not pitch the whole game like QBs in football. Most starters go between 5-7 innings of 9 in a standard game. Relief pitchers come in from what is called the ""bull pen"" and are a key part of the game.",baseball
"Jeffress last year because he’s dealt with substance abuse issues and anxiety throughout his career. Even this year he was crying after blowing a save in the regular season. He pours every ounce of passion into every pitch. Sometimes I think there’s a mental block there, especially in the big moments.",baseball
I love him because I know him as part of the Mets broadcast team and they're great together. I don't think I'd be crazy about him if I only knew him through the national broadcasts. He doesn't really bring anything special. But that's because he doesn't have Gary asking excellent questions.,baseball
"Not a dumb question at all. Basically, two reasons: the more hitters see a pitcher, the better they do, so you can keep them off-balance in higher-leverage games by switching earlier, but also because, since you don't have to worry about managing for the long term, all your pitchers can go all-out, like a car burning off fuel faster.",baseball
"The same guy that dishes the ball to Kyrie because he doesn't want the pressure shot is considered taking over a game? They got swept and he took more FGA's than anyone in 2018. He should be able to relentlessly score easier than anyone in the league because of his size and athleticism and it took him 10 years to learn how to do it. You can point out one single season that he actually did it in, yet they still got swept.",baseball

"Also for anyone curious, the simulation next to the one where The Rock is the President - Taylor's HBP in the wildcard game is called a foul ball after review and the Brewers avoid a late inning breakdown. Dodgers beat them in 5 only to lose the WS in 6 to - you guessed it - the Rays.",baseball

You can't just be up there and just doin' a balk like that.

1a. A balk is when you

1b. Okay well listen. A balk is when you balk the

1c. Let me start over

1c-a. The pitcher is not allowed to do a motion to the, uh, batter, that prohibits the batter from doing, you know, just trying to hit the ball. You can't do that.

1c-b. Once the pitcher is in the stretch, he can't be over here and say to the runner, like, ""I'm gonna get ya! I'm gonna tag you out! You better watch your butt!"" and then just be like he didn't even do that.

1c-b(1). Like, if you're about to pitch and then don't pitch, you have to still pitch. You cannot not pitch. Does that make any sense?

1c-b(2). You gotta be, throwing motion of the ball, and then, until you just throw it.

1c-b(2)-a. Okay, well, you can have the ball up here, like this, but then there's the balk you gotta think about.

1c-b(2)-b. Fairuza Balk hasn't been in any movies in forever. I hope she wasn't typecast as that racist lady in American History X.

1c-b(2)-b(i). Oh wait, she was in The Waterboy too! That would be even worse.

"Baseball has extreme changes in intensity.

You might be mosying around for 10 minutes than burst into rigourous sprint and acrobatic jumps in the next second, then back to 10 minutes of nothing. Then think about the extreme force players swing the bat or throw a ball, which have some crazy force outputs.

I feel this causes lots of stress on the body compared to lower intensity but sustained activity (ie basketball, soccer)

Finally, baseball players tend be older. Its rare for basketball players above thirty, but pretty common is baseball.",baseball
"Oh you got me. Literally never knew about mental issues in my life, never dealt with shit, so throwing a 101 level take that of course you didn’t perform any critical thinking for, just regurgitated from someone else, got me.

"Altuve sacrificed himself to get base-runners on 2nd and 3rd instead of 1st and 3rd or instead of getting a DP turned. You're right that they could have had Altuve on 3rd but they gambled to get an extra runner in scoring position and avoid the DP. Whether or not that was the correct decision is another story, but they executed it perfectly. 

Do you say it's a bad at bat when someone drops a sac bunt?...",baseball
"The Coors Effect is also about batting average, not just power since Coors actually has a very spacious outfield which is hard to defend. So while it was known that LeMahieu's power would play up, people weren't sure if he could hit for average outside Coors. Bandboxes are good for power numbers, not necessarily BA.",baseball
"The ""team of the decade"" can't be the Giants, they've just been too bad the last three years, and they are the closest we have to a decade defining team. There is no team of the decade that consistently won, including at least 1 World Series victory. The Astros were too terrible in the early part. This decade has been about parity",baseball
"Well, I'm sorry that you can't believe that.  I can believe it, as it clearly happens in this world.  It'd also be colossally stupid though, and hurt both him and the team, and for the team to then double down on it is more than just a drunken action. 

That said, if your judgement is ""This guy works this kind of job, so he's guilty,"" then maybe that's just a ton of blatant prejudice and you should look into that.",baseball
"&gt;At the end of a 162 game season there really isn't a ""better team on paper"".

Setting aside whether or not the Cubs actually were a better team, random shit happens over 162 games almost as much as it happens over 7 games; most teams with a specific talent level will end up anywhere within a range of EIGHT GAMES IN EITHER DIRECTION of what their talent level and production would predict, a good sixteen game range of wins that a team could produce.  The five-game difference between the Cubs and Brewers was well within the 'random shit happens' range.

Alternately you could argue that that 'what the team's quality is' just doesn't matter, but thats in a very similar vein as judging pitcher quality by wins.  So it wouldn't gain much traction around here.",baseball
"This wasn’t WAR. It was a study based on the “right” and “wrong” moves. So the difference in a full season of a manager making all correct compared to all incorrect would still only be 12 games. I wish I could remember more about it, it basically showed that managers were not very important, and could only effect a team so much.",baseball
"To each his own but I hear what you're saying, A-Rod USED to be good when he was still new and perhaps taking it a little more seriously, now he feels like he can get away with saying just about anything because he thinks the public loves him again, and his back-and-forth with Mendoza isn't of any quality nor is it humorous. Vaskersian isn't good either, nor is Dan Schulman on ESPN radio, nor is Joe Davis on national Fox broadcasts. They need to learn from the greats, not try to imitate them.",baseball
"Orlando, FL. Think college football is most popular, a lot of UCF, UF, FSU, UM fans. In terms of professional team in the city, I think Orlando City &gt; Magic. I felt like even when the Magic made their playoff run it wasn't a big deal and they're mostly viewed as a way for visiting fans to see their team play. Most casual people are more aware of OC than the Magic imo.

I dont think baseball is very popular here. Used to see billboards for Houston and Atlanta spring training. Dont really get the vibe of a baseball town which is why I'm surprised people suggest it for a Rays relocation.",baseball

"I can't believe some people were afraid because this game wouldn't be pitched by Verlander or Cole. Maybe I'm just thinking out of time here but Greinke scares me more. He, for a brief time, hit a higher top level than either of those guys and I always wonder when it'll come out again.",baseball

You can lose your job when it comes to black, but when it Asian, you just need a freaking apology???

Let me be clear, Racism is not okay of any kind but we need to treat everyone equal.",baseball
"The amount of whinging in this thread is absurd.  It’s been a good close game, the ump has been consistent with good and bad calls  between both teams.  Greinke has been great, Scherzer has been a grinder picking it up while battling inconsistent pitching and it’s caught up to him twice.  That’s the game story so far, why the complaint, enjoy the close game.",baseball
"Max had nothing tonight. Absolutely nothing. No command and his D+ stuff. 2 runs over 5 innings is goddamn impressive, given that. It's not what we needed (we really needed length) so it wasn't a good start, but it's still impressive that he managed to keep this game manageable for the offense to take the lead.",baseball
"It was a cool October morning in 1998 the day Rosalia saw it. Well, cool for the Dominican, at least. An approaching hurricane had filled the air with crisp tension. That’s what Rosalia assumed everyone was excited about as she entered the town square, where a crowd had gathered. Then she noticed at their center was a figure she couldn’t quite make out. As she got closer, someone in the crowd saw her and excitedly waved her over, “Doctor! Doctor!” Rosalia had been the only doctor in this place for many years. As she approached, she realized the figure was a young woman—holding a loosely swaddled child. The crowd pointed at the child excitedly, and at first Rosalia didn’t understand why. Until a gentle breeze, from that coming storm, moved the blankets, revealing something she thought impossible. Large, and *golden*, glistening in the Caribbean sun. The boy was more like a sculpted idol of an ancient god than a child. She had read of this in a textbook many years ago, but she always thought it a myth. She mumbled her diagnosis: “El tiene gran energía del bicho.” The crowd whispered her words back at her in awe. Rosalia met the young woman’s eyes. “¿Cual es el nombre del niño?” Smiling softly, the new mother responded: “Juan.”",baseball
"More pitches gives you more looks, which allows you to go deeper in the game. He can throw his slider the first time to through the order, and then go to a pitch that’s harder and breaks more the next time through. 

It plays well off his fastball in terms of velocity and plays well off his slider in terms of movement.",baseball
"You also need to subtract the starts he would've taken the place of, otherwise you're going to have over 162 starts. And that gets kind of subjective (which ones do you remove) which is why I didn't bother.

If you're getting into the weeds like that, it probably also makes sense to go with just a top 4, as no one is running a 5 man rotation in the World Series. 5th guy moves to the bullpen. Astros might even just go on a 3 man rotation.",baseball
"The biggest reason that regular season records are so less meaningful in the NHL is because the officiating dramatically changes. In the regular season, refs tend to be MUCH stricter with penalty calls. This strongly benefits highly skilled, technical teams. But when the playoffs roll around refs put away their whistles and the teams that relied on technique and taking advantage of powerplays get the shaft as less skilled teams start bashing away and getting away with it because the NHL wants to ""let them play.""",baseball

"I understand that by the letter of the rulebook, the decision was justifiable.  I'm saying that the rule is too vague, and in this particular case the ruling was, although not explicitly contradictory to the rulebook, unfair to the Braves.

I never suggested that ""he could still drop it"" is a reason to not call an out, you're putting words in my mouth.  I said until the fielder is positioned under the ball, I don't think it's fair to assume an out with ordinary effort, and this case is an excellent example of why.  The fielder was literally never even close enough to get leather on the ball.

The problem is the vagueness of the rule.  You keep throwing around phrases like ""can be caught"" and ""ball is catchable by an infielder"", but those phrases aren't adequately defined.  Again, the ball ""can be caught"" or is ""catchable by an infielder"" from the moment it left the bat, but I think we all agree that that would be too aggressive of an interpretation of the rulebook.  The rule should be clarified, or as I mentioned in another comment, should be scrapped since it isn't really needed to keep the batting team out of a double play.",baseball
From Houston originally but moved to Austin for about 10 years. My neighbor in Austin Hailed from Firebaugh. I moved back to Houston but he became my best friend. I became really close with his family and I just about visit them every years. It was a trip the first time I went. They don’t have a McDonalds or a Walmart. But they finally got a Burger King lol.,baseball
He’s gotten much better this season. Really worked hard on his defense in the off season. Everyone fucks up sometimes and it wasn’t a routine stop there it was just about in the dirt. Of course if they didn’t just get that strikeout I’d be pissed but it’s alright he’s getting better.,baseball
"It's a culture thing. As guys are coming up through the minors they're taught the way to play the game, the way to act on the field and in the clubhouse. That's why when Chapman and Olson came up they knew they couldn't afford to have distractions on the field or in the clubhouse and got rid of them. They were guys that came up with a culture of wanting to win and to work as hard as they possibly could.

When the team makes trades for young players, they pay attention to the stuff, to the talent, but they also pay attention to the makeup and personality. I call chemistry one of the intangibles of baseball, and it's something that rings true in each good A's clubhouse. When young players with positive outlooks on the league and work ethic come up and make it to the upper levels of the minors the old guys with a more pessimistic outlook on the game and league are traded.",baseball

"The decision to put Ubaldo in was made after the Os failed to score top 11, both were loose. So yeah as we both said, “we only need to score one” holds true for the 12th, but as I said before, that puts all the pressure on the Os cold offense to score that inning or they were relying on Ubaldo to pitch indefinitely and close. And while I hear what you’re saying about having Britton face the best hitters, Ubaldo was such an enigma he had no issue sitting down the best hitters if he was on, and would give up 5 runs to the bottom of the order if he wasn’t, it was more dependent on which Ubaldo you got than who he was facing.

The Os offense wasn’t touching anything, and Buck gambled that extending the game for the longest period against an also cold Jays offense was the best bet, and I get it. Just like the Jays, the Os would have just needed once bounce or one pitch to go right. It didn’t work but I get it, and the Jays were just the better team by that point.",baseball

"I'm 100% with you in spirit. The problem becomes defining what's a starter, what's an opener, and when a follower (is that the nomenclature?) should count as getting a ""start."" If we don't just give the start to the first person on the bump, who gets it? The person who pitches the longest? That could spell trouble if there's an extra-inning game like Game 3 of last year's World Series, when Nate Eovaldi *finished* the 18-inning game going 6 innings, longer than any other Red Sox pitcher. Is it the first pitcher, unless he goes less than 3 innings, and then it's the next pitcher? Then you'd be crediting starters with ""relief appearances"" (I guess; maybe the stat would be called ""opens"") if they get injured or are ineffective and unable to hit the innings minimum, even though they were intended to pitch the bulk of the game.

Maybe you're not talking about the stats, but just how we talk about the game. If you are talking about stats, I'd suggest the best thing is to leave it how it is for now, and just let the game evolve naturally for a few years to see how it might make sense to classify things. We have enough data about everything in baseball today that we could retroactively categorize pitchers' roles in five or ten years easily.

If you are just musing about how we talk about the game, then I agree, and I'm just interested to see how the language of the game evolves to fit the new roles that appear to be bubbling up out of nowhere.",baseball
"The whole purpose of that 45 foot long box on the way to first base is that it is where the runner is required to be.  I thought it was a bad call at first, but after reading the rule, it was clearly correct.  Problem is, umps never enforce the rule because it usually doesn't matter.",baseball
"I hate the Nats, but I respect them and their fans more this season than I ever have.

"No. In order to do that, the stadium would have to file a Criminal Trespass Order (CTO) with the police.

"the Nationals are done for a very long time

Our window has closed. Sad that we wasted the talent that we had the last 7-8 years but that’s how it is.

This season so far is unraveling that Rizzo is an overrated hack and Martinez is a bottom tier manager, both of which I’ve been saying for years.

Anthony Rendon will be gone next year and this team will officially turn in to crap, and the only thing we can hope is if Soto magically returns to rookie form.",baseball

"So, what do you guys think? Dave Robert is out if Dodgers don't win the ship this year? Mets are looking for one.

Edit: I bring this up because I saw that Mets are also looking at AJ Hinch and I think it would be even more unlikely that he gets traded to the Mets than Roberts.

"Zach Duke has somehow managed to pitch for every team in baseball, but never pitched in the postseason?

I've been inspired to check in on him. 2005-10 he was on the Pirates, so no postseason there. 

2011 he was with Arizona. They made the playoffs but he was presumably not on the postseason roster. Same deal in a brief stint with the 2012 Nationals and 2013 Reds. Jeez. Three straight years he pitched in the regular season for playoff teams, but all three times he failed to appear in postseason play. '14 he was in Milwaukee, '15 with the White Sox. No playoffs. In '16 he was excellent for the Cardinals, but they missed out on the playoffs by one game. Ouch. Stayed in St. Louis the next year and they missed the playoffs again. Wound up in Seattle to end the year last year, my records indicate they indeed missed the postseason. And now he spent this year in Cincinnati again. He's been tantalizingly close more than once but has never taken the mound in a postseason game.",baseball
"I doubt you are correct, rather technology is getting incredibly better and every pitch, shot, bump, reception, tackle, steal, check, etc is available for immediate review in high def by everyone watching with multiple camera angles.   That is what is causing this.  I doubt umpiring or referreeing is measurably worse than the past, it's just that we have the tech to crush them for every minor strike call barely out of the zone. Honestly, it's in baseball's best interest to force the networks to no longer show the strike zone box on each pitch.  That alone would decrease fan angst while watching baseball.",baseball
"Yeah, which is why its a judgement call by the ump if doing so interfered with the play at all. They wont call you out of it was inconsequential but if they see your foot on/over the line and think it had an impact then you get called out.

Whether or not it impacted the play is uhh... up for interpretation",baseball
"Ok. Turner was outside of the 3 foot lane the ENTIRE way down to first base. On his final step to first, he stepped FROM OUTSIDE the lane and landed on the bag. Because he started from outside the lane, he interfered with Gurriel catching the ball. Don’t you think?",baseball
"Lol are you ok? You can be off the baseline while running toward the bag, but you need to be directly in line before touching the bag and when there’s a play being made! Turner was literally dead centre when he hit the bag! Look at where his foot was when he hit it. Its not like he jumped from the “grass” to the bag lol",baseball
"&gt; The spirit of the rule is to protect baserunners and if you aren't doing that, then what is even the point of following the textbook word for word?

This isn't how laws or rules work in any setting. You cannot just apply laws willy nilly depending on if the spirit of the law, per one's interpretation, is met or not. There is no legal requirement that the spirit of the law must be met before the literal law can be applied. Laws are written to capture the ""spirit"" of the law, but sometimes they fall short and that's what interpretation is for (we literally have one third of the branches of the federal government dedicated to this) and why edge cases are so troublesome.",baseball

"I don’t care what any of you say.

The Yankees have been absolutely heartbreaking in the postseason since 2000 and the fans deserve better.  We squandered the tail end of the Core Four’s career by never giving them the support they needed.  We clawed back to relevance in 2009 only to get crushed two years in a row after that and then get stuck with Travis fucking Hafner’s farewell tour for a year.  We got so close in 2017 and then couldn’t hold it together.  We got crushed in 2018 because of the Sox’ incredible luck in having all their players be in the middle of career years.  And we’re about to get smothered here because of *a fucking rainout*.  If that postponement doesn’t happen, I guarantee that we’re able to win Game 4 and 5 and force short-rested Cole to pitch in Houston.  But no.  No sir.  The Yankees can’t have anything nice anymore because they had some good players 100 years ago and because they had actually competent management, unlike what we have today.  What we have today is a front office that is scared of its own shadow and won’t buy the pieces we need using our highly overrated farm system, a team that breezes through a regular season against a joke of an AL East and then hits real teams in the playoffs and squirms, and a manager who won’t admit that analytics are wrong sometimes and bench the fucking deadweights in must-win games.  

We’re not winning a Series with Boone.  Or Rothschild.  Or Tanaka.  Or Severino.  Or Judge.  Or Gary.  Or Stanton.  Or Didi.  The only competent players we have are Gleyber and LeMahieu and even then Gleyber has been shaky this series.  We cook our bullpen to a hockey puck and then wonder why we get eliminated on a bullpen day.  

We need a massive housecleaning and a reboot of our lineup.  And we need the support of r/baseball.  I know you hate us.  I don’t understand it, but I know.  But can you for one minute have a tiny bit of sympathy for us?  We’ve endured more pain than just about every other fan base in the last decade other than maybe the Mariners or Indians.  And it fucking blows to get laughed at when you’re already hurting.",baseball

"As a cardinals fan, nothing can match the awesomeness of 2011. If this year though I get the cubs choking their way out of the playoffs, brewers choking in the playoffs, Kershaw choking again, us ruining the nats lives for the millionth time, and beating the astros in the World Series, it'll be extremely close",baseball

St. Louis has a gigantic arch in their city, visible from Busch Stadium. Which is obviously meant as an invitation to all who visit to fuck the Cardinals.",baseball
"The difference between the Astros and Yankees has been the trades you pulled off around the core with Verlander Cole Grienke.  I mean you added three aces in three years where the Yankees continue to go in each year with a rotation that doesn’t cut it in October

However, my point about the rebuild was more its length they dumped the parts of the previous era when they needed to rather than clinging to them at the end like day the Phillies or Giants in recent memory and got a lot of talent out of it in a short time to field a team.",baseball
"Thats like saying a pop fly is a good hit if the fielders miss it. Its still early in the game with only 1 out, keep him at third and you have a better chance at bringing him home then banking on them screwing up the relay. If he is safe I wouldn’t call it a good play, Id call it a lucky play. Why would you rely on a playoff team to fuck up?",baseball
"Costas complained at one point that baseball was boring because the twins walked the bases loaded...meanwhile the bases were fucking loaded in a tight game with Gleyber at the plate 


Also, Smoltz made a comment about how Stanton was having good at bats but not getting anything out of them.  doesn’t seem bad but Smoltz said this right as Stanton drew his third walk of the game lol",baseball
"I have also seen this call multiple times at multiple levels and it's an interference call for me every time.  The way I was taught and have seen it called by others is that the judgment call isn't in regards to if the runner gave the fielders a lane/opportunity to make a play, but rather would the play have been made if the runner wasn't there at all.  If yes, and if the runner was not in the 45-foot lane, it's interference.

In this case, sure it was a bad throw, but it still would have been fieldable by Gurriel if Turner wasn't there IMO.  I don't see it as rewarding a bad throw by a fielder, but instead as punishing a runner for not being where they were supposed to be.",baseball
"I went into this Series expecting Houston to roll over the Nationals. I didn't know much about the Nats heading into the postseason.

Love that this is going a 7th game with a possible upset by the time this is over.

I have rather enjoyed this WS, just wish there were more baserunners, stolen bases. etc.",baseball
"So the call is Turner actually INTEREFERED with the first baseman?  JFC, I mean moving forward, if the first baseman is ever off the bag, it must be interference right?

Poor Joe.  The guy is sounding like a shill right now because MLB is forcing him to try and explain the unexplainable.

I mean...even the review he's talking about.  They had to actually tell the umps their own call wasn't reviewable.....and that took 10 minutes?",baseball
"Ok so Turner was thrown out because he interferes with the throw per Torre. 

So he’s supposed to take an even longer path to first base because the opposing team can’t make the appropriate throw?  Seems like bullshit to me.  If fielders are in the basepath then the runner is safe because of interference, so how does that not apply in this case too??",baseball
"Don't know, the umpires don't explain the reasoning. You're right that the rule talks only about impeding the fielder, the video and a few other sources talk about the call generally being made if a player gets hit with the throw.

From closecallsports:

The Rule: The relevant rule is OBR 5.09(a)(11), which states:
A batter is out for interference when—In running the last half of the distance from home base to first base, while the ball is being fielded to first base, he runs outside (to the right of) the three-foot line, or inside (to the left of) the foul line, and in the umpire’s judgment in so doing interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first base, in which case the ball is dead. [Batted ball exemption is inapplicable here]
*Important: ""Fielded to"" includes any ball thrown to first base, such as an F2-F3 double play try.

Rule 5.09(a)(11)'s associated comment states, ""The batter-runner is permitted to exit the three-foot lane by means of a step, stride, reach or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base for the sole purpose of touching first base.""",baseball
"2012 was kind of cheap. Home field advantage my ass. Probably even benefited the Giants. 

That was the first year of the new playoff format and only year they went with a 2 games at lower seeded team first then 3 games at home in the ALDS.  Verlander got a free game at home that year when he shouldn’t have gotten any.  But probably wouldn’t have changed much the way we play against him.",baseball
"So he's supposed to get up and run on every ball even though it's equally likely he'd run into the ball since he's having to cover every possible position of the ball?

It was a fluke, get over it. You have the lead, you're a game up, and you're playing the lowest paid team in baseball. You'll be fine.",baseball
"I know man, it's bollocks you guys are underappreciated. Honestly, after we clinched it was the most exciting thing about the rest of the season, watching these two teams go back and forth with the HRs. Keep faith, you guys just need pitching and I think you'll be a force. As it is, I can see you dominating the Central for the foreseeable future.",baseball
"It’s also worth noting that in 2017, when Hurricane Harvey was making its way through Texas, he offered free mattresses to those impacted by the hurricane.

"Lol, people aren't taking that well.

Other than Bostick's game being for more chips, the situations were pretty similar; he made a fatal mistake in a situation the team shouldn't have been in in the first place. And even then, his team still had a lot more opportunity to still win the game than the Brewers did here.",baseball

"The Nationals are done for a very long time.

Our window has closed. Sad that we wasted the talent that we had the last 7-8 years but that’s how it is.

This season so far is unraveling that Rizzo is an overrated hack and Martinez is a bottom tier manager, both of which I’ve been saying for years.

Anthony Rendon will be gone next year and this team will officially turn in to crap, and the only thing we can hope is if Soto magically returns to rookie form.",baseball
"No, it was a bad move. They weren’t building momentum, Greinke hung a change and Rendon didn’t miss. That was the 2nd hit he’s given up all game and was sitting at 80 pitches. There is no hindsight here, it was a bad move anyway you look at it. Even if the pen would’ve gotten out of the inning it still wouldn’t have been a smart decision.",baseball

"Valid. I never felt like it was pathetic from the Cardinals side though. Mikolas pitched a great 1-run game and tossed some sass back at Soto. There was lots of contact from the offense and some good discipline to draw walks. And many players have excellent facial hair; I am still in awe at the size of Bebbia's beard. 

They had a couple of great steals there, too.",baseball
"If he is in the lane and hits the glove on his final stride to the bag (as he comes into fair territory to touch the bag), it would not be interference. As he was never in the lane, there was never a time where he could touch the glove prior to reaching first.

Baseball and softball players are taught to run the lane from high school, if not earlier, and are called out for not running the lane from that same age. This is not a new or obscure rule.",baseball
"As an OG Nats *and* Caps fan, I know my share of heartache.  Watching them move the champagne from the Nats locker to the Cards locker hurt.  Physically.  

So tonight at the game when wet went up 7-0, I was calm. When the Cards scored four and threatened more, I was calm. When we won, unfortunately I was calm. I think my nerves have been cauterized.",baseball
"Hm, good question...

- [June 1st](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PIT/PIT201906010.shtml): Hader enters with 0 outs, runners on 2nd and 3rd. Gives up a home run to blow the save.

- [July 12th](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PIT/PIT201906010.shtml): Hader enters at the start of the 8th, gives up a leadoff home run to tie the game and blow the save.

- [August 1st](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/OAK/OAK201908010.shtml): Hader enters at the start of the 8th, gives up a walk and a home run to give up the lead and blow the save.

- [August 9th](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/MIL/MIL201908090.shtml): Hader enters in the 8th with 1 out and a 1 run lead after the last pitcher gave up a home run. Gets through the 8th fine, but gives up a home run in the 9th to tie the game.

- [August 13th](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/MIL/MIL201908130.shtml): Hader enters with 2 outs and runners on 1st and 2nd, gives up a home run to give up the lead.

So, in 2 of those 5 blown saves, yeah, he did come in with runners on. Less than half, but it is a good point to keep in mind.

...

I'll also note that the baseball gods are fucking with us a bit, because **every time he gave up the lead after entering the game in the 8th inning in the regular season, it was on a home run**.

They'd have beaten Greinke, Verlander, and Cole consecutively with the last game being on the road and having a total organizational budget of six dollars.

This is great, but Rays over Astros would definitely top it.",baseball
I’m so done with this team. This is what I mean by not getting too happy with 7 straight division titles and 100+ wins and being #1 in the NL because our team always chokes when game matters most. Kershaw sucks. You can’t be great if you can’t show up in the playoffs. I’m don’t with this team. The first team to win 100+ games in the season to be eliminated in the first round. Unreal.

"Some catchers squat, and other catchers like Maldonado (at least while he was with the Angels) and Sanchez will spread their favored leg out from their body.

Also makes it a little harder for him to block a spike ball.",baseball

"It’s not distance the ball travels though. By the rule it is effort by the infielder and it didn’t take “extraordinary” effort for the infielder to get under it. He was never at a full sprint nor had his back fully turned towards the infield

"Yes, but it just felt different. Unlike previous years when it seemed like nothing went DC's way, all the bounces seemed to be friendly. The team had a different aura. However you want to describe it, once they got past the Penguins it felt like a different sports world. This Nationals team reminds of that right now.",baseball
"Its pretty much something every fucking manager does in the league now and I fucking hate it so much. I mean really, the amount of tricky shit managers try to pull with pitchers in the last 3.5 innings is just stupid. 

It seems to always backfire if a run scores. I know it did every time this season for the Braves. It sure has felt like it has every time this post season too. 

This strategy needs to burn in hell.",baseball
"I kept saying that the Nats kept reminding me of the caps when they won it. Everyone counted the caps out after losing 2 to CBJ. They didn’t think we’d get past the Pens, just like always. They said Tampa was better. They said Vegas had been dominating the west so they’d dominate the east too. 

Same here - “oh look the Brewers are going to win the wildcard game. Eh okay the nats won, but LA will beat them. The Astros are going to sweep the nats.”",baseball
"Someone stole this and posted it on another forum so I'm putting my response here(Actually it was two seperate posts I'm combining into one).

 We cant be disappointing when the previous 20 years were worse. Hell not long before that we were desperate for a single playoff victory(Not a series victory...a single playoff game victory). 

Our decade began with an owner that had accumulated a massive  amount of debt(He turned negative money to start with into billions of dollars because rich people are horrible) and that was in the middle of a financially crippling divorce with team financial control having to be  forcibly seized by Major League Baseball.

Anyone looking at this team in 2010 would have been absolutely frightened at the Dodgers potential future.

We went from that garbage to anything but a world series victory being a  disappointment all in a decade. Despite the frustration, looking back it was anything but disappointing(As soul crushing as it may have been at times).",baseball
I mean most teams pitch 4 starters in the LCS. This is nothing new. We're not getting Verlander or Cole for 3 games regardless this series so no since in moving them up and making them pitch on short rest. We're going to feel really good about our chances if Cole wins Game 3 and then we have Verlander and Cole at home for sure if we don't get a win in Games 4 and 5.,baseball
"Coming from a casual fan (who baseball should be trying to bring in more of), the fact that an aging man is relying on a catcher to frame where the ball was caught to make a call is a major deterrent.   


However, if you were asking a legitimate question here and not pushing an agenda, I would say framing is playing a big factor in these calls going sideways.",baseball
"I doubt the purpose of the rule is for this situation. It is for those little dribblers in front of the plate that the catcher picks up and has no throwing lane if the runner isn't in the foul territory runner's lane. A perfect rule would have a clause to only apply in those situations, but then you are relying on umpire's judgement for that case, and I'm sure this sub is a fan of more judgement calls for umpires.",baseball
"Reason why I'm hoping astros don't win it all. Went to college down in houston years ago, when i used to watch or talk about baseball all i heard is “baseball is boring”, now those same people are walking around wearing astros gear and were celebrating when they won the world series like they gave a shit before the playoffs started that year.",baseball
"Yeah he looked unbelievably great but was understandably pretty gassed at the end. I fully expect him to be just as good and rested, but I guess I'm just saying I have no idea how a human body reacts and I wouldn't be surprised if overworking your arm under such intense pressure might need more than a normal rest period.",baseball
"Oh that would've been a great series. 

2011 after the run the Rays had to knock out the Red Sox, as a follow up to that incredible game 162. 

In any case, I think a Rays/Yankees playoff series that goes the distance is what we really need to cement a great rivalry, we've both been competitive the last decade which is good, but a game 7 ALCS would just take it to the next level. Win or lose. The games next year would be *incredible* if that happened.",baseball
"I feel the same way but for the Giants. Yeah it sucks when our down years are very bad but thinking about the 3 WS makes it all better. The sucky parts also amplify how awesome those championships were. In addition, the dodgers winning 7 straight division titles puts into perspective how difficult winning it all is. I dont mean to hate, because I'm not; I'm actually giving them credit. 

Simply, it's just nice and easy to go back to those 3 WS to relive the moments. Whereas it would be difficult to find the best moments of the 7 straight division titles with the disappointing endings that eventually happened in each of their runs.",baseball
Every team has assholes though. You're using an imaginary quantity you can't prove as an excuse to make a generalization. The ironic thing though is you're trying to explain that being an asshole is a bad thing yet based on your post history you're being the very thing you say makes a fanbase bad.,baseball
"I’m seeing a lot of comments from Dodger “fans” that read the same as they did last year: trade him, release him, he’s trash, etc.

Now I’m not saying he didn’t play a part in what just happened (and I love Kershaw to death), but those kind of comments are the same hot takes I see every year when we lose. So basically, it’ll be hot takes for a while, the bandwagoners will leave, and the leftover diehards will have their honest analysis and still remember he’s one of the greatest pitchers of all time.

I’m sure you could change a few words and say that about any fanbase venting about any player.

By the way, I blame our offense going cold after the 2nd a lot more than Kershaw getting cheated on one pitch and serving a quick meatball on the next.",baseball

"I don't know that they would have won the other night if something different is done, but if we didn't we'd be down to an elimination game with Scherzer starting same as we are now. I would have tried to get Sanchez to go another inning or hopefully even 2 if things go really well. I might have gone to Austin Voth at some point, but he doesn't seem to be on the radar at the moment for some reason. 

And Martinez is the 2nd worst manager I've ever seen. I wouldn't want my kid to be on his little league team. He doesn't seem to be a terrible guy, but he's shit at his job. He's cost us many wins over the last 2 years. It's almost like hiring someone with no management experience wasn't a good idea.",baseball
"Yeah, what exactly do you want from your pitchers when the offense scores literally zero runs?  You have to score at least once to win.

Flaherty, while maybe not the elite pitcher he's been the past month or two, still had a great game.  Maybe even more impressive since he struggled a little bit but still got it together and made a solid start.",baseball
"Grats to y'all slightly more southern bros. Was a fun series (how did no home team win?) with a crazy Game 7 ending (that late game rally was insane).

"&gt; that screams of panic if I'm being completely honest

He literally explains that he had targeted the Kendrick spot as where he wanted to use Harris before the game. How is that a ""panic decision""? Idk if it was a *good* decision but it honestly seems fairly calculated rather than panic-y.",baseball
"It's because certain fans among us treat other franchises fans like they are garbage. They flaunt the 27 rings argument like it means something today. They have an arrogant attitude towards baseball and are overly critical of the players (see the hatred of Stanton r/NYYankees and Twitter when he doesn't hit a homerun)

Yes, historically they have been the best team in American sports but in the 25 years, I've been alive there are only 5 rings. Even that is still impressive but I've always been a ""what have you done for me lately"" so I find the argument stupid. 

The media also drums up every dumb thing the fans do at Yankee Stadium even though way worse happens in Philly and Boston all the time. We're by no means innocent but sports stadiums are a group think/mob mentality at it's worse. I tend to give a pass to chants/throwing things on the field whereas a single guy being a dick is just on him (every where not just NY). 

The Greinke thing was fucked up but the Dobnak thing was funny and even Papi made a joke about it on national TV. ""Hey Twins instead of Uber, maybe you should find tomorrow's starting pitcher at Target!"" And no one freaked out about that.

I love the Yankees and consider this season disappointing but in a couple of weeks, I'll be more rational and realize that only 1 team ends up happy and that Houston was a slightly greater team the entire season and this series. 

Go Yanks.",baseball

Series against them down the line are the reason we didn't get the best record in the sport and I'd forgotten until it was pointed out in the thread for this game that the Red Sox came back from 7-0 to win a game in the ALCS and still lost the series to the Rays.

"It’s not going to happen. Your arguments are well put and make sense, but it really boils down to Ruth being the first icon of the modern game of Baseball as we know it. Every sport has one who people will never stop endlessly making comparisons too. 

Look at basketball as a prime example. People will make claims that Lebron is the most dominant player or something but at the end of the day I would still put Michael Jordon as being the icon of modern basketball despite playing in a totally different era. (Although I’m not sure he would still lead the league if young and healthy)

Football is a rare example of the current icon being still in the league, but make no mistake, Tom Brady will be the icon of American football for decades to come. 

It’s just what people gravitate towards. Ruth, like MJ and Brady, is the most popular player *ever* from his respective sport. There will never be people who aren’t drawing comparisons.",baseball

In addition to lower back vertebrae and nerve issues, it seems like cervical issues also occur in baseball players with some frequency (less than the lower back, of course) based on some research papers I read. 

I have severe spinal stenosis from my C3 to C7 vertebrae at the vertebral junctions sourced from some years of BJJ. Despite physical therapy helping out, I always have some mobility issues, pain, and numbness on the right side of my upper body, ranging from my neck to my fingers. Several times a year though, I will get a nasty flare-up which causes me to be unable to lift up my right arm. My last flare-up happened after my buddies and I went to a bullpen to throw some pitches.

"Technically, they're the third division.

Upon restructuring to three divisions in 1994, the AL East had the Blue Jays (1993), Tigers (1984), Orioles (1983), Yankees (1978), and Red Sox (1918). They kept this distinction until 1998, when the Rays joined the AL East, the Tigers moved to the AL Central, and the Brewers to the NL Central.

However, the NL East is the first division in which every team can claim a title as a member of that division (Tigers last won as AL East, Twins as AL West, and Indians as just AL as it was before divisional play)",baseball
"&gt; so who fuckin' cares?

Anyone who isn't a complete fucking moron? Anyone who actually values competitive integrity? 

The ball is deader than we've seen since 2015-2016 and it has a tremendous impact on how basically every single aspect of the game is played. How people swing, how people pitch, what pitches they use, defensive positioning, etc. all change drastically when you are seeing big of a change in the drag on the ball. 

We played an entire season (last three seasons, really) under very specific circumstances. They have changed those with no warning and while lying about it for the playoffs. Of course it fucking matters. 

&gt; The playing field is level since every teams have to deal with it

This is equally a bullshit line of thinking. Teams that have designed themselves specifically around the long ball are going to obviously be impacted significantly more than teams that are not. Teams that are focused more around putting the ball in play, like the Nationals, are obviously going to be harmed less than a team like the Yankees. 

So the question is not 'Who Fuckin' cares?'. The question is who does *not* care? The answer is casual, shitty fans or people too fucking stupid or lazy to spend more than thirty seconds considering what a drastic change this has had on the way the post season has played out, and that the MLB making this change for the playoffs in secret quite specifically helped certain teams.",baseball

No chance of landing Cole, or Ryu, but reasonable deals with these guys can hold it down until Houck comes up and j believe Darwinzon returns as a starter.

Those 3 years they were worth on average over 6.5 fWAR EACH(80.1 fWAR total), but they weren't able to make much of it.

I think we've seen a watershed call like the Chase Utley call in the 2015 NLDS. There, the umpires (imo) refused to follow the strictest letter of the law, instead doing what most umpires do under the circumstances and valuing the takeout slide. Here, it might be the opposite - a strict adherence to the rules may or may not be a departure from tradition. (Let's be real - almost nobody runs in the lane.) Both calls make us think about the rules, why we have them, and how they can be improved.

I think it's true that, even if Turner's last step would always have put him in that location, he was violating a rule to prohibit an unfair advantage in exactly this kind of situation - a throw from near home plate to first base. My immediate thought is, because Turner did something bad, (running in fair territory down the whole line which *could* have interfered with a throw to first), he opened himself up to liability in the event that he interfered.",baseball
"I think people are missing the forest for the trees here. They don't *know* which balls are which. MLB has shockingly low control over what's happening with these balls. The playoff batch could just be a different batch than the ones during the regular season, and then no one knows until the playoffs start that things are different. MLB has no reason to want to *decrease* HRs during the playoffs, when most casual fans are watching. 

This isn't malice. It's incompetence.",baseball
"Download the Pro Baseball Radio app. It was a lifesaver.

Also, the Spanish language broadcast was fantastic if you understand even a little bit. Every strikeout the guy would yell, ""SIIIIIIENTATE!"" - or sit down. When we turned a double play in game 4 he said something like a double play is a pitcher's best friend, something about a little dog and then barked twice.

I called him the anti-Girardi.",baseball
"Kershaw is just as garbage in the WS come on man. He has a 5.4 era, do we not remember his terrible last world series? Verlander has been less than stellar in the world series but he shows up the rest of October. Kershaw good postseason showings you can count on 1 hand.",baseball
"Yeah being down 2-0 is bad, but it’s not insurmountable. Plus, it’s not like they’re getting blown out. They may be getting shutdown on offense, but they’ve held a good offense to just 5 runs in two games. The defense is there, now they just need to wake up the bats.",baseball
"Here’s to hoping for positive regression to the mean. 

He didn’t look bad in game 2. Only gave up two runs early and then scoreless 2 through 6. He put a couple runners on in the 7th but the game was still in hand when he exited. And then it quickly wasn’t. 

I’m hoping he watched film yesterday with Cole. Cole made some adjustments in Game 5 and it obviously showed.",baseball
"&gt; They've been way too talented to not win the world series yet, and should have never even been this close to the Nats, let alone actually lose.

Hold up.

Obviously the Dodgers have been a great team the past several years, but it's *incredibly* hard to win the World Series. And getting there in back-to-back years is incredible. In 2018, they lost to a 108-win Red Sox team and in 2017 they lost to a 101-win Astros team. Neither of those teams were slouches. Getting tails on two flips isn't weird.

And saying this series shouldn't even be close does both the Nationals and Dodgers a disservice. Despite a 19-31 start, the Nationals finished with the 3rd best record  and the second best Pythagorean Record in the National League. From May 26th, the two teams had basically identical records. These two teams were more evenly matched than people realize.

Add to that the fact that the playoffs are a crapshoot, we shouldn't dismiss this series as a hard choke job.

Good series, Dodger-bros.",baseball
"I'm your typical young adult transplant to DC who has adopted the Nats. Especially with the Sox not being so good the past few years, it has been fun to be a Nats fan.

This year I had my first kid and have a pretty generous paternity policy, and during that period at home I watched lots of Nats games with my new son. This was around the time the team started to turn things around. I've watched more baseball this season than I have since high school. 

Anyways last night...seeing Stras give up early HRs was scary. That's Scherzer's MO but it looked to me like Strasburg just didn't have it. So I was pleasantly surprised when he limited them to those 3 runs the rest of his outing. Getting baserunners on was encouraging, but also demoralizing how many were left behind.

When we started the 8th, I seriously expected either Rendon or Soto to homer. Having them both go long was fantastic. Rendon-Soto-Kendrick was the key to winning offensively and it showed.

Kendrick's grand slam was the only time I shouted out loud last night (wife and baby were asleep). I thought that was just going to be a sac fly (yes the balls are juiced, but they're juiced for everybody!) and the bullpen would have to close out a 1 or 2 run lead. Seeing Dodgers fans file out made me feel more confident but not quite there.

Obviously Hudson has been better than Doo as of late, but I'm glad Doo got to close this one out. Hudson has been a rental, a fine rental, but Doo is a Nat (hopefully it stays that way but it's a business). What a catch by MAT...Robles probably can make that catch too, although maybe not with a tweaked leg. 

I'm thrilled for this team and excited for tomorrow. Go Nats!

EDIT: You know what brings a happy tear to my eye? The crowd after Soto's hit in the wild card. [5:56 on this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux28GvtT1YA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=355). People going crazy, throwing their beer in the air, STAY IN THE FIGHT!",baseball
"Both teams have drastic home and away splits. 

The Astros are monsters at home(.878 OPS home and .819 away) while the Yankees are monsters away. (.846 away and .809 at home). 

Yankees pitchers held a .709 OPS against at home and a .799 away. Yankee Stadium killed offence this year. 

Houston pitching had a .683 OPS at home and .678 on the road.

Definitely gonna be an interesting series if it happens.",baseball
"Plus the length of the games isn't doing the sport any favors. Games 2 and 3 took over four hours and Games 1 and 4 took over 3 hours 40 minutes. How many events are people willing to sit around for that long outside of football games? For example, the ratings for the Oscars have really downhill for the past five years or so and a lot more people like to watch movies than baseball games. And speaking of movies, how often would you be willing to sit around for over three and a half, four hours to watch a movie? How about a golf tournament or a five set tennis match? Probably not very often, right? So why would anybody expect people to sit around that long to watch a baseball game?",baseball
"&gt;&gt; Like say, could the pitcher hike the ball like a football and still be legal?

&gt;Rule 6.02(a)(6) says it's a balk if ""The pitcher delivers the ball to the batter while he is not facing the batter.""

But what if the pitcher is looking at the batter through his legs when he hikes the ball?",baseball
"It’s always funny to me that people bring up our 2014 rotation in “can you believe they never won?!” conversations. Our team’s collective ERA+ was 97. Scherzer was good, but not *scherzer*, Anibal took a step back from 2013, people legitimately thought Verlander was washed, etc. That team was powered by its offense and improved defense from getting Kinsler for Fielder. 

I wasn’t really surprised when we lost in 2014, but I was *devastated* when we lost in 2013. *That* was the team I thought could pull it off, Miggy’s defense at 3B aside.",baseball
"Alright, I'm a bit confused here. How the hell did those RBIs count if Soto was tagged out between 2nd and 3rd? I don't know the details of MLB rules but I at least know that if someone were to run and make it to home when someone else (the current batter) was being tagged out then the RBI would not count (think a ground out). When or where did this factor change?",baseball
"2018 Red Sox were also amazing. Two really good teams went at it and the Red Sox won. 

Also, I re-watched some game recaps last month and was reminded that Benintendi made some game-saving diving catches in LF that if he had missed, the Astros would’ve pulled out a game or two. That guy was a 2018 playoff hero for Boston.",baseball
"The worst are the people who get too hung up on small differences, or who try to use one number to compare very different types of players.  Would you rather have Gerrit Cole, or Christan Yelich?  They have similar WAR this last year.   But you can't then say that they would have the same effect on any new team they might join.",baseball
"Listen people who say “technically correct”, this play happens about 5000 times during the regular season and it’s literally never called....because it’s a JUDGEMENT call and everyone and their blind aunt can see the runner is not interfering on the play. It’s a stupid rule that has been enforced twice in 10 years despite occurring 1 in 20 games, just quit defending it.",baseball
"I don’t really have a problem with this instance and Bregman didn’t need to apologize. I see it as a non-issue. 

However I think if Bregman did the shuffle and stared down the pitcher like Soto did to Greinke, this sub would explode with more Bregman hate. Fact is this sub will scrutinize Bregman for being cocky but not certain players.",baseball
"The face on the player model for Chapman in The Show 20 should be permanently frozen with that smile.

God that was heartbreaking, but you couldn’t have asked for a better ending to a gritty series. I only wish the Astros played with this much grit against the Red Sox last year, but I guess they were being generous and said “you can have this one, we will just take next year’s”.",baseball

"Ooooooookay. Let's go down the list.

1. 2B is not a higher skill position than CF. They're pretty comparable, with many giving CF the nod in terms of skill and impact on the game. It's usually something like SS &gt; CF &gt; C &gt; 2B, some quibbling in there. 

2. Because a player's individual talent cannot bring their team to the postseason alone. Remember, a 10 WAR player is considered god-tier, and considering that a team full of 0 WAR players would win like 50-60 games, that won't even bring them to .500. And it's hard to win postseason awards or crowns if the rest of your team is so dogshit that they can never get to the playoffs.

3. Trout has ***two*** MVP awards, plus a Rookie of the Year, and hasn't finished outside the top 5 in MVP voting since his pre-Rookie season, where he only played 40 games.

4. Trout's career OPS is 1.000. Altuve's is .827.

5. While WAR is not always a definitive look at a player's actual quality, more of a decent starting point... look, Trout's got a career bWAR of 72.5. Altuve's only at 38.5. And Trout's actually played ***fewer*** games than Altuve.

6. There's only been one year where Altuve's had a better bWAR than Trout: 2017, with Altuve having an 8.1 bWAR compared to Trout's career-low of ""only"" 6.6 (excluding that 40 game pre-Rookie season).

Seems pretty cut and dry to me, dude.",baseball
It's not all on Kershaw. With how they played this season I was pretty sure the Dodgers would get at least 1 run in the 8th and then bring in Jansen or they would walk it off in the 9th. Kelly is more to blame but maybe we all just expected him to fail.,baseball

"That’s fair. I think the way I’ve seen the stat used (by fans and by broadcasts) is as a way to suggest that these teams are somehow equal, when the Astros have been better in the underlying, more predictive measures.

"except if Turner followed the rule and took the extra step out of his line, the interference doesn’t happen and either he beats it cleanly or the extra step he should have taken slows him down enough that he doesn’t, but if the ball is still unplayable for Gurriell, he doesn’t get called for interference.",baseball
"Right. This isn’t football where they are trying to  make sure a receiver was in bounds or out of bounds, this a core element of the game. Maybe THE core element of the game. Honestly I think human umps have gotten much more accurate over the last decade or so and I don’t really have a problem with how the game is called now. It’s like poker - sometimes you do the right thing but still lose. Sometimes you let a ball go by that’s a half inch off the plate and it is called a strike. Luck is part of the game. You can’t remove it. The Braves were about 1/2 from winning their series where a flare went off Freeman’s glove. Bad luck. It’s a game. Let’s keep it a game.",baseball

I worked my way up to the 80 and I could hit it but I was pretty much swinging the moment the ball came out of the machine.

The Twins are a feel good team, and I think have a bright future ahead of them. Them being a small market and their post season struggles makes them less known. Free agents don't usually sign in Minnesota, but they do have talented young players. The Indians have had been a premier organization esp regards to winning with a small market for a long long time. They're a good team now, and there's not much of a bias against them besides their fans being a bit desperate for a championship (less now since they got one in basketball). The Tigers had a premier owner in Mike Illitch who'd sign the free agent well aware he'd lose money overall, however bad choices in a ""win-now"" strategy ended up in devastating their future.

"The ideal rotation for the Astros is: 

- Verlander (1), Cole (2), Greinke (3), Miley (or Bullpen game) (4), Verlander (5), Cole (6), Greinke (7).

But if they want, they have the flexibility to:

- have Greinke to pitch in home games only if they think he won't pitch well at Yankee stadium (switch him with Cole in the above list and pitch Games 2 and 6).

- pitch Verlander and Cole on short rests for Games 4 and 5, respectively, if the series goes away from them early. e.g. if the Yankees are up 3-0 (or maybe even 2-1) going into Game 4, you better believe Astros would put in Verlander in a must win game on the road. And then depending on how that game goes, you pitch Miley or Cole for Game 5. And Game 5's are typically critical (both teams have played 2 games at their homes, and Game 5's are a big swing game); you really want Verlander pitching here.

Being pushed to Game 5 in the ALDS removes this flexibility.

Assuming they win this series in 5 games, their ALCS lineup is now:

- Greinke (1), Verlander (2), Cole (3), Miley (4), Greinke (5), Verlander (6), Cole (7)

"As a hockey fan that camera is not an end all be all and likely wouldn't work great in baseball.  There are times in hockey where you see the puck disapear in the goalie's equipment and it's clear as day the equipment itself is behind the goal line.  But because the puck disapears, the ruling is then because no one can see it, it can't be determined 100% it's a goal.

So considering in baseball by it's nature, the ball goes into a glove at first... you'd likely run into some of those issues",baseball
"It is an absolute shame that this is what people will be talking about instead of Stras dominating. Terrible call, obviously wasn't trying to interfere and literally could not react in time when the ball got there. What the hell was he supposed to do? People touch the grass running down the line all the fucking time.",baseball
"Meh, I just disagree. Celebrating a dinger is fine, being a prick and showing up your opponent is worthy of getting plunked your next time up as far as I'm concerned.

"Well hey they’ll be ready for game 7, I’m sure that’ll mean a lot if they lose tomorrow.   
  
I’d much rather have worse odds in game 7 if it means I get to actually play game 7. Anything can happen in one game of baseball. If that makes me crazy, then so be it.",baseball
"That's all past me now. 

Last year, I only watched Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals with a friend who loves hockey. 

As to the NFL, I followed the Oilers to Tennessee for a bit, but have grown away from football.  I don't like the brain damage caused by repetitive hits.",baseball
"My bad re. the catcher, but the larger point is still there.

But I think we're still talking past each other. He can answer the question without cutting his teammate. Questions get framed to provoke dramatic answers. Dodge it or deflect. Don't let someone create the narrative that this game's on Acuna, as a lot of Braves fans on here seem to be interpreting his answer.",baseball
"I mean the team as a whole is clearly frustrated by his actions, the answer was mature. Acuña is getting the blame because he's a superstar. It comes with the territory. ITs not all his fault we lost but he does share some of the blame no matter how well he played and this lightning rod of blame is just a part of being THE guy. 

Same way ARod caught alot of vitriol, Harper gets alot of things said about him, Machado, etc.",baseball
"Seriously tho. Invoking the likes of Hillsborough to defend grown adults singing along to an organized Baby Shark to try and generate an atmosphere at a sporting event from a slight piss-take, is not a great look. It probably steps across a line in the sand and I'm not usually sensitive about stuff like this.",baseball
i think it’s becoming very clear that the dodgers succes is from the players doing what they have to when they have to do it despite dugout decisions. which is odd to say after their elimination i know. their analytics team has allowed them to set them up for games but when it comes to the execution and detailed logistics there’s a gap. there’s something missing and player talent ain’t it.,baseball
"Fuck Domingo German♾ for the shit he pulled. He fucked this team with his stupidity. I don’t care how good he was this year. Fuck him for being a selfish motherfucker. Fuck him for laying a hand on a woman. Fuck him for fucking us like this. Get fucked, Domingo. I don’t care if you never pitch for the Yankees again.",baseball
"Buying Gerrit Cole in the offseason certainly wont fix the Yankees inability to get hits when the runners are on base. They need another approach. With a hitting lineup this good you certainly dont need a pitcher like Gerrit Cole to win a World Series. What you need is a better manager, hitting coach, whatever it is. But you certainly dont need a new starting pitcher. Youll just end up in the same scenario you are in now next year - Your pitcher gives up like 2 runs, and you wont even be able to get 3 runs to put the game over. Or your pitcher will give up 3 runs and you wont be able to get 4 to put the game over. Thats just how its gonna be.

EDIT: I posted this before the home run LMAO",baseball
That’s the exact point they’re making. There’s tons of people putting Nats fans on blast telling them they shouldn’t care about blown calls since they’d lose anyways or that accusing Nats fans of incorrectly blaming the umps for the result of the game. Check out my comment history for tons of this.,baseball
"It would be like protesting a strike call.  It's a judgment call, and those can't be reviewed.  The umps didn't review the play, they reviewed whether or not the Nat's could protest.  It was decided that they couldn't protest.  That was what the ""review"" was actually about.",baseball
"The basic rule states that runners heading to first base must run within the first-base running lane, which includes the chalked lines. Both feet must be within or on the lines. This is to help ensure that defensive fielders have a fair chance to throw the ball to first and/or catch it and get the runner out. There are two exceptions to this rule: Runners can step out of the lane at the last minute, when they're trying to touch first base via a final step, stride, reach or slide. And runners can head to first without running in the lane at all -- either to the right or left of it -- as long as they don't interfere with any throws by defensive players, and both of their feet are outside the lane",baseball
"I remembered watching Stras’s first start with the Nats and I remember how much he meant to y’all as the potential future ace of the franchise. To see him go all out today and throw an absolute gem in probably the most important game of his career, it’s just amazing to see thinking back all those years.",baseball
"I mean the lane is where it is for a reason. It makes it safe for the 1st baseman to have a foot on the base. It's not a straight line from the batters box depending on which side you bat from, but that's known since beginning of time- see advantage LH vs RH. If you just ran straight it would be across the infield and that's basically what he did, he was running in teh infield. It wouldn't have mattered had he simply beat the tag, but he knocked the glove off. It's accurately called and basic as hell. This sub is outraged for no reason at all.",baseball
"Where he steps on the bag is immaterial. It's where he runs.  Because the judgement can happen well before the base.

He's supposed to run in the runner's lane. It's as simple as that. For the first 45 feet, he can run where he likes. For the last 45 feet, he must run in the runner's lane or the umpire may use his judgement to determine whether or not his running interfered with either the throw or the catch. 

You can literally be called out for running outside the box if the umpire judges that you made the fielder adjust his throw. And it's both feet. 

There is no other consideration. He should run in the runner's lane.",baseball
"And I can’t get a bee tattoo that’s under 3 inches because “it’ll be too small to even do.” I think most tattoo artists just aren’t good enough for a simple bee tattoo that I freaking want to be like an inch and a half in body length.

"One part of me is laughing my ass off because the cardinals deserved to lose and Yadi and Shildt are scum.



Another part of me is disgusted that we lost to a team that was inferior almost all across the board



ANOTHER part is crying blood because the Nats made it to the series in 14 years before we even made it back to an LCS in 20.



Then to top it all off, i'm laughing my ass off that Bruce Hepbern's big dumb face is in absolute shambles on a team that blew half a billion to be in 4th place. 



So, in short, i want to die.",baseball
"It really is phenomenal. I was sad in the brewers game bc I thought Hader would shut us down and then Soto comes through. 

Then I was even more sure Nats would lose when they were down 3-1 in the 8th against the Dodgers. I was perplexed why Kershaw was still in, then back to back hr and rest is history. Just an incredible page in baseball history.",baseball
"The biggest factor other than if our lineup can actually hit Verlander or Cole is how long the starters can stay in. Tanaka seems to turn into Whitey Ford in the post season, but Paxton is notorious for the 1st inning home run (at least one) and Severino is still obviously still more or less in Spring Training mode. His outting in Minnesota gave me heart palpitations, although in the end he kept the Twins' bats silent which is no small task. If they can keep the Astros quiet and hand the game off to the bullpen, Yankees will succeed. It helps the team has learned to play small ball this year as well.",baseball
"&gt;In a Tennessean piece from early 2017, former Houston Oilers quarterback Warren Moon said that the experience of getting his No. 1 retired by the Titans in 2006 was strange since he never wore a Titans jersey.

Would it not make more sense for him to be honored by Houston? It's whackadoodle that Tennessee would honor him. Oilers history is Houston history.

Stop telling me that I would take Expos history because I wouldn't. Jordan Zimmermann's no-no was the first in Washington Nationals history. I think Pedro might have had one with Montreal but I don't know and I don't care.

As a Yankees fan the ump has sucked towards both sides. It's legit my biggest pet peeve in baseball how so much error in calls are allowed in a big game like a regular season 1 of 162 it's not as important but should still not be allowed . But Let's just get a computer going already In 2019.,baseball
"I really think this game is way more of a knock on the modern philosophy.

No matter how juiced the balls get, or how many homeruns you can hit. Baseball is about getting on base, and driving said baserunners home. Solo dingers just aint it, and it's what bit yall in the ass.",baseball
Too bad Nats left so many on base. Astros were certainly trying harder tonight.  Looking forward to tomorrow's more exciting game. Feels like a must win for both teams. Are the Nationals going to switch jerseys? I can stop making jokes about Soto drinking his juice now. Glad he can openly drink the good stuff today,baseball
"With Nomar, that shit was almost painful to watch though. Like it was pretty obvious he wasn't doing it to fuck with the pitcher. It was watching someone with ocd doing their thing. So much nervous energy. Might have been annoying but definitely not like the toolbag in this video grabbing his crotch and shit.",baseball
"Not according the the Astros PGT. The comments are fucking hilarious. Literally multiple unironic “so glad we got Osuna” and “he’s actually a nice guy” and “he’s really not that bad when you think about it.”

EDIT: “So happy that we picked this guy up. Everybody deserves a second chance.”

“OSUNA MATATA”

‪”What a fucking save by Roberto Osuna. Hard not to root for a guy like him with all the outside pressure surrounding him.”

Downvote away I guess? Funny how the term Fake News always seems to come from the same general type of person. The whole PGT is pure salt/vitriol.",baseball
I'm sorry buddy but Jeff wilpon needs to keep his nose out of baseball decisions if the Mets want to compete consistently. You guys have what seems to be a great young core but it won't matter if Jeff and Brodie go out and sign terrible contracts and trade for bad contracts in the offseason. If the team is gonna be run with a mid range budget. They need to invest more in scouting and analytics and start beefing up the farm. I wish you success against every team not the Yankees but I'm little tired of the Mets fans hating the Yankees. Don't blame us because of the Mets are a circus.,baseball
"Yes. I specifically watch out for it when watching games and notice it every so often. I try really hard to follow the ball and not the catcher's glove. It's part of the fun of watching a game for me, but I absolutely understand why most people would not think this is a strike the first time looking at it.",baseball
"You’re probably right about hockey, it’s probably why every series goes 7 and it’s chaotic.

But nfl not so much , I mean yeah you may get a hot QB occasionally, but for the most part you’re gonna have your Tom Brady’s or the elite QBs kicking ass at the end win or lose .

You know what you’re gonna get. Baseball is crazy random, you can get 4 hits one game, go hitless the next 3, etc .",baseball
"The argument in this situation is that you have a spot in the order that the offensive team has to plan around, rather than just sending up the next qualified hitter and not worrying about whether it can kill a rally or whether he'd be better off bunting because a productive out is better than what he'll probably do.

Yes, I get that it's lame to watch a pitcher make an out 9 out of 10 times, but the strategy involved in trying to either minimize the odds of that happening (pinch hitter or double switch) or making the most of it (sacrifice) is worth the usual pair of relatively dead PAs in the first trip or two through the lineup. It's certainly subjective, but I believe every decent player should be required to hold a bat *and* wear a glove.

Plus now and then the pitcher gets a hold of one and it feels great. And I like that pitchers can increase or decrease their value based on whether they can hit a little bit.

Still, upvoted because it's a worthwhile contribution to the discussion. I hate people who knee-jerk downvote contrary opinions, even when they're good comments otherwise.",baseball
"Idk if we will be playing game 1 in the Bronx or Houston, do they Rays really have a choice of what pitchers they use Thursday?    The Astros aren't going to just roll over and die.   There is a good probability that the Rays will need all hands on deck Thursday.  They won't be able to look forward to the Yankees if they are fighting for their life on Thursday.  

I'm expecting a really good game and the Astros will make the Ray's earn it.  If I had to bet, I would bet on the Astros.",baseball
"This lacks context. If the umps blow a call with two outs and the bases empty to walk the guy in front of the pitcher it sucks but isn't catastrophic.

If the ump blows a call and puts a runner on base right before a guy hits a home run that is a much bigger deal. 

Who cares if the ump blew a few calls in Washington's favor after completely giving the game to Houston? 

The key calls were the ones that killed the rallies in the 2nd and 7th inning as well as the one that put a runner on right before the second home run.",baseball
"lol no.

It actually baffles me how childish people are. Every single season since pitch tracking technology has been invented the umpire's have improved. The only reason people think it's bad is because they have every single ""bad"" call shoved down their throats by technology so they can't avoid it by not knowing better, drinking their beer, talking to their friends and shoving hamburgers into their face.

The K-zone on every broadcast has massively reduced people's enjoyment of the game and MLB will have to go to robo umps soon as a result.",baseball

"New mince was gonna have a quality AB, and he delivered. As for Cody B, he continues to be an overated player who never delivers in the post season. I'm not a dodger fan, but Im a baseball purist, and this guy is just NOT the guy. I bet his locker is right next to CK's.",baseball

And 2Ks baseball games were notoriously horrible, hence part of the reason why they stopped making them even though they had an effective monopoly on Microsoft/Nintendo consoles and could still sell their game on Sony consoles too as an (awful) alternative, and they STILL stopped making them.

"The Nats getting to Cole is pretty big deal.  Verlander has looked more vulnerable of the two headed monster.

I thought the Astros had the starting pitching matchup advantage as Cole &gt; Scherzer

However for game 2, I think Strasburg has impressed me more than Verlander in the post season so far. I actually think for tomorrow the Nats have the starting pitching matchup advantage.

They could do it. Going over LT next year or right at it. Then after 2020 have a lot coming off the books with Reddick(14M). Brantley(16M). Then after ‘21 have JV and Greinke coming off at around 60M. Just depends how they want to go with Springer and Correa in a few years. But if they set their sights on just locking up Cole this offseason they absolutely could.,baseball
"Yeah, but those players turning down the Angels happened *before* the Angels extended Trout late in the offseason (after Harper signed). 

Before Trout was extended, he was 2 years away from FA. A team with weak starting pitching (even before Skaggs' death), not an elite offense, a not very strong farm system (the farm took big strides forward this season), and their superstar franchise player 2 years away from FA gives off the vibe of ""if things go south this season, the Angels might trade Trout and I'd be stuck on a team that'll be rebuilding for the duration of my contract."" When you've got a comparable offer from say, the Nats or another contender, I could see why an FA might turn LA down. 

But the extension signified that Trout is going absolutely nowhere anytime soon.  That changes how the Angels appear to a FA .",baseball
Our best pitcher Soroka should have pitched game 1 or 2 so we could use him away game 4 or potentially game 5. Waiting to pitch him made no sense since he’s our best guy he far but our bats failed us and very disappointed in Freddie freeman tbh soroka pitching 1 game was a bad move that cost us too imo,baseball

The rule states plainly that a runner is out for running outside the two lines only if by doing so interferes with the play. Turner was touching the bag as the glove hits him. The bag of course is to the left of the foul line, and since the exact same thing would have happened if Turner had come to the left of the foul line only to touch the bag, there is no reasonable interpretation that his route caused interference.",baseball

"People meme the Astros and say they can fix any pitcher, but what they did to guys like Cole is unreal.  I think it’s unfair to count his pirates years because clearly the Astros found something the pirates couldn’t.  Since coming to the Astros Cole has been much better than strasburg.  

I don’t think calling a guy who has had 2 great seasons after switching teams is recency bias.

If this came out of nowhere then maybe, but it’s clear Cole figured something out after coming to the Astros.

Strasburg is great, and has been his whole career, but Cole is definitely better than him right now.

I agree with your point in general, I said it was unfair to call degrom better than Scherzer after one outlier year (now I wouldn’t argue it but this year showed they’re pretty similar), but Cole’s peripherals and results have been great the last 2 years, I don’t think this is a fluke.",baseball

"Correct. He was amazing in 2013 and somehow is pitching even better now with the Nats.

They were a very well balanced team. Great offense, great SP. They had three consecutive MVPs (Verlander, Cabera x2) and Victor Martinez fell short of making it four straight (he finished 2nd behind Trout). 2014 was when they unlocked JD Martinez's potential after the Astros released him during spring training. They went to three straight ALCS' from 2011-2013, and reached the WS in 2012. They were really good. 

But their bullpen was always abysmal, and was reason number one for why those Tigers teams never won it all. They were extremely talented, but showed everyone why you shouldn't neglect the bullpen.",baseball
The rest that the Nationals have now is big - they have almost a week off to rest their starters and will likely be able to use them aggressively in relief again like they did against the Dodgers. I think they match up better against the Yankees but they have a real chance against either team.,baseball
"Runner started running before contact. Either hit/run or a straight steal attempt. Couldn't see where the ball was hit to.

So the Simmons and Pennington pretended that it was a routine ground ball and that they were turning 2. Confused the runner enough to give Trout time to throw it to first base for the out.",baseball
"Yadier Molina will get Ozzie Smith treatment. His defensive numbers are superior for his generation and stats of Cardinals' pitching staff stand out during Yadi's career. Plus, only Mauer and Posey are up there with Yadi as best catchers of their generation. Currently, there's no catcher that stand out after their generation so Hall of Fame might go a long time without voting in another catcher after these three. Also, career legacy is very important and Yadier has the ""it"" factor for his defense and his leadership.",baseball
"I feel bad for him too.  As a Cards fan, it's fun to joke about him always choking in the playoffs, but he's still a human being and one of the greatest athletes of my generation.  

I was actually rooting for the Dodgers because of David Freese and Joe Kelly, but I didn't really care that much who won.",baseball
"The way I see it, if we win it's great for us, but if we lose it still means that the Nats—a team which until recently was where we used to be—is having their own 2017 moment, and I can't help but feel happy for them if that happens, as sad as it's gonna be for us.

"“Between games, (Willie) Mays came over to me and said, ‘Now, in the second game, you’re going up against Bob Gibson.’ I only half-listened to what he was saying, figuring it didn’t make much difference. So I walked up to the plate the first time and started digging a little hole with my back foot…No sooner did I start digging that hole than I hear Willie screaming from the dugout: ‘Noooooo!’ Well, the first pitch came inside. No harm done, though. So I dug in again. The next thing I knew, there was a loud crack and my left shoulder was broken. I should have listened to Willie.”

"Meh we’re good in everything except offense, where we’re bottom 10.  And even then our offensive woes are in no small part a factor of basically everyone having a career worst year around the same time.

"Of course I do. But they are an exception to the rule. They dominated every year for like 15 years. Just one WS, but running away with the divisions year after year. 

The Astros have literally been good for 3 years. If they are in the middle of a dynasty, you’d expect them to win the WS this year and then be dominate for another 3-4 years. If they don’t win the WS, then they’re 1/4 of the way through the Braves run (3 of 12 years of being dominant). 

Wake me up when the Astros maintain success for as long as the Braves did or win as many rings and dominate in a short amount of time as the late 90s Yankees did.",baseball

"i reiterate my comment from the game thread:

Outside of the interference debacle last night, the umpiring hasn't been that bad. The reason it feels like an umpire show is the hyper focus on balls and strikes with the zone overlay. If anything, this just demonstrates how important it is to fans to have consistent, high accuracy balls and strikes. So the robo ump revolution isn't a reaction to worsening umpiring, just a natural evolution as technology is becoming available.",baseball

"Great example. Interesting that Correa wasn’t ruled out here since it was more egregious and it definitely affected the throw. 

Tonight Turners path didn’t seem to affect the throw at all. It was just a bad throw. The fact that he got hit at the end would have been unavoidable whether he’d been running in the 45-ft lines or not. Nevertheless that was the judgment.",baseball
"Indian tag was just another way of saying throwing and hitting a runner was a legal out. We used to play with tennis balls and since there weren't enough people to cover all bases, you could throw and hit a runner off base to get them out.

They bitched about one thing because it started it and not about another because it was retaliation.

"You're not out because you aren't in the running lane.  You're out because of interference while not being in the running lane.  Altuve was further out of the line, but he didn't interfere with any fielders at all.  Not trying to be offensive, but you aren't understanding the running lane rule.  It's a subset of the interference rule.  It's interference if the runner interferes with the 1st baseman's attempt to field the ball, unless he's within his running lane with both feet, or exiting the running lane to step on the bag.",baseball
"&gt; It de-values what umpires do, even if they keep their jobs and nominally their wages are the same in the short term.

"You know what gets me?

Crane buys the team. Hires Luhnow. Tanks, rebuilds the farm system, raises some great home-grown talent, trades for more, buys a bit more, and builds this amazing juggernaut of talent around young studs like Correa, Bregman and Springer, and great old vets like Greinke and Verlander. They find a way to resurrect these high-spin-rate guys' careers, and turn good high-spin-rate guys into legends.

And the guy who sent us to the WS isn't any one of those. It's the guy nobody would give a chance to. The guy who showed up when we were bad and suffered through the years of being *even worse*. The guy whose home country is devouring itself in corruption and misery. The guy the scout lied about his height in order to give him a shot. The one guy who just somehow made himself better than all the analytics' mastery and proved himself to be the best player on the team.

"I personally hadn't heard anything about UNLV myself so I only have what others have to say about it hahaha.

I mean, I would love even more teams (the more baseball the better!) but 32 would be great. And i could see both Portland and Vegas myself, mostly so that we could hopefully get the two Texas teams out of the the West divisions. Those two teams are so damn far away from the rest of the teams. Pretty sure i had seen the Angels go from Seattle, to Texas, to Oakland before, which must suck ass for flights. They belong in the central division, like the Astros were before. And no I'm 100% totally unbiased about getting them the hell out of whatever division the Angels are in ��

I think that would be a neat division, but that would mean either the A's and Angels adapt to not having a DH or the Giants, Padres and Dodgers adapt the DH. Would be difficult to get any of them to do that I feel. Unless the NL itself ever adapts it fully. Though I hope not. I like the AL with the DH and the NL without.

"I still do not understand why you think i am arguing against Bumgarner.

Clutch does not exist.

Bumgarner is the player that everyone who believes in clutch would say he is a clutch player. In 3/4 of the years he was in the playoffs he pitched to the same stats as he had in the regular season.

That doesn't mean he is bad. It just shows he is not a player that would prove that clutch exists. He put up those stats in 2014 for reasons that had nothing to do with being clutch.

You're not even attempting to make an argument that clutch exists.",baseball

"I’m being very glass half-full in this thread and I do somewhat apologize for that— I simply wouldn’t be angry about the way Rockies ownership handles money. I mean maybe the way they’ve spent it and mistakes they may have made. But at the end of the day for how much revenue they bring in the Rockies have done a great job keeping their players around and spending money to make a team that can take the next step— again even erroneously. 

To get a comparison/contrast of what I’m talking about— Indians owner Larry Dolan has literally scoffed at the idea of keeping Francisco Lindor long term. The Indians— a team who’s OD OF had such stud names as Tyler Naquin and Leonys Martin— allowed an OF who was a career Indian and .300 hitter Michael Brantley walk. Not because he got a huge contract or had a ton of interest either (2/32). But because they’re asinine cheapskates. Teams like the Pirates literally never offer FA deals. So no— they haven’t bombed on giving Ian Desmond 70 Million— but at least they (COL) has taken some chances and been willing to spend the money. The largest FA deal in PIT history is Liriano (3/39) followed by Nova (3/24) and Russell Martin (2/17). That’s THREE contracts in team history above 16 Million TOTAL VALUE. 

Don’t get me wrong— Rockies have put them in the wrong place— but at least the Rockies have taken their balls out a few times the last few years and taken the chance at being a bit better. As a fan I think you have to still credit them for that. Fans like those of the Indians (at least those who defend the concept of what is “affordable” ) and FOs like those in the Indians FO have proven what you can actually get away with in Baseball payroll wise without a huge boycott or massive fan outrage. At least the Rockies are TRYING significantly harder than the rest of these team... and I think that has to count for something... right? I mean better give Arenado a player opt than turn your nose at signing him entirely. 

And just to dispel this rumor if anyone believes this and actually reads this diatribe— via Forbes the Indians and Rockies have two of the most comparable revenue figures both last year and in the last several years. The Rockies took a team with a nucleus and tried to pay more (up to 11th in Payroll) to make it a competitor. The Indians took a WS finalist who was I believe up 3-2 to the Cubs and refused to pay even their own players to just retain what they had like Brantley, and with comparable revenues have slipped to the 19th highest payroll entering this year.

So yes very glass half full but at the end of the day it’s what I truly believe. Rockies FO deserves flack but they deserve credit as well. At least they’ve shown the willingness to write checks and keep important home grown players which isn’t consistent with more than just the teams in the examples I just brought up",baseball

Baseball, unlike other sports, doesn’t have straight seeding, so a team can be technically the last seed (according to your criteria) because of the wild card but still have the second best record in the league.

Fielders are taught to throw to the inside of the bag on these plays. The throw was to the outside of the bag. The Astros made an error, and the Nats were punished severely for it. The situation went from 2nd and 3rd with 0 outs to runner on 1st with 1 out.",baseball

&gt;This is the miscalculation that teams make over and over again. They acquire players with reprehensible pasts for less than market rate and concede that they will have to pay a price in public trust. But when the bill comes due, teams act like they, not the people their actions wounded, are the aggrieved party. *How dare you keep reminding us of the past? Don’t you understand we have baseball games to play?*

They make the calculation to go after profits or wins, and to sacrifice PR and their morals.

"Sanchez has had just as much rest now as he did before his outing against the Dodgers, who are also really good hitters who know how to work a count. He went 5 innings on 1 run/4 hits although his pitch count was ugly. The Nats would go on to lose that game via bullpen meltdown.

I'm not worried about Sanchez being rusty or the Astros murdering him; what happens after he leaves the game is another story.

That said... Bregman seems to be his own worst enemy right now, and Greinke has not been great in the post season in general, so I could see this being a total slug fest and a wild roller coaster ride.",baseball

Am I in the minority in thinking robo-umps are going to result in a large advantage for pitchers?

"Back in college, one of the fraternities pooled their money and made a huge sports wager on a football game. Something like $20,000 total. The night before the game, they had three or four ""agents"" rent hotel rooms in the same hotel as the visiting team, and took turns setting off the fire alarm all night. It ended up working, and their team won the next day.

I'm surprised shit like that doesn't happen more often.",baseball
"We can all agree there, but you also have to look at the context of missed calls. If you get robbed of a third strike and then a guy hits a 2 hr homer on the next pitch, that’s an impactful call. Should you still shoulder blame for giving up the home run? Of course...

But then on the opposite side, when you have guys on base and a full count, and you take a pitch that is high and outside and they call it strike 3 to end the inning, that’s a a huge momentum swing. How many times have both teams tacked on runs with 2 outs or 2 strikes? When you give one team extra chances to do damage and take deserved chances away from the other team, it’s a lot to overcome. 

The Astros and Cole are already good enough, they don’t need help. Extending an inning for one team while cutting another’s short sucks, and giving one pitcher a generous zone while not affording Ross the same luxury has a domino effect beyond just a couple of pitches. 

Ultimately you tip your cap to the Astros because they capitalized on their extra chances and we haven’t done that since Game 2, but the poor officiating is an unfortunate sidebar.",baseball

"He’s not on the edge of the lane, both feet must be in the lane to be considered in the lane as a runner. 

[Here’s](https://www.google.com/amp/s/ftw.usatoday.com/2019/10/nationals-interference-call/amp) a webpage with a link to a tweet. The tweet has a video that’s shows the side view, from which you should be able to pretty clearly see he hit the glove before his left foot hit the bag. If you hit the glove before the catch is made, you have interfered with the throw. 

Once again, he is not protected because at no point was he inside the runners lane. There is no ‘almost’ or ‘close enough.’ You are allowed to exit the lane for one step to reach for the bag. However, if you did not enter the lane you cannot exit it. 

Think of it like out of bounds in basketball. You are in bounds until you step out. This is why it’s ok for runners to ‘take one step out of the lane,’ because that step should land on the base, so there is no time in between when the runner is ‘in the lane’ and ‘touching the base’. However, in this play, Turner is not considered ‘in the lane’ when he hits the glove and thus gets no protections.",baseball
It hit him square in the palm and he just dropped it.  I don't care about who does or doesn't get to it.  Not everyone makes the play but 99 out of 100 who get into that same position can close their glove on the ball and make the catch.,baseball

It's much easier to defend the decision to use Kershaw than it was to defend the decision to pull Greinke. Greinke was absolutely dealing, and his pitch count was low enough that he could have conceivably pitched a complete game.",baseball
"Scherzer is far better than Greinke, and the Nats had a really weak bullpen. Totally unfair comparison imo. And really, you trust Greinke more than *any* reliever?

The runner is required to run between the foul line and that line 3 feet to the right of the foul line that runs for the last 45 feet to the base.

If he's not in that lane and gets hit with a thrown ball, or interferes with a fielder outside of that lane trying to make a play, he should be called out. That's what happened on this play. Turner never ran in foul territory and got in the way of Gurriel trying to make a play.

"The post's statement is about as misleading as you can get. As you mentioned, the only way to 'advance in the postseason' before 1969 was to win the WS as there was a single round of the playoffs. The Senators 2.0 moved to Texas in 1971, so they had 3 seasons to advance in the new fangled rounds system. And then they had no team until 2005. So its really like 20 seasons of not advancing in the post season and 45 years of not winning the WS in years where there was only one round.",baseball
"As a Nats fan, I'm kind of tired of the Bryce talk of any sort.  I'm sure he'd rather be playing than watching, but as the vast majority of MLB players are watching right now, there's no reason to think he wants the Nats to lose just because he doesn't play here anymore.

The narrative that we've come this far *because* Hooper left is a little far-fetched (aside from the fact that we likely wouldn't have signed Corbin).  Though if we'd given him the contract he wanted, there's no chance we'd even be in the running for Rendon.  While certainly not a sure thing that he re-signs, I think he has been a much more consistent contributor this year -- both in the regular season and the playoffs -- than Harper would have been, at least based on past performance.  

I wish him as well as I wish the Phillies.  Which is unfortunate for Bryce, but it's nothing personal.",baseball

"&gt; So we need to change any team tradition that anyone could possibly find offensive. Got it. No fucking way that could ever get out of hand, right?

Holy shit are your arguments predictable. No where did I say that.

We had someone say the tradition was a bit offensive and state his reason, the Braves agreed and made a change that takes little effort on their part or anyones elses part for that matter. If further situations like that happen where someone gives a good reason why something is offensive and the team in question agrees then that's cool to. Especially when it takes minimal effort for them to change and no one really loses anything important.

This the sky is falling attitude from people like you everytime a topic like this comes up has gotten boring to me. No the entire english dictionary won't be banned for being offensive to someone. Some things will become less socially acceptable to do/say as people start to actually care about more races/ethnic groups, sexual preferences, religions, etc than just their own.

"I’m having trouble finding it now (I’m on mobile) but the Yankees preseason WAR projection didn’t drop off very much at all if you re-calculated it while assigning the actual number of appearances each player had.

"I've said this elsewhere in this thread, but I guess it bears repeating.

Fowler tried to go first to third *because Markakis wasn't getting the ball in quickly.* If Markakis had charged hard and made a quick throw, Fowler would've just stayed at second. You can see Fowler slow down and look to RF before he gets to second -- he's timing it up and seeing if he can bait Markakis into making a casual play. If Markakis had charged and thrown quickly, Fowler would've just stayed at second.

And if Fowler had stayed at second, literally nothing would've changed. Goldschmidt drew a walk next to load the bases. From that point on, nothing is affected by Fowler going first to third or staying at second.

The Acuna play had a tangible impact, since the inning ended when he was doubled up at second base. *That* is why the Acuna play is getting more attention than the Markakis play -- because it literally mattered more.",baseball

Furthermore, while the Dodgers have been the most talented team in their league over the last few years, the Yankees had to deal with the superteam Astros, 108-win Red Sox, and (earlier in the decade) those stacked Tigers teams.

Joe Ross is highly unlikely to put up an Urquidy-like performance. Especially on late ""Ay Joe, as of this morning scherzer can't pitch, you're up"" notice.

Ross doesn't have the stuff and hot streak that Urquidy has. Urquidy had never pitched against the Nats before last night. He's only pitched against 7 teams as a rookie, so that can be tough when a club like the Nats has never faced a pitcher.

Same goes for Joe Ross though. He's never pitched against the Astros since coming into the league in 2015.

Will be really interesting to see if Scherzer can go for a game 7. Or will he be a reliever in both game 6 and 7 if his body is able?

I had a feeling that Urquidy would dominate the Nats, but yeah the Nats did have a decent amount of hard hit balls. please wake back up nats.

"Most of the time when a player swings at a ball or takes a strike three, it's because he misread (or just flat out didnt get any read) on the spin of the ball coming out of the pitcher's hand. Batting is actually a lot like stopping PKs in soccer. The players don't have enough time to watch the flight of the ball and then swing so normally they have a predetermined spot they want to go to and then try and read what the pitcher is doing in his windup and release. If you misread the ball out of the pitcher's hand it will make your swing look bad.",baseball

"The Devil went down to Georgia. He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause the series was tied. He was willing to make a deal

When he came across this young man swingin’ on a bat and playin' it hot, and the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said ""Boy, let me tell you what.""


""I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a baseball player, too,
and if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you. Now you play a pretty good ball, boy, but give the Devil his due. I'll bet an NLDS against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you.""

The boy said, ""My name's Freddie, and it might be a sin.
But I'll take your bet, and you're gonna regret, 'cause I'm the best there's ever been.""

Freddie, rosin up your bow and play your batting hard
'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals his Cards. And if you win you get this shiny pennant made of gold, but if you lose the devil gets your soul

The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show.""

And fire flew from his dugout as he rosined up his bat.
And he swung the bat across the zone and it made an evil hiss.

And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this:

"Yes, all of this. 

I get that people love when the Yankees fail, but let's consider that the standard for what constitutes failure for them is measured by World Series Championships vs No World Series Championships (which admittedly is the standard they have set for themselves), and/or how many years have passed since their last ring. Think about that. There are only a handful of other franchises that can seriously consider measuring success that way.
That's not to say that they haven't spent a lot; they have. But by most standards (except for their own, self-imposed expectations), it has paid off well. 
Also, this ""10 year drought"" idea seems disingenuous; they have had longer streaks without a World Series appearance (most of my childhood coincided with the 1982-1995 drought; I was 20 in 1996 when I first tasted World Series success as a Yankee fan). The difference here is that this one happens to fall within the same decade, which feels...trivial.",baseball

"Sure, but its not a question of what value can it add, it is a question of what value can it take away when it fails. If you fail too often (which doesn't mean simply more than you succeed), you can lose that value. I don't think with a lineup like the Astros have, that stealing as the 3 or 4 guy makes much sense, so I don't want to take away value for that reason as it wouldn't be that valuable an addition. Not sure the calculus is the same for the Angels though.",baseball

I totally get where you're coming from - you see a thing without any racial connotation whatsoever, and later you come to find out it may have had certain historical overtones. But that wasn't what you meant at all and that shouldn't make you a racist, right?

But ask yourself, why does a team called the ""Braves"" do a chant like that, accompanied by that motion? Certainly it has some origin, certainly must mean *something*. In an league where every MLB team is more and more like a McDonald's franchise, with PA riffs and cheers spreading from ballpark to ballpark, why haven't other fanbases picked up on this chant?

I think it represents genuine progress that you've been able to grow up in a world where those stereotypes have no meaning, they don't even register. But think about what exactly is going on when a predominantly white group emulates a weapon that was invented by Native Americans - peoples who were literally decimated by some estimates, and yet *they* were the ones painted as violent ""savages"" - with a chant evocative of often villainous Hollywood depictions of those peoples, to cheer on a team named after their supposedly ""[noble](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Noble_savage)"" qualities as warriors (as if American Indians aren't just people just like anybody else, even leaving differences between particular tribes aside for a moment).

"From second base, it’s harder for the pitcher to pick off or the middle infield to hold the runner. This lets the base runner get a larger lead and be closer to third base.

1c-b(1). Like, if you're about to pitch and then don't pitch, you have to still pitch. You cannot not pitch. Does that make any sense?

1c-b(2). You gotta be, throwing motion of the ball, and then, until you just throw it.

1c-b(2)-a. Okay, well, you can have the ball up here, like this, but then there's the balk you gotta think about.

If he can't tell, he'll point down the line for the call. If he doesn't but the catcher thinks the bat went around, the catcher will point down to ask for the call, at which point the umpire will basically always point down for it.",baseball

That’s where I got my 20% number came from. Elsewhere in this article they say that there’s about 14 missed calls per game, which certainly contradicts the 20% number as there are about 140 pitches in a game. Maybe they meant to write 10% and it’s a typo? I’m genuinely unsure.

Looking at it more, there’s a table on that page that says the worst ump is in the 14-15% range, so the 20% number is definitely wrong. I’ll amend my comment.",baseball

The Cardinals honestly didn't play badly at all in Games 1 and 2. Those were pitchers' duels that could have gone either way. But for some reason they just seemed to totally collapse as soon as the series shifted over to DC. 

Not a bad turnaround at all for the Redbirds to get to the NLCS in a year that their playoff odds were tough with a dogfight in the NL Central, and they seemed to turn the corner.

"  Tonights 3rd inning Washington and LA was a perfect example of what I was saying.   Scherzer comes up with one on and one out or maybe none out.  Forget exactly.    He goes up to bat and makes 3 very lame attempts to bunt and then goes and sits down.    Where is the strategy in that?   I would rather see someone in that position who advances the game.   
   I understand what you are saying but I prefer someone in that position who can advance the game.   Some of these pitchers have not hit since high school when they get to the bigs.  In fact most of them.   Then they go up to bat against someone throwing a 95 mph fastball followed by a 85 mph slider then a 78 mph curve.   And they do this maybe 2 or 3 times a week.     They will never get better.     Pitchers used to take batting practice.  They don't even do that anymore unless it is AL pitchers going into a playoff game where they will practice bunting.  Maybe.  They all can hit, or could.  Usually in little league the pitcher is one of the best hitters as well.  Or in my experience it was.  
   A weak spot in the lineup ok, but an automatic out in the lineup is more likely when the pitcher comes up.  Your team is up to bat. 0-0.  Bases loaded 2 out second inning.  pitchers spot up.   Your pitcher is hitting 110.   I would rather see the DH.    
   Hey, I understand what you are saying.  It does change the game when the manager has to make those hard decisions.   The real question is, does it improve it.    I don't think it does.  
    I like in the AL where there are almost no weak spots in the lineup.   Other than the strategy I don't think it adds to the game to have an almost automatic out come up to bat.   
   Eventually the DH will come to the NL as well.    That is now pretty much the only league left with pitchers hitting.",baseball

"Since I took the time to write this on my damn phone just to have the thread deleted I'll copy it here:

""Since the throw didn't come up the line, where running where he did would obstruct the fielder's view, the only point at which interference could have taken place is at the point of collision between runner and first baseman. This being the case, the only point at which the runner's position on the base path is relevant is at that moment-- not the path he took to get there. It looks to me that, at that moment, he has his left foot dead center over the bag. Well within, in my judgement, a ""step, stride"" etc of the running lane and, thus, he is in a position to which he is by rule entitled.""

Not a expert or looking for a fight but always interested in hearing thoughts.

E: on second reading, (and I'm paraphrasing) the batter may *exit* the 3 foot lane by means of a step, stride, etc. Interesting. My question: is that a step-by-step instruction for what is allowed? E.g. first step w/in the 3 foot lane then stride out from it. Or, is this defining and area to which a runner is permitted? E.g. he is allowed, without fear of interference, the area of both the 3 foot lane and that area within one step/stride of the first in the direction of the bag. Do y'all know which or these, or some other, interpretation is preferred? 

Writing this on my phone has maxed my attention span for anything that is not beer so I'll take my answer off the air.",baseball

That said, the disdain for the Cardinals comes from talking about respect but displaying literally none of it... at all... ever. Hypocrites are the bane of human existence.

Now I've shown you that I can be self aware, meanwhile I don't expect the same from you, because I know enough Cardinals fans to know better.

How about Warren Spahn for the Braves? Jackie Robinson or Roy Campanella for the Dodgers? Should Giants fans care about Mel Ott or Christy Mathewson? Should Twins fans care about Walter Johnson?

That is a combination of circumstances where Hinch would be fully to blame if Cole came in and let the game get away. Hinch went down with the relievers who got the Astros here.

"Yeah, I actually agree that probably the *biggest* oopsie was not leaving Maeda in longer. I would have at least let him start the next inning and see how it went. After Kershaw got rocked, and with Maeda already gone, the options were severely limited. 

I also agree that letting Kelly start the 10th made sense. I still say he shoulda been pulled after the walk and double, though.",baseball
When Taylor caught the ball he literally looked like he didn’t know what to do. He had a look of “uhhh so I caught this...now what do I do with it..?” The idea of winning a postseason series was so foreign to Washington that the players didn’t know how to react lmao,baseball
"Wrong. Just because it didn't work out doesn't mean it was the wrong decision. Have you seen the Nats pen?

Sure, maybe he could've kept Sanchez in a bit longer but if you actually think the Nats would've held on to a 2-1 win without bringing in a starting pitcher caliber guy after Sanchez you're kidding yourself.",baseball
"It hasn't been commonsense in the sabr era. Sabr gospel says strikeouts are just another out. Like I said in the other exchange, strikeouts are the WORST out. 

Hitters like that don't grow on trees because they're taught a high k rate is fine as long as you hit homeruns. They are more than capable of adjusting. Cody Bellinger cut his k rate down to 16 percent this season.",baseball
"This ball was eleven seconds from contact to getting picked up by the catcher. Plenty of time for right to go stand by first and just be involved. And in those eleven seconds first could have covered behind the plate, seen the wonky throw, and been in position to back up and keep the runner on third.

Even my fat ass could get from right to where Zimmerman was doing nothing helpful in eleven seconds.",baseball
"I'd say so. Nationals playing Astros in the World Series—just a few years back the idea of even *one* of those teams being in the WS would be the punchline to a bad joke in and of itself!—plus every home team losing, the comeback and then ultimate loss of the Astros, the debacle of that call last night... yeah, this is gonna be one to remember.

Also, weirdly, it's featured Astros fans and Nationals fans generally getting along, yet the fans of every other team have been absolutely vitriolic throughout.",baseball
"Myhe yankees have two domestic abusers, so do the Phillies, Twins, a bunch of other teams too. Yeah, Yuli did something as nitty. But hea got the love of Houston, the most diverse city in the US. Hes not a bad dude. People make mistakes. Were still going to enjoy our baseball.",baseball
"I had the best timing for this game.

When I first turned it on I saw the game tying HR from Springer. Shortly after I watched a movie as I normally do on Sunday evenings.

Movie is over, decided to check the game. Turned it on for the James-Sanchez AB then the walk-off immediately after. That's some peak baseball watching efficiency right there.",baseball
"It’s more that the fielder is reaching to tag the runner at the hip and himself causing the interference look of knocking the glove. Fielder catches ball and doesn’t reach to tag, no interference. Turner beat the run so only play is to reach out a tag but hitting the hip knocked the glove loose.",baseball
"“The batter-runner is permitted to exit the three-foot lane by means of a step, stride, reach or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base for the sole purpose of touching the base.” Turner was nowhere he shouldn’t be. This is an objectively incorrect interpretation of the rule. He was allowed to be where he was.",baseball
"The only even remote case that could be made about that play was that turner was (on the slightest technicality of the rule) outside of the 3 foot base path. Now that we know it was because turner hit the glove, there’s no chance in hell that was even close to the correct call. 

Turner was deemed to be in the base path. Turner runs in the base path towards the base. The pitcher makes a garbage throw that causes the first basemen to put his glove into the base path. 

How is any of this Turner’s fault if he was deemed to be inside of the legal base path by the umpire crew?",baseball
"To honest, I wasn’t expecting the Nats to be this good. Can’t wait to see what happens in DC now? Can the Nats keep their winning ways or will the Astros win a game? We’ll see.

"Nah, the final score alone doesn’t tell you the full story. First of all I’d say a blowout is more like 6-7+ runs. 4 runs is just outside the range of a save situation. And secondly, the Nats won on a fucking grand slam in the 10th inning lol. That was the best game of the postseason so far and it probably won’t be topped",baseball
"People second guessing this are dumb. Kershaw shut the door on the Nats in 2016. He closed out the NLCS last year. He got Eaton tonight! 

He just got beat in the 8th. It happens. They are good hitters.

Kershaw has blown shit before - the fact that he blew Game 5 in 2017 is the low point of his career, in my opinion. But we didn't lose this series because of Clayton Kershaw. We lost because the Nats are good and our best hitters just didn't hit. We can't win a series just based on Muncy, Turner and the occassional other hit. Bellinger and Seagar didn't show up yet again. Can't win that way.",baseball
"If you burn Maeda Kelly and janson by the 10th in a tie game who pitches 11 or 12? I don’t mind Kelly going again, he’d only thrown like 10 pitches and they were great. What I mind is not pulling him in trouble in the 10th and not letting Maeda continue after he got out of his inning",baseball
"According to ESPN it went from 80.9 to 79.7 after the walk, although I’m not sure how good their win probability tool is. It also doesn’t account for the fact that they could have pitched Soto around the edge of the zone looking to induce weak contact or bad swings since they had a base open rather than just walking him for free.",baseball
"Brief History of the Nats (Reply to add to the timeline)

1994: Expos got robbed of their first playoff run in a long time  
2004: MLB bought the Expos and moved them to DC to become the Nationals  
2005: Ryan Zimmerman debuts for the Nationals  
2012: Nats make their postseason berth after the 94 lockdown  
2018: Bryce Harper leaves the Nats for their rivals, the 4th place Phillies  
2019: Came all the way back from a bad spring to clinch a wild card, and eventually win the World Series.

Now that is amazing!",baseball
"Bryce wasn't worth paying a fortune but let's make an offer of 300m anyway with a lot of deferred money. Hindsight is always 20/20 and Bryce wasn't the reason why you failed to win before.

It was your bullpen that failed inexplicably. Your GM tried and tried hard to fix that bullpen but it just didn't work. Sometimes things don't work, sometimes luck favors you. Gerardo Parra acquisition changed things for you in the clubhouse. That’s luck. If the rookie OF in Milwaukee didn't misplay the single, what are you saying then?

Stop thinking about Bryce and be happy that Max has a ring, Zimmerman (who has gone through a lot) has a ring and the second coming of Ted Williams has a ring unlike the original.",baseball
"I moved to DC in August of last year after growing up a Braves fan, decided to support the local team and have been lucky enough to go to ~10 games since then. I was there this year 4/27 against the Padres when we gave up 6 in the top of the 10th and things looked grim for the season. The next game I went to was 5/25 when Corbin pitched a CG shutout against the Marlins and they started the come back. Thank you Nats for a wonderful season to welcome me to the city!",baseball
"Hmm, I suppose that isn't a stupid-as-fuck thought process, but the bullpen did horrendously tonight. The second that Kendrick hit that two-run HR right off of the foul posts from that pitch by Harris, the tides turned, and the Nats tasted the Astros' fear. They feasted on it, and now they are the kings of the mountain.",baseball
"Is it still Hosmer, or has he sucked enough with the Padres that you can't consider him overrated?

Edit: I'll also go out on a limb and say Marcus Semien. His defense has improved significantly, but his season at the plate this year could be a career best that he never matches. Semien just turned 29, so we don't know if this offensive boost is sustainable in the short-run and for how long it will last if he can repeat 2019's results next season. Gotta wait and see like when Tommy Pham exploded out of nowhere with a borderline MVP-level season in '17.",baseball
"People talk about Mike Trout like he’ll be the greatest of all time, but he’s missed ~20-50 games each of the last three years. I hope he’s healthy and we get to see him great, but a big part of me thinks he’s just one big or chronic injury away from retirement or mediocrity.",baseball
"Generally top FA deals have no positive surplus value if the agent did their job. So what you are suggesting is just paying for prospects by creating surplus via eating some part of the contract.

You could just pay for prospects without taking the risk that your big free agent totally busts.",baseball
"Similar scenario to what you described happened during the 2004 playoffs: with men on base, A-Rod hits a dribbler up the first base line. The Red Sox pitcher fields the ball and attempts to tag A-Rod, who slaps the ball out of his glove. While the ball is loose, A-Rod gets to first base and the other runners advance. 

Umpires ruled interference and called A-Rod out and sent all other runners back to their original base.",baseball
"The rule doesn't state that you have to slide but it does say that if you do slide then you will never be in violation of the rule. It also states that if the runner lowers their shoulder or tries to push through the catcher with their hands or arms that would be considered deviating from their path to the plate and they would be called out under the new rule. So yes it is illegal to run over the catcher. The only times contact with the catcher would not be a violation is when the catcher is illegally blocking the plate without the ball, the catchers attempt to field the throw leads him into unavoidable contact with the runner, and when the contact comes after the runner has slid.",baseball
"This is an honest question--how is carrying the bat equal to walking, glaring, or bat flip?  I do see how all of those are showing off, but I don't see how carrying the bat is.  Is it just ANYTHING out of the ordinary is automatically assumed to be a show of cockiness?  Appreciate you trying to explain this.",baseball
"Yeah it's very confusing even to us, the swings are real with our team. The take is that everyone believes in this team, and they took so far than we ever dreamed of. I absolutely did not think we would sweep the Nats, but after that 2-0 fall, I had a feeling they would come back, and they came back bigger than anyone ever imagined.

That's what makes tomorrow very special yet nerve wrecking.",baseball
"He's been great in Houston for sure, but I think it's hard to argue against 2011 and 2012 being his career best years.  He led the league in ERA+ (172 and 161), innings pitched (251, 238.1), strikeouts (250, 239) both of those years, and in 2011 he also led the league in ERA (2.40; 2012 he had a 2.64 ERA) and WHIP (0.920; in 2012 he had a 1.057 WHIP).

Granted, he has put up career-best WHIP numbers each of the last two seasons with mid-2 ERAs, and also set a career high in ERA+ this year, but his rWAR is lower which I'm guessing has something to do with an adjustment for the quality of defense behind him.

Curiously, fWAR has 2009 as his best season, but I don't like fWAR as much for pitchers for this kind of thing because it's FIP-based.  I respect the effort to make the stat as context-neutral as possible, but at the same time when we're talking about best seasons I feel like actual run prevention is something that has to be taken into account.",baseball
"Why? How Judge ran could have gotten him to third or even home if the ball dropped, instead of just second. He gets to third, he scores on anything, even a passed ball. Cuts the lead in half in a desperate situation. HAVE to maximize that chance however and whenever possible.

I give him a break because it was such a great catch. If the ball drops, everyone praises his aggression.",baseball

"Because they're incapable of imagining they're wrong. 

They are convinced in the marrow of their bones that everything they say and think is 100% God's absolute and undeniable truth, so anyone who objects is just too weak/pathetic/worthless to hear the truth.

They honestly believe they aren't telling evil Satanic lies. They honestly believe everyone else knows that too, and is objecting because they're offended by the truth.

It's beyond their imagining that everyone else thinks they're telling comfortable, ego-coddling lies and is trying to get them to stop lying.",baseball
"You can exit the lane to get to the bag, but you have to be in the lane first. It is rarely called because most times the ball is caught by the 1B anyway, so no interference call is required. But it is definitely called at least a few times a season. It's not really obscure.",baseball
"Textbook case of a team that flew under the radar because it took them two months to put themselves together. Sometimes the best team doesn't win 110 games and make it look easy all year. But since June the Nats have been as good as any team in baseball.

Huge props to the Nats FO for making this happen. There are a few franchises in baseball that can pull easy talent out of thing air and have everything go right, and the Nats are not one of them. This roster is a testament to a team that knows what they have and bets on their guys when adversity strikes.",baseball
"San Diego is the correct answer. But as far as others, MAYBE Miami...they have some young pitching (Sandy Alcantara, Jordan Yamamoto, Sixto Sanchez) and some position players with upside coming up (Isan Diaz, JJ Bleday, Jazz Chisolm). 

It'll be an uphill battle in that division, but to me they seem way ahead of teams like Baltimore and Detroit, which are an insult to Major League Baseball.",baseball

"Very good nominations. The Sox were the weakest offense in the league and were going against a team that *still* holds the single-season wins record despite playing ten fewer games, the Braves were in last place on July 4th and going against a team that had won 3 of the last 4 Series (and swept them) and the Yankees outscored the Pirates 55 runs to 27 over the course of their Series.",baseball

If you're born and raised in Seattle, root for the Mariners. Join their sub. Make some memes and join the community. Learn about the history. Go fucking coach a little league team. Play catch with your friends under a street light at night. ugh, im rambling. Just go see the Mariners and do scorecard, listen to podcasts, read up on it and just enjoy.",baseball
"This whole situation has made me respect Cardinals fans a lot more. They keep the shit talking to a game level. The Yankees have more reason than anyone to talk shit and keep it just about the game, seeing as they’ve won the most, yet they take it way too far.",baseball
"As written, I believe, the call is correct. As you said Turner is out of the running lane and eventually contacts the fielder trying to make the play. With just those two things the umpire has the ability to enact this rule. If he runs in the running lane like he’s supposed to, the umpire cannot call interference. 

If people are saying this rule doesn’t apply they are incorrect. However the umpires judgement to enforce the rule can be questioned, but, judgement calls cannot be reviewed. 

In my opinion, I kinda like the call as Turner clearly did not run in the lane and was a part of a collision that ended up avoiding an out (awaiting Nats fans ‘he was already there!’.. ) and advancing runners... and for the chaos of it all. 

People can say they should change the rule so runners can run in a straight line but that’s problematic as bunts cause issues with a catchers throwing path. Or that judgement calls should be able to be reviewed. I actually think that’s the best idea, but good luck convincing the mlb of that.",baseball
"Torre looked and sounded 3 million years old. I have 0 confidence he spoke with 100% accuracy. Two reasons: where a player is in relationship to the lane is integral to an interference call. So it doesn’t make sense. Also, the nationals filed a protest and cited a specific rule. So either Torre misspoke, he didn’t fully understand what had happened, or everyone else got it wrong.",baseball
"I think Joe's position is an emeritus one - more a rep of the participants of the baseball world in the rules process. The statement from Joe actually concerns me a little bit because I wish the players &amp; managers would involve themselves more in the rules, and make more of an effort to understand them and if Joe Torree isn't even able to give a competent answer to something as simple as this I question how much work he's actually putting into this role. 

Because I would have been able to explain this call when I went through a week long Junior Umpire Training back when I was 17. It's really not complicated or controversial.",baseball
"&gt; I think a lot of the anger is that you almost never see this call get made in a regular game

I'm not so sure it's all that infrequent.  I posted [this](https://baseballrulesacademy.com/runners-lane-violations-all-over-mlb/) elsewhere, but it's one of the more common 'weird rules' to be invoked.  Definitely see it more than, say, an infield fly.

I can definitely see being upset at calling it inconsistently, though.  But it seemed like most people were saying the call was just plain wrong.",baseball

"I think they have the most advanced high speed camera system of all MLB teams that they use to evaluate pitching mechanics. I don't attribute their success to merely tanking. Plenty of teams have had a parade of high picks and hot prospects that never amounted to anything.

"Eh, it was a judgement call. Literally, it couldn’t be reviewed because it is termed a judgement call, rather than a call that has a strictly defined set of circumstances.

To boil it all down, the first baseman did what every first baseman should do when they know they won’t get the out normally, and stuck his hand out, hoping to get the interference call, and he did. It’s a gray area.",baseball
"It wasn’t correct. You left off the comment to the rule:

&gt;The batter-runner is permitted to exit the three- foot lane by means of a step, stride, reach or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base for the sole purpose of touching first base.

The supposed interference happened in the last step before reaching the base.  Turner was legally allowed to be there because he was there “for the sole purpose of touching first base.”  Some have argued that Turner wasn’t in the three-foot lane before that so doesn’t get the benefit of this rule, but the interference depends on where you *are* when the interference happens, not where you *were*  before the interference.",baseball

"&gt;Like do you expect the catcher to pull the ball out of the strike zone or just have his hand perfectly still?

By rule it doesn't matter what the catcher does with his hand.

What we have now is a situation where catchers have trained umpires to take catcher positioning into account, and umpires reward catchers who do. And it results in inconsistent strike zones (how often do you hear people talk about pitchers and catchers ""earning"" the corners, or particular pitches), and the ever popular middle-middle ball call.

"*SIGH*. Let's try to reset this conversation. I will ignore the slight.

Umpires contend with a lot of moving elements to every pitch, including where the ball broke the plane, catcher movement, batter stance movement, and ball flight. They must judge every pitch. They make errors. Even the best have an error rate of seven percent or so.

We know that this error rate exists from the charting of balls and strikes, but also by the fact that catchers enjoy different rates of success of influencing strike calls by how they frame pitches. This speaks to their skill in influencing how the path of ball is perceived by the umpire.

Computer-assisted strike zones were tested during the Arizona Fall League. The results were promising, but indicated that it has issues with breaking pitches in certain parts of the zone.  I would expect that these issues will be resolved over time.

But it does point out that even with cameras, computers and vision systems, it's never going to be 100 percent accurate. It **will** be more accurate than human umpires, and perhaps to the point of fans here, much more consistent. This is encouraging. Even if you know the system has issues with high breaking balls, the batter, pitcher and catcher posses that knowledge.

So far, I think we are in agreement. 

We can also agree on these three facts:

* That there are more strikeouts, per 27 outs, than at any time in baseball history.
* That there are more home runs, per game, than at any time in baseball history.
* As a consequence, there are fewer balls but into play per game.

From 1980 to 2019 (40 seasons), the rate of balls in play has dropped from 76.9 percent to 63.7 percent. The rate has declined significantly in recent years, dropping by five percent since 2014.

Batters are failing to make contact at the highest rate ever - and exacerbating this situation by chasing balls out of the zone at the highest rate since they began recording this stat. Why? Hard throwing pitchers. More specialty relievers. Batters swinging for the fences.

Because there are fewer balls put into play and more strikeouts than at any time in baseball history, we've created a situation where the ball and strike calls by the home plate umpire have greater influence than ever on the outcome of at-bats and games. 

Thus, the perceived increase in bad calls is a function of the change in the game. We notice it more than ever because we see more at-bats resolved - or at least greatly influenced by - umpire decisions rather than the ground ball to third or fly ball to right.

We've all seen our share of poorly called games - Eric Greg's really wide strike zone in the 1997 NLCS is a great example. I might prefer to keep the human element, but there is no doubt technology will make for more consistent results.

Andruw Jones was obviously great at his peak but I don't think this really accounts for his decline well, and a guy with a 44.9 WAR, a .253 average, and 354 HRs is ranked several spots ahead of Lance Berkman who had a 53.6 WAR, .294 AVG, and 362 HRs, as well as a longer period of success. I'd personally also have Beltre and several others with more longevity ahead of Jones. Jim Edmonds was really consistent defensively but inconsistent offensively and is ranked ahead of teammate Scott Rolen, who had better batting numbers in the century and also was a great defender. MadBum ahead of Carpenter seems really weird at the time. Already having David Price ahead of Roger Clemens feels weird. Konerko had some great moments but his placement ahead of Johnny Damon, Matt Holliday, Magglio Ordonez, Victor Martinez, Troy Tulowitzki, and Derrick Lee, all of whom had significantly higher WARs even at the time, feels really weird.",baseball
"I have an old Twins hat that I got like 15 years ago because my grandma was a fan. Hasn't seen a whole lot of action over the years, but I put it on and like 10 seconds later Cruz hit that homer. Guess I have to keep it on until November.",baseball
"...I don't know if I've ever seen a baseball team start a game with such an obvious gameplan.

"Everyone hates us (Yankees fans) so do yourself a favor and pick someone else lol. I recommend the Braves or Twins if you want a team who’s in the playoffs this year. If you don’t care, the White Sox could be a fun team to follow if they make the correct moves this offseason",baseball
"Sweet, let me give this a try.

**Area where Feelings were Hurt:** r/NFL

**What Mean Stuff Said:** The Browns suck and our quarterback is terrible and the real Browns play in Baltimore and we're the worst team in football and our front office is trash and our owner is the worst one not named Dan Snyder and our GM is an idiot and OBJ is a diva and a bitch and Jarvis Landry is overpayed and we're overrated and everybody hates us and our coach is fat and incompetent and our DC is incompetent and our offense is garbage and we should've kept Gregg Williams and we'll always suck and our lake is green and Browns fans are the worst fanbase and we deserve every bad thing that ever happened to us and we'll never have a winning season

"I was wondering before the playoffs started: what would have happened to all the media outlets if the Rays/Twins and Nationals/Brewers faced off in the WS.

"Or... you could just let the young franchise grow. The franchise started in a place that is full of northern retirees who don't change their allegiance and sucked booty cakes for it's first 10 years of existence. The kids who were growing up when the Rays became watchable are most likely just now starting to become old enough to start buying their own tickets and maybe starting their own families. Making generations of fans takes a good bit of time. Especially in an area that's, once again, full of retirees who stay loyal to their teams.",baseball
"Saying nothing is not a viable answer in this situation because it means the media gets to write the entire narrative. 

If the Astros want to get out of this jam the cheap solution is to go to another media outlet and explain the facts. Journalists want to report the news, not be the news so it’s key to develop a neutral party. 

The expensive but risky strategy is for Crane to clean house but he won’t do that to a championship caliber team and he is implicated in this as well.",baseball
"These fucking umpires never give Yordan an accurate zone. I am starting to get why Yankee fans get so salty over Judge.

2 inches low? Tough shit. Three inches high? Also a strike. Been that way since he was called up which is crazy since typically guys with that good of an on base % get some respect on the borderline stuff",baseball

"This is something I actually get for the Old School Unwritten Rules^^TM camp. Taking forever to get in the box is annoying as fuck. Same for pitchers who take forever. 

But if Verlander or Scherzer want to take a while on some ABs or whatever, I'm fine with it.

Still a loooong way to go.  Bullpen games are tricky cause most of these guys not used to pitching multiple innings and having to keep coming back out of the dugout.  Would not be surprised if this game gets blown open at some point and we see like 15 runs between the 2 teams lol,baseball
"I agree. I’m just trying to show it wasn’t a full 50,000 fans booing stanton. Dude had one of the better game 1s so it wouldn’t even make sense. Maybe a couple of dumb people near the reporter who first posted it, but I’m just trying to show not *all* yankees fans are assholes.",baseball
"Okay, but they play a double header every day right? Like they face Cleveland at noon, next game starts around... 2:30. If they’re late they forfeit which is a loss. Then we get em the next day, same deal. Also no pitching changes allowed and the Astros have to wear ice skates",baseball
"I honestly think it’s the nature of the team right now. Altuve is the face of the club, and he’s all kindness and smiles and true, genuine love for the game. If say, someone like Bregman was the lead man, I think the temperament would be a bit different. But even so, most of the Astros themselves adhere to a certain level of respect while maintaining their likable personalities.",baseball
"I have a coworker who claims to loooove football, always says he watches it, and then when he talks fantasy he doesn’t know ANYONE.

"Texas Live! looks virtually identical to Ballpark Village in St. Louis. Same developer, many of the same tenants, and an almost indistinguishable design of the building itself. I think the verdict is kind of out on whether it has provided any return. On the one hand, Ballpark Village is usually busy. On the other hand, most of the business seems to have come at the expense of Washington Avenue, which used to be the downtown entertainment spot but is now much slower. They're building a ""Phase Two"" right now, with office space, luxury condos and a hotel. But even that might kind of be neutral. The main office tenant is just moving from across the street, and we already have a glut of vacant housing downtown. 

All that said, it could be a completely different story in a metro area that's growing.",baseball
"He doesn't seem to realize he's lucky *yet again* because the team sided with him by firing Taubman. JFC.

I'm glad Osuna had to stay away from his victim and their child for a year, but it disturbs me to think nothing is stopping him now. Hitting your girlfriend while she's holding your 3 year old ""sucks,"" dude. Not people talking about it.",baseball
"If Houston wins this one, with the Nats not scoring a run, it will be a 6 game series. Think about how deflating. You beat the two aces then lost, somewhat badly too their 3 starter and Johnny Wholestaff. Cole is going to dominate tomorrow, then Ver back at home. He won’t lose again.",baseball
"I think people shitting on Corbin are both 

A). underselling how incredibly wild and inconsistent that strike zone was for that entire inning


B). Do not understand how much an inconsistent strike zone fucks with a pitchers control




Like if the ump wants to call a low zone, or a wide zone, that's fine, pitchers can adjust. But in that inning alone we saw pitches all over the place seemingly randomly determined to be a strikes and balls.


This bothers me a shit ton in the post-season where an ump having even an off half-inning can cost a team dearly.",baseball
"I don't know if I feel this more strongly because I've done work commentating, but I'm just completely and utterly blown away that the colour commentators feel that their dipshit personal stories are more interesting than a game 5 elimination game that is happening *as they speak*.

It takes a breathtaking level of ego to believe that the viewers would rather hear about this shit than the game that they are ignoring.

Just baffling.",baseball
"First base is involved in almost every play, and you’ll see them bail out bad throws a lot. The least amount of hits go to the second baseman, and those that do are often routine grounders or line drives. An argument could also be made for right field though, I’ll agree. But you usually see a lot of athletes in right field who can also play center and left. So I would say while it may be around the same difficulty as second base, you’ll usually put a slightly less versatile athlete at second.",baseball
"&gt; However, being a fairly novel plural form, it is seldom used; the plurals platypuses, platypus, or, more rarely, platypi are more common.

"New York is literally suing him. NYC hates him after all the crap he's said. Especially the shit he pulled after 9/11

Just pathetic",baseball
Hats off to Ozuna. Goldy and him carried through the first four games. We would have been better served just walking them every at bat. I would have preferred challenging him up in the zone with a 4 seamer there because he’s handled the off speed so well recently. Ozuna crowds the plate making that low and away easier to handle. Excellent series by the two of them.,baseball
"This is a ""bullpen game"" for both teams. So they are both using relievers and bullpen guys to play the entire game. 

Typically the Yankees rely pretty heavily on their bullpen anyway and their bullpen is a real strength for the team, while the Astros have a couple of long haul type starters in Verlander and Cole that can go 7+ innings fairly regularly.",baseball
"i loved baseball as a kid, i use to listen to games on the radio and would watch whenever they had games on a local affiliate. i would go to some games too. but i don't follow or watch it anymore until the playoffs. been that way for about 10 years now. i just don't have the desire or patience to watch regular season games.

i'm a huge football fan but it feels like i've hit a wall with it this year in both CFB and NFL. CFB has become so predictable with the same 4 to 8 teams having any kind of chance to win the title. i use to be excited to watch any CFB game regardless of matchup, but now there's really only 2 or maybe 3 games each week worth paying attention to. as for the NFL, the product just sucks so much. endless flags and stupid new rules that are always been implemented combined with constantly complaining players. worst of all, it feels like 80% of the league is tanking which i guess they should be since the teams are getting worse each year. i've never remembered a time when the quality of play in the NFL has been this bad. i'm not sure if it has to do with less kids playing football now, but the current players just aren't good.

i guess my favorite sport has become the NBA which i always liked as a kid as well. it's the easiest to follow over a season and there's always fresh angles and naratives being told and analyzed. even if most of them are manufactured by the league and its talking heads, it still works well.

thanks to anyone who read this and wants to add their thoughts. i just felt like putting this down in writing i guess.",baseball
"The thing to remember about the defensive shift, is that it’s not some monolithic single shift. It should be thought of as one of many defensive shifts. Each batter has a hit probability spray chart that each organization keeps track of. So your team will basically study each batter in the opposing team before each game, and arrange themselves to where they think that batter will hit the ball. For example, a pull heavy lefty batter will most likely hit it on the right side of the field. So you’ll have the first, second, third basemen/shortstop, right fielder, and center fielder standing between first and second, leaving most of left field vacant. Generally speaking, the shift hurts lefties more than righties because it’s easier to throw to first base from right field than from left field (which is where a righty will most likely hit to).",baseball
"Interesting discussion. My initial two thoughts are, the playoff baseballs are manufactured separately than regular season balls (per the tweets). If made at the same time, the playoff baseball have been sitting in storage for months which could affect their properties.

Most importantly, which would address my first thought, what's the difference between regular season and post season baseballs over the years? Can they do the same calculations over the last 3-5-10 years? If so, it'd go a long way in helping us draw conclusions on this post season to see if this is normal or an anomaly.",baseball
"And what about people who overtly share their own (different) political views? Like wearing a DV awareness bracelet, helping out with charities that assist refugee/immigrant families, or refusing to go the WH after you win the WS?

What about people who are appropriately sharing their views and values - how can they trust to ever be judged solely by their on-field performance by this guy? How can the MLB or Ump Union ever make a straight-faced argument that he’s impartial?",baseball

Fuck Joe Buck and his historic moment ruining monotone bullshit.",baseball
"I don’t think the results take away from the point.  Even less of a chance they score if a pitcher was hitting.  And to disregard the outcomes for a second, just the fact a real hitter was able to come up makes the moment way more exciting and tense for both sides.  If a pitcher was coming up the entire Twins fan base would be groaning and rolling their eyes while Yankees would be sighing in relief.",baseball
"I can’t recal who it was that wrote it, but it was put really well in a tweet I read (I think it was Ahmed Fareed). Essentially he said imagine if baseball always had a system to objectively call balls and strikes consistently. Then the commissioner comes out and proposes that we start a system that would make a handful of bad calls every game and then argue that was best for the game. 

That commissioner would look like a moron. Yet people criticize the opposite proposal.",baseball
"The Major League Baseball rulebook does not contain an official definition for a checked swing, but defines a swing as ""an attempt to strike at the ball"". It is the decision of the umpire as to whether an attempt was made or not. Generally, factors such as whether the bat passes the front of the plate or the batter pulls their wrists back are considered in the ruling. Some umpires prefer to use the ""breaking the wrists"" criterion as the method to decide a checked swing: if the wrists ""rolled over"", a swing occurred.",baseball
"As a cancer survivor...it is so annoying how every sport uses it as a profit mechanism. Damn pink ribbon football and all this shit. 

Why don't we spend money on health care (so people can see a doctor and get an early diagnosis for cancer or anything else) and less on exploiting illnesses that make too much money to cure. Fuck Lance Armstrong. Fuck Pink Ribbons. Fuck The American Cancer Society. The last things these organizations want is cancer to be eradicated. They get way too much emotion money to want it eliminated.",baseball
"They're going to a new pitcher because Urquidy looked like he was losing touch on his stuff a little bit. He grooved a few fastballs in his previous innings and got away with it.

Buck even mentioned that Chirinos appeared to signal to Hinch to get someone warm in that inning. It's not a shock to see this move being made now.",baseball
"Thank you, I (we) appreciate it.
It's not really strength, it's just the hand that we were dealt, so we deal with it the best way that we know how. My daughter doesn't know anything other than me being her sole parent, so this is her reality. 
I (we) have been very fortunate, in that my wife left us with some amazing friends (and family) that she touched, and care for her deeply, to look after me and our daughter that support us, so we have had been blessed to see some of the best in people.",baseball
"No. But baseball is a business, and in my business, you would be disbarred if there were viable allegations of domestic violence. I think they handed out the suspension he deserved and he served it. I don’t think he should get a lifetime ban but he deserved every game he got. But let’s not pretend a conviction means jack shit as to whether you’re guilty. The court of law is one thing, ethical and appropriate behavior in and out of the workplace is a whole different ballgame, so to speak. I’m not crying for someone if they lose their job after beating the mother of their child, but I’m also not saying he’s irredeemable. Needing a conviction to suspend would be a gross violation of ethics.",baseball
"My wife and I are Indians fans.  I love Brantley.  She loves Gomes.  We thought this would be a great series to watch while we root for our former favorites to win a ring.  Now we aren't even watching and are both just hoping the Astros are embarassed.  Nice job, MLB!",baseball
"I’ll drink to that. I never come here for that reason, it’s toxic. 

You should pay attention, but there is circumstances where one due to no fault of their own may lose focus on the game for just the briefest of moments and may not be able to protect themselves or others on a hard hit ball &amp; even if they were paying attention it be difficult to protect against a ball coming at those types of speeds. Idk why this is so hard for people to accept. &amp; In the end it’s not going to affect sales at all.",baseball
I would think it would have to do with throwing distance? The ball would need to be in deep in either or corner for it to make sense. Anything hit to right in the air the runner will tag from second to third. Not sure I see a lot of tag ups when the ball is hit to left and the runner is at second.,baseball
"And the LORD did say, I shall raise up a challenger against them, that they may remember a time when they were not division winners, and did call upon their GOD OF BASEBALL for aid.

"In the past there were managers who were also active players for the team “player-managers” but it has been a long time since that happened. Pete Rose was the last one back in the 80’s. But they weren’t used as mop up pitchers. 

The most comedic choice for mop up pitchers is now to use position players such as outfielders or  infielders. In fact, this practice has become vastly more common in the past several seasons. 

In fact, it has become so common that baseball has a new rule starting next year aimed at curtailing the practice, in which position players will not be allowed to pitch during the first nine innings of a game when the winning team is leading by under seven runs.",baseball

"Right, cease is 23 years old and by far the best pitching prospect the Cubs had since probably mark prior. 

Again, you're telling me the if the yankees offered Torres and Lemahieu for Rizzo and Contreras the Cubs decline it? GTFO. Hell Torres alone may be worth more than Rizzo and Contreras. There isnt much of a market for a 30 year old first baseman with chronic back issues and a 27 yo catcher who has leg issues every single year and who's only played 130+ games once in his career. 

You're telling me if the Sox offered Jimenez and cease for Hendricks and schwarber the Cubs decline it? GTFO. 

Stop playing fantasy baseball. The Cubs take every one of those trades in a heartbeat and don't think twice about it. The issue is, the yankees or the Sox wouldn't offer those deals, because they aren't stupid.

Yes but like... no. I’ll take the downvotes on a fresh account but it’s different.

"It is. But the way you teach history in the US means there isn't a lot of time. There's a lot of reteaching with more detail. So, you learn some basic history in elementary school. And where I lived you did World History in 7th Grade, US History in 8th Grade, State History in 9th Grade, World History in 10th Grade again (more in depth, though), US History again in the 11th (more in depth again), and then Government or Civics/Current Events/Econ/etc Senior year. So for US history, you're trying to fit 500 years into 180 school days, and you have to pick and choose what you go in depth with. It's even more extreme with World History, so they mostly gloss.over or skip everything but European History.

"I was going to say that, the Yankees way outperformed what they should have for half the decade given how the team was. The Dodgers may have underperformed but still not that bad. 

Those early 2010's Tigers teams should have won multiple titles though. 

Another point for maybe the Angels who've done precisely nothing with the best player in baseball by a mile. The Mariners who aren't even able to be good enough to be disappointing like this. The Marlins which are a shit show.",baseball
"I think they kinda miss Harper here. 

He definitely has the highest ceiling of hitters in his range - kinda like Puig where the talent is still there but it sometimes doesn't translate to a 162 game season consistently. 

But this is just my theory that talent tends to come through in bigger moments when the hyperfocus is there like his homer in the 2017 NLDS vs Cubs.",baseball
"Post season plate appearances is not a stat that is affected by league specific rules, since it only depends on being one of the best teams in your league and advancing far in the playoffs. Unless you consider that the NL used to have 16 teams while the AL had 14, making it harder to make the postseason in the NL. However, I don't think that's making much of a difference here.

This stat is only useful for the last 24 years, which is when the playoffs expanded to three rounds.",baseball
"Stras, 10 years older than me but same elementary and hug I school and when he got drafted he stopped by for little league opening day and I remember hearing that he donated a ton to it. Funny part is that if I could give you a description of what the typical 'Santee guy' looked like it'd essentially come out to him lmao",baseball
"I agree with their premise that liberals desperately need to be satirized, but I just don’t think they’re that good at it.  It takes knowledge of actual positions in order to satirize properly, and they just don’t have it, as evidenced by the same “lol AOC is dumb and Sanders likes taxes” headlines over and over.  

The Christian satire, however, is sooooo damn good, because their knowledge of that subculture is so immense.  They also destroy Osteen on a weekly basis.",baseball
"I mean that's not a bug, it's a feature. It's very much in the interest of the league/owners to have funds for new stadiums be as taxpayer funded as possible. But we're beginning to enter an age where municipalities are more and more resistant to using exorbitant amounts of public funds to build them. But teams use the threat of moving as leverage because we're irrational creatures and millions have invested lots of time and money into ""their"" team that helps them feel part of a tribe so, and the amounts of money we're talking about when financing stadiums is so large that in our brains it becomes an abstract concept in opposition with the real visceral feeling of losing that team.

And I'll just mention that I'm very Anti-Taxpayer funded stadiums, and while I think owners and the league are assholes for how they conduct business in regards to stadiums, let's not confuse ""poorly run"" with ""ran in a way I find disagreeable"". Because new stadiums for as little team capital as possible IS manfred running the league in a way that's most aligned with their self interest.",baseball
Astros are the national baseball media's team don't you know.  if they lose it can't be the other teams play - no no no - no other team is as great as this astros team remember.  its got to be the ball or some other bs reason.  pathetic!,baseball
"You mean a catcher who can only play around 110 games a year and hit an average of 17 home runs a year???? No, those are pretty easy to find, actually the Cubs already have one. Cartini would put up similar, if not better number than Contreras if he was moved to full time, and he's more durable. You can find a catcher that will top out at 24 homeruns and 70 rbi's pretty easily these days. Those aren't hard numbers to beat. 

Riggght they have ""better guys now"" at those positions lmao!! That's the problem. The Cubs just have too many good players hahahaha right. 

There is no way in hell the Cubs turn down any one of those deals. Not a chance in hell. The other teams won't make those deals though because again, they aren't stupid. 


Ok I downvoted you. No problem. If you want more downvotes lemme know. 
You're right on one thing, you can't keep proving me wrong, because you can't prove me wrong. The Cubs aren't as talented as some idiot fans think. This is an 84 win team, with 84 win talent. Maybe you like being mediocre, hell you've prolly been it your life and it's comfortable to you. Some people are losers, so hey embrace who you are, but when a team is claiming they want to ""build something long term"" and then goes and trades away all their future talent for half year rentals and leaves the cupboard bare, they failed. Theo failed. 20 years from now when they are asking ""why didn't the 2016 Cubs become a dynasty?"" The answer will be simple, the GM traded away more talent than he had, and he didn't keep any of the talent he traded those guys for ....oh except for the great Jose Quintana of course.",baseball
"Lol sick burn. Care to comment on the substance of the comment?

Edit: Since we're editing our comments instead of going at it with an onslaught of replies like the 21st century savages we are...Don't you DARE  bring Dunkin into this! As someone who crushes wicked Dunkin on a dailey basis, ked, I call foul.",baseball
"Hahahahahahhaa what the fuck are you talking about? Whoever said anything the NFL sending people to jail?

The rule couldn’t be more clear. If you fail a drug test —- that’s what “use” means — you get suspended. The rule doesn’t say a single word about requiring that the player be charged with a drug crime to be punished by the NFL. I have no clue where you’re getting that.

Have you seriously never heard of a player being suspended for failing a drug test for weed with no criminal charges? [It happens all the time](https://thefreshtoast.com/culture/all-the-nfl-players-facing-marijuana-suspensions-this-season/)",baseball
I’m rooting for you guys in this series. I just mean that you guys should have struggled in the NLCS against the Braves and been feeling bullpen anxiety in the NLCS like you did in the NLDS. I didn’t mean to come across salty I didn’t word that correctly sorry.,baseball
"*Rainey on the bench* 

“God those astros are such good hitters it’s like they kn-“ 

“FUCK YOU” 

“Max what? Did I do some-“ 

“What did you throw 10 pitches? Those are rookie numbers” 

“Well technically I still am a roo-“ 

“Get the fuck back out there” 

“But coa-“ 

“GET THE FUCK BACK OUT THERE”",baseball
"I dont get this. I know the Nats bullpen is bad, but you're potentially facing two of the best teams in the last 10 years in the next round. It makes more sense to save his arm for that series than push him in a game you're 99% sure to win already",baseball
"&gt; Is it the first or third base ump?

Depends if the batter is left or right handed.

&gt; Why does the catcher point to the guy? 

Because they want the call in their favor and the home plate umpire hasn't signalled yet. In some instances, I've seen the catcher, batter, pitcher, and home plate umpire all do that point. But the only one that **actually** matters is whether the home plate umpire points over.",baseball
"I’m not defending Hamilton, but what the fuck are you reading. Nowhere in there does it say he threw a chair at her and that it broke when it hit her. Where the hell did you pull that from?  Maybe you should learn to read before calling someone else brain damaged.",baseball
"The Montreal franchise sustained baseball well until the very end and had a crap stadium that played a big role. No disrespect to Tampa, but to my knowledge the fan base never reached Montreal levels nor had sustained fan support throughout their Franchise. My preference is for Montreal to be awarded a new franchise, but is baseball isn't viable in Tampa after a few decades, something needs to give.",baseball
"[A comparison of base running and sliding techniques in collegiate baseball with implications for sliding into first base](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jshs.2015.03.008)

Edit: the paper basically says diving head first MIGHT be faster than running through the base IF the dive is timed perfectly so that you fully extend and touch the base before you are any contact with the ground. But given the difficulty of that, it’s very unlikely, and the gain, if any, would be non-significant",baseball
"Pitchers are an overall negative to offensive game, I understand that. I’m just used to how the game is played in the NL cause that’s what I’ve grown up with.  Pitchers getting hits gets me hyped beyond belief. And AL and NL baseball have very observable differences in their results, AL is more offensive and NL is less offensive, I might be misinterpreting what you’re saying but it’s just untrue that the DH doesn’t have an impact of the flow of the game",baseball
You actually sound delusional with the way you're talking. JV hasn't lost 10 game fours in a row on short rest. Why do you keep making shit up to try to get your point across and put words in other people's mouths about how we would hypothetically feel if that did happen? You've got to be a pompous asshole to think that way.,baseball
I'm pretty sure he was in high school when he made those comments. You've never known someone who said things just for shock value? Part of being young is pushing boundaries and society is supposed to forgive young people for going too far and instead guide them in the right direction. Are you the same person that you were in high school?,baseball
"3rd base coach, yes. Not sure about the 1st base coach though. He seems to only be there to congratulate the runner on getting a single. I don't know what strategy he would give the runner unless he knows what the pitcher does in order to steal a base, but I'm sure someone will ultimately prove me wrong lol",baseball
"Pitch Type | Spin Rate | Horz Break | Vert Break

FF          |     2263      |         11.4       |        15.4

FC         |     2080      |         -1.6       |         4.7

KC         |     2013       |         -3.3       |        -7.1

Couple weird things about Paxton. His fastball has the highest spin rate out of all his pitches, and his cutter and knuckle curve play like a fast and slow slider with sharp vertical break. Cutter gets almost no horizontal break and KC gets very little.

Those are compared to a theoretical pitch thrown at the same speed with no spin induced movement. Measured in inches.",baseball
"This brings up another important point; why the fuck is this a non-reviewable call? Why are there non-reviewable calls really at all? Like why are we restricting the use of instant replay?

edit: I guess it is reviewable? I remember that happened to the Yankees a couple of years ago and it wasn't reviewable but idk I guess I'm wrong",baseball
"It's not -that- bad of a call if they called interference. If he hit his glove and he wasn't in the baseline, it -is- interference as far as I know, and determining if the first baseman's glove is in or out of the baseline is pretty hard to tell live, it's pretty close even on replay imo. I might be wrong on that though.

^^^^Bring ^^^^on ^^^^the ^^^^hate ^^^^:(",baseball
"Won't matter, but that's just dumb Dave.  You got the runs anyways and it worked out to not even matter.  If this game by some miracle tightens up and a crucial error is made by your bench coach you just lost the WS that you are now in control of.",baseball
"That's just not how probability works though. Let's say two teams are evenly matched in this situation. Game 6 has a 100% chance to happen, but only has a 50% chance of determining who wins, because the Astros still might win game 7. Game 7 only has a 50% chance of happening, but a 100% chance of determining who advanced. They are worth the exact same. It's a bit counter-intuitive, but it's correct.",baseball

"Used to do public address for a minor league team. Super helpful to have these. Sometimes, a super recently called up player who just joined the team and whose name wasn't on the list would enter the game and the folks in the press box would be asking each other for confirmation of correct pronunciation.",baseball
"I never liked baseball that much as a kid...I think it’s cause it was the only sport I was bad at. And I’m not trying to brag or say I was great at other sports cause I wasn’t. I could just get away with playing them and was usually better than the average kid. (Soccer, Basketball, Football). 

But now it turned into my favorite sport, which I never thought would be possible. I love the game so much and now it makes no sense to me when people say it’s boring or that they don’t like it. It has such a charm to it for so many reasons. It’s almost impossible to explain until you get deep into it. It’s such a weird and funny and cool sport. It’s unlike anything else.",baseball
"100% It was so clear, then Snyder walked to the mound and they didnt get a hit again until the 7th and a single with no runs. Then the eventual pair of HRs on our late BP just like I pictured it. The top of the first was total BS but the rest of the game was dead on. That's my only beef, we should have had our hearts broken after holding a 1-0 lead until the 8th.",baseball
"100% standard at Yankee Stadium, though - regular season, or postseason.

They have a pre-recorded presentation that plays before every game called ""Ground Rules for Fans"" that covers things like not entering field of play, not throwing objects onto the field, being aware for baseballs and bats that might enter the stands, and how to contact security or guest services if you have a problem.",baseball
"Less than 40% of Seattleites are native to the state of Washington, we traded away all our good players last year, and have the longest postseason drought of any team, combined with a historic lack of success. Our stadium is one of the most expensive to visit in the league and is in a rough neighborhood (by Seattle standards anyway). If the Mariners come up in conversation in Seattle, it is almost always as the butt of a joke. The Mariners only barely won a third of their games this year.

Yet they still significantly outdrew the Rays, more than 8,000 fans per average game. There is something deeply wrong with Tampa Bay's sports fandom.",baseball
"Sure, the same thing is true with Sanchez. It's hard to quantify how much a guy like that shuts down the running game when he's not getting as many CS attempts because teams just don't run on him. Your comment just kinda came across like you were shitting on McCann, though. Nobody questions that Yadi was better defensively, but it's also inarguable that McCann was a better hitter. Both of them have been great.",baseball
"Man come on dude.  You try to paint me as being so petty about something that I lump everything associated with it as a bad thing, and then you go this route?  Is orange man bad your trump card for every person you talk to who maybe thinks coke is better than pepsi?  Weak",baseball
"

And now, when Max grows angry or outraged, a startling metamorphosis occurs. The creature is driven by rage and pursued by an investigative reporter.

The creature is wanted for a murder he didn't commit. Max Sherzer is believed to be done for the season. And he must let the world think that he *is* done, until he can find a way to control the raging spirit that dwells within him.",baseball
"That's an interesting angle to it, but I doubt it played much of a part. TV was beginning to become huge in the late 50s and 60s. The 58 Championship Game was crucial in establishing the NFL nationally, and of course, the biggest factor was the war between the NFL and AFL which established teams in smaller cities and not just in the East and Midwest. 

Baseball didn't help itself either, they changed the rules to accommodate pitchers heavily, which made the game less exciting among a lot of other social miscues.",baseball
After seeing how Nationals utilized their bullpen I knew by game 4 Astros were gonna do damage offensively I was 50/50 about Astros winning game 3. But Astros have proven to make their opponents regret their pitching like the Dodgers in 2017. For example taking out a starter to bring another one in one game I knew they fucked up,baseball
"Because the Astros &amp; their fan base have got to be the smuggest most pompous team/fans in mlb. They weren’t shit for forever, had to tank multiple seasons to build a team, won one WS and now they act like they’re perennial world beaters. If you go into their sub even tonight there’s literally fans that un-ironically refer to them as possibly the best team in the history of mlb. I shit you not. It’s like they’ve all adopted/embraced Verlanders shitty personality/attitude. The only Astro I even like is Altuve. That dude seems like a cool guy. The rest come across as self impressed assholes.",baseball
"You make it sound like everybody in all those low-level leagues is going to spring training and EST. And that's simply not true.  You can try to personalize this, but you don't get your own facts.  If you're in EST in the first place, it's because you're not very good.",baseball
"The ump really isn't that bad. People are just biased as hell. If you took every pitch, he would be ahead of most bad umps in the MLB no doubt. Has not been calling a lower ball much, but both sides have gotten it multiple times in big positions consistently.",baseball
"It was a great game no denying that but going into tonight's game the Brewers were huge underdogs and as a fan knew they would not make it out. If we had our pitchers at full health and Yelich we might be in a better situation but I feel pretty good with the hand that was dealt to us and hoping the Nats crush the Dodgers, good luck!!!",baseball
"I've been off and on looking at jobs in Tampa just to be a better rays and bolts fan. Drove like 700 miles for opening day earlier this year, and planning on driving back down for games 3 and 4 of the ALDS if the rays hold on to this lead.",baseball
"It was a bit misleading when the announcer said ""It's been a looooong 40 plus years"" or whatever, as the A's have won a world series in that time frame. Not that it means the eight straight winner take all losses haven't been painful, but at least you won the series in 89",baseball
"I know you said it before they explained on TV so you probably know now but just for people coming into this thread that might not have seen the game... they can’t review judgment calls, which interference is. So the Nats tried protesting the game, which you also cannot do on judgment calls unless it’s a gross error (paraphrasing what Joe Buck said), and the umpire in NY decided it wasn’t, so the Nats has no recourse at all.",baseball
"The tarp was incorrectly stored so that when the rains came, the grounds crew was unable to roll the tarp out and properly cover the diamond so everything got soaked and the game was called off.  Basically the protest was that the game should've been able to be continued had the Cubs properly maintained their equipment and field.",baseball
"That's not even the rule they're interpreting. They're calling interference with the throw. Here's that rule:

*If any member of the batting team (including the coaches) interferes with a fielder's right of way to field a batted ball, the batter shall be declared out. If any member of the batting team (including the coaches) interferes with a fielder's right of way to field a thrown ball, the runner on whom the play is being made shall be ruled out. In both cases, the ball will be declared dead and all runners must return to their last legally occupied base at the time of the interference. **However, a runner is not obligated to vacate a base he is legally permitted to occupy to allow a defender the space to field a batted or thrown ball in the proximity of said base**.*",baseball
"So it’s a bit confusing, but because it’s a judgement call, it’s not reviewable, but the Nationals can play the game under protest. Meaning if the league finds that the in-game officials misapplied the rule the game can be replayed from a certain point. I think they checked with the league to make sure they didn’t misapply the rule, so they wouldn’t have to deal with the debacle of having a World Series game played under protest and possibly having to replay it.",baseball
"Both of those were actually fielded in the vicinity of first, and on the Drew one he was much further to the left of the line than Turner was.

Also, I think it's pretty telling that both of those examples are from 2015 and as far as I can tell they're the only videos on youtube of this call being made. It's clearly not something that happens all the time as that first guy said.",baseball
"It's stupid because balks are not a dead ball in most age 13-17 youth leagues. In fact, the rules of most of those leagues provide for play to continue and then for the opposing coach to select whether they want the balk penalty or the result of the play, similar to choosing whether to accept or decline a penalty in football.",baseball
"&gt;4.06 No Fraternization
Players in uniform shall not address or mingle with spectators, nor
sit in the stands before, during, or after a game. No manager, coach
or player shall address any spectator before or during a game.
**Players of opposing teams shall not fraternize at any time while in

Can't believe the level of disrespect they're showing to the game where the lights shine the brightest.",baseball
"&gt;  just as funny if it was a dude who knew nothing.

I mean it was originally supposed to be this then she was hilarious so they her do it instead of him. its the opposite of what some people are assuming is going on but thats just what people do unfortunately. its also become very common to hate on barstool and I'm really not sure why (anymore atleast)",baseball
"SP1-  The Dodgers Kershaw is one of the biggest chokers in baseball history and that's well documented.  His velocity is gone and now and he had one of the worst playoff appearances last year which is saying something especially for him.

SP2- Ryu is a fat junk baller and not that great of a playoff pitcher 5.21 ERA in the playoffs last year

SP3-  Buehler is overrated as hell all he has is that fastball, Honeycutt really should have taught him another pitched by now.

SP4-  Dick Mountain is probably the Dodgers best playoff pitcher but  dude is getting up there in age and has had a long of injuries.



Bullpen-  Dodgers bullpen pretty decent



Closer: Jansen

Setup: Baez, Kelly

MR: May, Maeda, Sadler, Gonsolin

LR: Urias

LH Specialist: Kolarek

The Dodgers closer is borderline washed up they should really move Kelly to closer but their manager is in an idiot, and I don't say that just to insult him he really is an idiot.

The hitters have been known to go cold in the playoffs especially Bellinger, Pederson, Seager are overrated young bats tbh Bellinger couldn't hit a breaking ball in the playoffs to save his life throw it in the dirt he'll still swing at, he got NLDS MVP with a .143 batting average should tell you everything you need to know about the  Dodgers bats.



Nationals in 4",baseball
"We would have forgotten them until he repeated them the next series. 

With that said, there is no what if, there is only what became. He left in Joe for too long.

Dodgers are fortunate that the some of those Nats bombs stayed in as well if you want to play that game with Will Smith.",baseball
"Watch the linked video and you'll get it. Think of tipping pitches like ""tells"" in poker. Except way more involved and often way more subtle. The formal definition would be something like ""anything a pitcher does that is specific to a certain action"". One famous example I remember is hearing bagwell talk in a booth about how he could tell one specific pitcher was going to throw a change up because he'd see the muscles on his arm flex. Developing uniformity in your delivery is one of the things pitchers must perfect",baseball
"More bittersweet than anything else.  It sucks that the season ended tonight, but we still performed better than anybody - including many of us - expected after being dealt shitty hands all season long.  And we should get everyone back.

If we can thaw out our bats in the off-season and get Lowe to stop swinging at balls breaking to the inside, I think we might be able to take the World Series next year.  Everything about our current roster fucks except batting.",baseball
You people can circlejerk all you want. The Dodgers will ALWAYS be in it. Sooner or later they will dominate again. That is what burns you. You may win again. But you will fade into obscurity. Have your last place finishes. The Dodgers will always be the top franchise in NL baseball history. They will always have a winning culture. They will always have a greater history and counting than all your franchises put together. That is not me being a cocky Dodger fan. That is truth. That is FACT. I hope you all choke on your envy. It's fucking disgusting.,baseball
"Because the Cardinals, as an organization, are permanently and completely up their own ass; just listen to Shildt's post-game speech, one of the first things he says is ""we played the game right"" - the lack of awareness of both the organization and the ""best fans in baseball"" is astonishing.",baseball
"Kershaw is so great in the regular season and is on his way to the HOF when he is done. 

But MAN he is shit in the playoffs constantly. I don't knew what the Dodgers should do about him. He WANTS to get better, to be able to change the narrative. 

It is a bit sad really",baseball
"I think a lot of it has to do with how fortunate a lot of them feel to play the game. Having that combination of luck and skill can make you search for a higher power, I’d imagine. Also a good portion of the American players are from southern, more religious states like Georgia, Florida and Texas",baseball
"Clearly that “secretly, I love the Yankees” commercial was written by a Yankees fan. But, haha, charade you are, imaginary commercial writer! Like most Yankee fans she’s so disinterested in baseball by Halloween that her *own* *husband* wouldn’t know she rooted for them.

Edit: This is me being irrationally annoyed by a commercial.",baseball
"Guys, even if your team is losing by 3 runs late in an elimination game, you have to still play your hardest and do what you can to try to rally your team.  If that means trying to get your hitters fired up over your productive pitching performance, then so be it.  Don't be hating.",baseball
"Love the question

In terms of development, Tampa is a pretty massive basketball producer (like the rest of the state) but a lot of my friends growing up would cheer for teams that they had family ties to or just pick the Heat/Magic. Tampa as a whole is pretty out of the NBA loop as a result. Never as big as Hockey, Football or Baseball",baseball
"You realize umps can influence a score right?

Just take it to the extreme to understand it better. Imagine game 6 starts with the ump calling literally every pitch a ball until Verlander walks in the 19th run. And then every single time the Astros get runners in scoring position he calls every pitch a strike so they only score once on a solo homer. Nats win 19-1 so the Astros totally shouldn't complain about the umps, right?

The ump only blew a handful of calls but unfortunately the ones that benefitted the Nats were with 2 outs and bases empty whereas the ones that benefitted the Astros put runners on right before a home run and in one case extended the inning to allow the home run in the first place or they occured when the Nats had RISP and thus killed any chance to score runs. The strike 3 to Victor Robles was absolutely ridiculous.",baseball

"To me it looked like he over ran the ball (to his left) probably thinking it wasn't coming in that hot and that fast.  Cause it looked like he had to reach to his right (after over running the ball) and the ball was already past him at that point.  He's lucky he clipped it with his glove.

"lol, this has nothing to do with belief. The value of x- statistics is to normalize random outcomes to the expected value. 

&gt;They describe things in the past

No they don't. They describe what *normally happens* when a pitcher pitches like he did in the past. There is a meaningful distinction between those two things. xFIP may be a ""terrific way to get a sense of how well a pitcher's been throwing the ball"", but it does *not* describe what happened. FIP describes what happened. xFIP **predicts** what his FIP should be moving forward based on how he threw the ball, because it uses **expected** values of HRs. 

Josh Hader gave up 15 home runs last year. That's how he performed. Next year, based on how he pitched, he'll likely give up fewer. But you can't look at his performance and say it was actually as good as Yates' because normally those fly balls don't turn in to home runs. Because they did. 

&gt; For this reason, our pitcher Wins Above Replacement (WAR) is based on FIP rather than xFIP. They gave up the home runs so they count against them, but xFIP suggests they probably won’t continue to do so in the future.

"No it isn’t. The dude had been lights out and was only at 70 pitches. He just gave up a walk but that was partly due to the worst ball/strike call of the game. He deserves a chance to get out of that jam. Pulling him clearly rattled the entire team as the bats were dead from then on too. That move decided this game, and Hinch deserves the blame.",baseball
"Rather than straight up robotic umpires, I would prefer a tennis style system where each batter (and I guess each pitcher as well) should get 2-4 hawkeye-style ""challenges"" to use throughout the game on ball/strike calls. These would be done quickly by a simple indication to the umpire, and shouldn't take more than 10-15 seconds. Perhaps this could be only used for calls on whether the ball caught the plate or not, as that's objective, whereas the strike zone up and down is more subjective.. although it could still be used for particularly egregiously bad calls up or down.

I'd also like to see more things (why not all plays?) reviewable, although perhaps I'd get rid of the manager challenge situation altogether. I think current umps have the wrong attitude, left over from the old era when they'd have to stick by their call, and instead should be completely ready to cast ego aside and immediately ask for help whenever needed on a close or unusual play (like in Rugby). Instead of ""calling New York"" this could be done much quicker by having a video referee at the stadium, constantly checking all camera angles on any play which looks like it might be reviewed, and ready to have a decision within 30 seconds instead of the minutes it usually takes.",baseball

"The pettiness is on the umps here, not the players. Umps don’t adjust these calls over interference, they adjust them over pride and ego because they *must* say their strike or ball call before *anyone* moves, even when the call is obvious.

Make whatever judgements about my logic that you like. The umps exist to serve and work for the MLB, which players play in. If you want to split hairs over what that means be my guest. Anyhow, they are absolutely employed to make the correct call in the most impartial manner possible in the interest of letting *players* determine the outcome of the game, not them. Say they work for “MLB the organization,” The end result should still be the same. Umps need to keep their egos the hell out of their calls, if they can’t do that then they shouldn’t be working for this league.",baseball
"What are you talking about? We had the lead before he took Green out of the game. Then he went to Ottavino in the middle of the inning despite Green pitching great, and it only being the 5th inning.

"I mean for a season there, it looked like they were pretty much on-point. His 2016 season (the season that started a month after this post) was the worst of his career 

They were pretty close with their projections for BABIP and WOBA. ISO was a little further off but they actually way over-estimated his WAR (projected 1, finished with 0.3) for the season.

Then 2017 rolled around and it's like 2016 never happened, he went right back to his previous averages.

Another 2 seasons later and in 2019 he suddenly starts producing .058 higher xBA, .160 higher xSLG, and a crazy .418 xWOBA; putting him the 100th percentile for xBA, 98th for xSLG, and 98th in xWOBA. Hell, his OPS was 50% higher in 2019 than 2016.

"How’s this for a consolation: your team went 11 for 91, making your 0.121 batting average the lowest of any team in any post season series. I can’t seem to find info on what the regular series record is, but it’s conceivable you can drop the word “post season” from that record.",baseball
"The point of a curveball like this isn’t to get a SO in the zone like you would a fastball. It’s to get the batter to swing (or chase) the ball by at first making it look like a fast pitch down the middle of a plate, only for it to drop off and make it very difficult to hit. 

The reason a pitcher like Greinke is very difficult to deal with is because he has good command of many different types of pitches. A pitcher who can dot the corners of a strike zone with 90mph+ &amp; drop a perfect slider or curveball is a lot harder to deal with than say a pitcher who consistently relies on their fastball or who has an inaccurate fastball but a very good slider. Batters know the types of pitchers they’re facing and can plan accordingly, unless you’re facing someone like Greinke who can change their pitchers frequently because they have good command.

Soto was likely expecting a fastball towards the bottom of the zone which is why he SO on the curve. Extremely good pitch by Greinke.",baseball

"Posted this during game 4:

I played baseball for about 14 years, ending when I went off to college. I wrote it off for so many years as boring, or just too much to pay attention to. I always had love for my Nats, but wasn't in love like I used to be. 

The love for baseball slowly reignited with 2012, 2014, and 2017. The bug biting over and over but not fully breaking the skin. As I watched the 2019 wild card game with bated breath, Soto smashed that ball in the eighth and after being tagged out, screamed 'LET'S GOOOO', seemingly straight at me. 

Then the NLDS. With aniticiaption I rode that rollercoaster, just happy to be there. We get to a Game 5, in LA. A precipitous place to be. We get into extra innings with two huge dingers. It's already unreal. 

I watch them walk Soto. A sign of utmost disrespect for the batter on deck. 

Maybe it's watching this team, with these guys in the clubhouse, and how much they obviously don't take for granted the fact that they play ball for a living. 

Maybe it's my six week old son who's watched every game with me. 

**But when Howie Kendrick stood up at the plate and ripped a Grand Slam of all things to send us to the NLCS for the first time ever, I felt 10 again. I remembered all those nights falling asleep to the Orioles on the radio. The pure joy of a boy playing baseball.**

"So true. And like injury is a legit reason why a pitcher will struggle but then he won't get to use that since only reason he got injured was cuz he wasn't used to the load (cuz sitting at home).

"Basically, if the runner interferes with the 1st baseman catching the ball, it's interference.  There's a huge addendum on this though, that they're protected if they're inside the running lane for the last 45 feet of the path.  The running lane is the path in between the two marked lines on the field and he was never in the path.  He's allowed to be in fair territory for the last couple of steps and still be protected, but only if he's coming from the running lane.  

The gif shows that he was never in the running lane, and I think the point that the guy above is making is that the gif is showing that Holbrook was clearly watching the runner the entire time in making the call.",baseball

"But you realize that’s his point right? The only reason it’s interference in one case is because a bad throw was made. So the Nats get punished for Peacock making a bad play? How can turner adjust to a bad throw that he can’t see? Why should he have to adjust to a bad throw in the first place? The fact that altuve isn’t interfering, and he is not, is exactly the point.

"Totally disagree to be honest. The Nats had a rough start which is why they only made it in on a WC spot, but were one of the best teams in the NL for like 2/3rds of the season. They have a rotation that is legitimately comparable to the Astros rotation, and it really seem like every position player on that team is clicking at the right moment. Momentum is absolutely huge in a postseason run, and right now the Nats have a lot of it.

In a Yankees Nats World Series I would legitimately favor the Nats, and I think they have a real shot vs the Astros. This isnt me saying the Nats are shoeins to win, but I really think sleeping on the Nats at this point is kinda crazy.",baseball
"By my quick math using ESPN attendance figures:

The Dodgers had 3,974,309 total attendance and 59 home wins. That's 67,361 fans attending per win.

The Tigers had 1,501,430 total attendance and 22 home wins.  That's 68,247 fans attending per win.

""Fans attending per win"" probably isn't the right term since it isn't a one game average, but you get the idea.",baseball
"Does anyone find this as interesting moving forward? In the era of the home run ball, the teams seem to be getting more dominated by good pitching then previously before in the playoffs. During the course of the regular season eventually the runs go up because you play enough bad pitching. But at the end of the year when all that is left are good players, it looks ugly.",baseball
"I agree, but god it just feels so bad, especially all the people hogging on Sanchez for arguing it. Like what do you want the guy to do, it's objectively not a strike, it's not his fault that the umpire gave him the last one. I'd hate to be Gary, he's just getting punished for the ump making a bad call.",baseball
Why wasn’t Gomes allowed to stay at second after the call? On a ground ball with a runner on first and the play is made at first obviously the runner advances to at least second. I was almost more upset that they put Gomes at first after calling Turner out!,baseball
"I don’t disagree that he makes contact with the glove before yuli can make a play, however, trae is in the air on his final stride straight to the bag running at close to 30 ft/s before yuli reaches into the lane to catch the ball and I guess my question is how is he supposed to avoid that? We can discuss whether or not he should have to be in the “lane” but once he’s at the bag where is he supposed to go? This isn’t softball, there’s no other bag. When a bad throw causes the first baseman to go into the line himself why does the runner get punished? A good throw and this isn’t even a conversation, he’s either safe or out based on if the throw beat him and either way the nats have a runner in scoring position. But a bad throw not only takes a hit away from trae on something he had no control over and no way to avoid but punishes the nats more than a good throw with trae doing the exact same thing would have since Gomes is on first.",baseball
"You are correct that he didn't interfere in the practical aspect as the throw was off-line and from an angle where he never got in the way of an accurate throw. However, the rule is clear here: the runner is not allowed to the left of the foul line once the runner's lane is marked (last 45') The rule is in place to give the fielder a open lane for when the throw is coming from right on the foul line.

There may be an oversight in the rules, as they mark any runner out of the runner's lane to be liable to be called out for interference, ~~not just those that actually interfere with a throw.~~ But don't roast the umps for applying the rules correctly as they are written, call for the rule to be adjusted.

EDIT: not just those that move to run into the fielder but those that are instead contacted by the fielder. Gurriel's glove came off and the throw was in that area for him to catch. Turner was out of the lane, and he made contact with the fielder. Those points are clear regardless of judgement. No matter who initiated contact, the runner has no rights as he is out of the runner's lane on the side of the play.",baseball
"I've seen him disagree with umpires, but you generally don't need him to jump in and explain a wrong call, because everyone is loudly proclaiming the wrong call, so he likely just upvotes those and moves on.  The problem is that the loud proclamations continue on correct calls, like this one, and so he ends up being a lone voice explaining why the call is right.",baseball
"A good way to know if a stat is impressive is to look into the comparables. If they're not mentioned chances are it's either not that great and just a chance thing, if the only other batter to do it is Barry Bonds, probably important

Example is when the graphic says ""2nd ever to ______"" and first isn't mentioned, it's probably Joe ""Pepper"" Whogivesashit in 1943 when everyone good was fighting in WWII

Nelson Cruz joined a pretty crazy list this year by hitting 40 HR in his age-38 season. Only other guys to do it are Darrell Evans, Hank Aaron, and Barry Bonds",baseball
"Imagine being an adult that has spent their entire life perfecting their craft, then being told before they go on vacation for a couple months (after working for literally 200+ days put of the last 250) you need to write apologies to everyone that came to watch you work. 

Professional sports are fucking wierd man.",baseball
"If anything makes it worse. I remember an interview with Pat McAffee describing how guys would pop Vicodin like altoids on bus rides because they did technically need them, so they got them. The problem is anyone will hand them out, but no one wants to closely monitor your usage.",baseball
"Home field advantage, because the players get to sleep in their own bed, are used to the field, and have all their training equipment easily available. Not because some drunk guys are screaming at them.

I guarantee you, Yankee players do not want you screaming at Astros players. Cheering and booing is fine, even chanting is fine. Just treat the other players like actual people and realize it is a game.",baseball
"Never said it was luck. Just a lot of plays that barely went your way. Literal inches separated 

1) Judge from a near warning track shot

2) Britton stepping on 1st to beat the runner

3) Didi's catch

and that's just off the top of my head. Plus the fact that the Twins hit 5 batted balls at over 100mph and 4 of them ended up as outs. Lots of balls right to the fielders.

Edit: and 4) DJ's catch",baseball

He’s out there stone faced destroying teams. But Kershaw just looks unsettled out there. Can’t say I feel bad, but that’s tough.",baseball

Sure.

&gt; We hate Arizona fans more than Giants fans.


Nah.


&gt; We hate the Giants more than the Dbacks.

Yup.


&gt; We hate Coors more than Oracle or Chase.


Fair.


&gt; We honestly kinda like the Padres and I dont think any of us would really mind if they did well.


Yup.",baseball
One. Major. Reason. It’s a human game played by humans for the entertainment of humans. If I want perfect umps I’ll play MLB the Show. Actually I’ll have to change the setting on strike zone first because even the video acknowledges variable strike zones are part of the game. Stop messing with our game.,baseball
"They almost always give an excuse before they say anything like that, and then they give their rational. This time, however, Hinch doesn't even have the pitch count correct, so his explanation didn't match up. Greinke going to for one more innings could have easily been the difference in the game. 

Edit: And, yes, listening to Dave Roberts these last few years after the Dodgers have been eliminated has scarred me. He always says that he wouldn't change a thing, even after they've been eliminated, which makes no sense to me. He know that they've lost, and he'd keep everything the same. At least Hinch didn't say that, because WTF?",baseball

"Was he the one who kept pushing Girardi on the Mets job until the third guy stepped in?   I remember hearing this exchange (abbreviated):

Someone: ""You really enjoy New York.""

Joe: ""Yeah.   We had a lot of good memories with Brett and the guys and making it all the way.""

Someone: ""Well, that's when you were with the Yankees, but I'm more focused on where you're going.""

Third Guy: ""AAAAAAaaaand he's going to be in the booth calling the action coming at you right now!""",baseball
"bro I have a problem. I see things that I agree with and try to find another way that i dont agree with. while it's a good trait, i, for some reason take it to the extreme sometimes. all of those calls were shit and i agree. just saying this particular pitch isn't crazy to be called a ball. 


overall, im glad you won ( sorry, ya'll won). but this particular thing isnt something out of the ordinary, unlike the other pitches you mentioned",baseball
"only 10 hr in 100 at bats versus the best pitcher of the era. 

That would be the Walter Johnson who allowed 97 home runs in his 5914 IP. Babe Ruth hit more than 10% of the home runs he allowed in his career

Your argument also ignores the various advantages that the pitcher has had being eroded over the years.",baseball
"I think the main thing the OP is missing (besides those two), are just how many teams, after decades of futility, got back on top.

Prior to 2010, the Giants hadn’t won the World Series since the 1950s! Then we rattled off 3 in 5

The Cubs broke their curse, more than 100 years in the making!

The Astros got their first ever!

The Royals got their first in decades!

And either the Nationals will bring home their first ever, or the Astros will get just their second ever.

It’s been a fun decade for breaking looong losing streaks.",baseball
"I think a lot of the anger is that you *almost never* see this call get made in a regular game, and then on the biggest stage in baseball you see the call get made. So baseball fans not being used to this rule actually being called combined with the passion and intensity of the moment kind of sent everyone into a panic.",baseball
"Yeah its basically #1 and #2 or #3 in every pitching and hitting category going against each other. I'm just glad we were able to pull it out tonight so we could have this potentially all-time classic series this year. 

I'm hoping Greinke can give us some quality games going forward and that his outing in the Trop was just a combined product of the Rays needing that win and us always playing terribly there. I know he isn't a JV or Cole type of pitcher anymore, but he's certainly capable of going 6 or 7 with 0-2 runs when he's on. In either case, I'm sure this will go 7.",baseball
"I agree, but I’m probably an older baseball fan than most on this sub, and calls have always been missed when the catcher jumps around behind the plate like that. It actually used to be much more egregious, but framing has always been a part of the game. Smart front offices today value a catcher’s ability to frame. It can save a lot of runs over the course of a season.

We should have robo umps soon, which will pretty much eliminate the framing gamesmanship part of the game (which I will kind of miss as an older/Padres fan-Austin Hedges is very, very good at it, and he isn’t great at much else), but we have the tech to get calls right, so baseball should implement it, imo.",baseball
"Actually, there's a fairly decent correlation between reliever ability (measured either through ERA, fWAR, FIP or WPA) and a team's record in 1 run games. It's hardly definitive, but success in 1 run games are definitely more than luck.

The problem is also that luck is a major part of it as well, not to mention the whole ""relievers can fall apart and become useless at a moment's notice"" problem...",baseball
"Good god, with all these numbers for salaries being thrown around, do people ever just step back and think about the amount of cash? He's going to get $30 million+/year for throwing a baseball extremely well. If the average American makes $50k/year, Gerrit Cole is going to get 600x that, well of course a little less due to agents and taxes but still, nobody can say MLB is hurting.",baseball
"He had an 0.31 ERA/17 saves in 28 games for the Padres in 2016. We flipped him for Chris Paddack, who has done quite well for in his first season at age 23. Paddack did need TJ surgery after the Padres acquired him, but I for one, enjoyed our Fernando Rodney experience.",baseball
"This. Peak Mantle, and that’s with injuries, put up 2 straight 11 WAR seasons (according to bWAR and fWAR), and he hit 500+ HRs. Trout has yet to have one 11 WAR season, and “only” had two straight 10 WAR seasons his first two years according to fWAR.

Don’t get me wrong, Trout is undeniably an all-time talent, and will likely retire in GOAT territory if he plays another handful to several healthy years, but it’s yet to be seen if he’ll reach the absolute peak performance (multiple 11+ seasons) that Mantle did, and who knows what a healthy Mantle could have done.",baseball
"They said there were improvements in the manufacturing facilities that result in more balls falling within a lower range of the allowed tollerances, which include things like seam height and core tightness. Resulting in a ball both more aerodynamic and less elastic, so not only does it have less drag but more energy from the bat is converted into kinetic energy.",baseball
"In general colder temperatures decrease friction, but you also have to consider how humidity affects friction. Humidity usually decreases as it gets colder, and lower humidity means somewhat higher friction. So as far as environmental factors, it would require a lot more analysis than most of us are willing to do and a lot more data than most of us have to determine if you're full of shit",baseball
"Grisham wasn’t the only one to blame but he sure put the nail in the coffin. An error on a ground ball by and outfielder is bad. Also, how the fuck does counsell not call time when hader is deep in every count or the broken bat single, or the “HBP”? Help your guy calm down.",baseball
"This definitely won't be his last job in major league baseball. Let's be honest, if teams are willing to put DV abusers in their bullpen, they'll be willing to overlook comments he made to reporters to get Luhnow's protégé. It may not be all 30 teams, but some team out there is going to ""give him a 2nd chance"" at the thought of getting Luhnow 2.0 to run their organization.",baseball
"No, we don't need a video. We have an accusation from a reporter from one of the industry's largest media groups, a weak rebuttal and multiple other, non-SI sources confirming the original accusation.

Video would be nice, sure, but multiple witnesses confirming the event happened as described should be more than enough for us.",baseball
"I think there might be a multicollinearity problem with the parameters that you are looking at.  For example, age is probably highly correlated with a lot of the other parameters (K%, BB%, etc.). It's not surprising that age returned as the most indicative variable.
  
I think it makes sense to look at things like pitch velocity, I would guess that has a major impact on career length.",baseball
"Tbf Tigers were shit in the second half of the decade, but yeah. I'd say the early 2010s Tigers were extremely disappointing. Made the ALCS three times in a row, but came out with nothing. Then got embarrassed by the Orioles in the ALDS in 2014. Their roster was constructed to dominate short postseason series, but it just hasn't resulted in a WS title

Though I think the Tigers' failures, as well as the Giants' success, was a huge reason as to why teams started focusing on their bullpens more as opposed to starting pitching. Tigers were a great exhibit that stacking SP can only get you so far, if your bullepn is a disaster",baseball
"I do think people underestimated the Nats a bit. Not that the Dodgers weren’t the better team, but the Nats have been pretty elite after the first couple months of the season. I’ll actually go as far to say that if the Astros lose tomorrow they are my pick to win the WS.",baseball
"So.....to continue, you can be a dick, because you dont like a shirt Im wearing....that is completely harmless,  btw?

If that's how you live your life...all for it. But, I hope you'll never have children, because you won't be able to articulate why the bully in their life is the asshole.",baseball
"It always amazes me that the people who complain about the questions in sports interviews forget they once knew nothing about the sport.

I got my wife into baseball years ago and she still learns from some of these questions. As fans of Cleveland sports we have been blessed with Tom Hamilton as our radio announcer and she appreciates when he breaks down baseball, especially national league baseball.",baseball
"I think it’s also that the Phillies (in part because of adding Harper) were anticipated to be competitive and everyone knew the Jays were rebuilding and would be losing. I have no idea, but I’d be curious to see if the Phillies attendance was consistent or if it dipped once they were out of contention. 


I don’t think the Jays attendance is really an issue. Is an average of 21000 for a 67 win season bad? There’s no one ahead of them in average attendance with a worse record.",baseball
"This play is great for several reasons. The first is that it's a really fucking hard catch. One of the most difficult things in baseball is to catch a ball that's going over your head in the direction you're moving (look up Willie Mays ""the catch"" to see one of the most iconic plays in baseball history). The ball goes over Rendon's left shoulder and then either wind or spin takes it back towards his right and he has to adjust and dive for it.

This is so clutch because it is the bottom of the ninth inning with the presumptive (imo) MVP at bad as the tying run in a game the Nationals HAVE TO WIN. if the ball falls it's either first and third or a 4-3 game. Making that catch preserved the 2 run lead and brought it to within one out.

Welcome to baseball! It's the greatest sport in the world. Don't be afraid to ask questions. I've played/watched my entire 27 years on this planet and I learn new things every day.",baseball
"Craig Goldstein sums up what I've been trying to articulate:

&gt;[Dave Roberts has one move and it's going to Kershaw in G5 of the NLDS and it worked once and he thought he was a god

&gt;[It sucks ass for Kershaw and I absolutely resent and will not partake in the takeage to come but this is on Roberts. He shouldn't have been in the game. He shouldn't have been in the 8th.

the interference didn't matter in the grand scheme of things so probably the ball don't lie game? also if the bat carry becomes a thing I could see this game being remembered as the game that started it. I hope it carries over to game 7 and someone actually goes full pedro cerrano,baseball
"I wouldn't.  I get the feeling that you think you are on to something clever here and I'm not sure why.  Since a pitcher will likely have less than 100 at bats in a season, it is much more difficult for them to generate more runs than they can cost.

Seriously, what point do you think you are making?",baseball
"Yea as much as we have been burned as fans I think it’s overlooked how hard it is to get to the playoffs every year.

We could have collapsed last year with our terrible start but instead we got all the way to the big stage. I’ll never be one of those bitter fans",baseball
"I hate how they say “a controversial call”.... no, it was a wrong call.  It was flat out wrong and Jim Joyce was trying to steal the spotlight.  If baseball had any backbone or operated in anyway like the real world, Joyce should have been fired for it.",baseball
"Second Draft:

""Let's work out a good deal! You don't want to be responsible for men beating thousands of women, and I don't want to be responsible for throwing the world series - and I will. History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen.""",baseball
"A couple of points I discussed with a friend recently who isn’t a huge baseball fan:

Every play advances the game toward its conclusion. There is no timer, so every play matters in eventually deciding the winner. Every pitch advances the count toward an out or a baserunner. Also, since there is no time limit, there is no running out the clock or being unable to win simply because there’s not enough time left. A 10 run late inning comeback is improbable, but never impossible.",baseball
"OP: Hey dad!  

OP's dad: What is it?

OP: Sir, I was wondering, did you happen to catch the professional baseball contest on television last night?

OP's dad: No, I didn't

OP: Oh, it was most exhilarating.  The Yankees of New York took on the Twins of Minnesota, and in the end the Yankees triumphed by hitting a round ball made of horse hide over a wall with a thick wooden stick!  It was a most ripping victory!",baseball
"The weird thing is that most of this isn't muddied by home field advantage either. My original thought was ""well that makes sense, winning 2 at home means you have the better record. They should be able to take care of business after being up 2-0. Quality of team is more important than home field advantage"".

Then I remember for most of MLB's history they didn't use best record to determine home field advantage, not until the last couple of years.",baseball
Dude baseball is a constant shit show from the home ump it feels like. I'm a dude who hates it when people berate umps or refs but the fact that a home plate ump can toss a guy for complaining about a strike call is really dumb. They really have to find another form of discipline than ejection.,baseball
"It’s always worse in sports subreddits around championship time. But in general this “everyone’s an expert” phenomenon proliferates on reddit, where comments are upvoted because they espouse popular views that aren’t necessarily correct or even reasonable. 

On this call, the interference wasn’t intentional or flagrant, and only came into being by way of a bad throw, all of which militate against making the call. But on the other hand, he was over the line and by the letter of the rules it was clear interference. How Reddit can simultaneously call for robo-umps to objectify an inherently subjective aspect of the game, while rallying against an ump making a call in line with the objective rules, is beyond me.",baseball
"A 100%.

When you get trucked, there's usually several things you can point to that led to it, or even just say that it wasn't meant to be. Pitch didn't have it, bats stayed cold, errors, other team just seeing your pitcher well, it's always lots of things.

Losing a tight game is more devastating because you can often point to one or two specific things, one particular pitch, where you lost it. If that one thing hadn't happened, maybe you win.",baseball
"I sent a text to a few friends last year after the Astros were up in game 2 against Boston. Said We may not lose a game this entire postseason, I don’t think we had a lead after that. I’m not allowed to text or say anything about the Astros this year.",baseball
"That's just crazy, Alien..Greg is an actual Fox announcer and he had to cheat to watch it? I work in IT in Hospitals and I dont think any of them get FS1 either. Same for most office buildings and nursing homes I've wired up..

Our Yankees/Astros series was a nail biter between two 100+ game winners and a ton of people couldn't watch the chaos because of this nonsense.",baseball
"This is a good take and I agree with you about “stars” and “titles”....but please look at the 09 and 11 drafts...it wasn’t luck that the warriors got curry and Thompson...but horrible scouting and projections for the players taken before them...that’s why some teams are almost always in the lottery, and haven’t won anything....full credit is deserved for the player development, scouting and player moves that filled those teams out, and everything lined up perfectly for them.",baseball
"I have a horrible memory for this stuff, but I remember this game so well. It was being hyped up as a pitchers duel and it’s all anyone talked about before the game, but that couldn’t prepare me for what actually happened. I typically love a high scoring game and hate those low scoring games, but it was the most fun game to watch.",baseball
"Dynasties always end earlier than expected. But it's not like the Athletics shouldn't be selling their future. Because it's the most exciting it has been in years.

Manaea, Montas, Puk, Luzardo is a great young pitching staff with young great position players like Olson, Chapman, Semien, Murphy, Laureano. Khris Davis and Profar are still in the fold. I think they can make some noise in the division going forward.",baseball
"It's purely a repetition thing. Player's whole lives growing they've seen righties a ton in every stop along the way, from little league, to high School, to the minors and beyond. They get a lot more practice and are a lot more used to it than a lefty is against a lefty pitcher.",baseball
Baseball should take a page out of tennis. If you don’t like the umpire’s call you can challenge and the robo tracker is shown on the big screen. I believe cricket is doing somewhat the same. Strikes and balls are a bit more complex but with good use of technology it can be perfected. I really think MLB is going about this the wrong way.,baseball
"As I told my wife a couple days ago - I am very sad that baseball is finishing up, but I also am excited to have 3-4 hours back every day to not be at the very least distracted checking up on a score every few minutes.

fundamental base running isnt the issue with the people I commented on. the problem is people on this sub think baseball players should give 100% on every single play which is borderline ridiculous. it isn’t about him giving up a base..  what could be a double for most may only be a single for zim. so is it fair to say oh zim is slow and wouldn’t have got to 2nd even if he had ran 100% out the box. i’ve watched zim play for many years as well and i’ve seen him almost walk down the line on a ground ball.,baseball
"See, I don't agree that he has done so with frequency. I've seen him in action many times and he's usually pretty tuned in, but that quote obviously doesn't sound great. But as a pitcher, I honestly didn't mind giving the occasional free pass to a less than stellar baserunner who could hit the cover off the ball.",baseball
"The original Rob Arthur article doesn't just look at expected HRs based on exit velo and launch angle. He also measured the difference in speed of fastballs right after they're thrown and right when they get to the plate to measure how much drag the balls have. He's found that drag to be much higher in the playoffs, and that shouldn't be related to quality of pitching at all.",baseball
"If Turner takes one step out of his path yesterday, he is out as he wouldn't have beaten the ball to the bag. Why would the rule be discriminatory to right handed batters (who have to alter their path) when lefties are already in the ""running lane"" when they leave the box?

Give the right handed hitters ""more bag"" to run to, so they can still run a relatively straight line and not have to heavily alter their path.",baseball
"Plays at first are so close that even veering 2 feet could change a lot of calls

Edit since this guy keeps deleting his comments...

It’s a silly thing to suggest that altering your path away from a direct line is the same as running a direct line. I don’t have the time to go through math of it but not only are you adding time by taking an extra step you’re also losing your forward momentum. All of this is a minute difference sure but even if it’s 0.01 seconds difference that changes hundreds of calls a year. How many times have we watched a ball beat the foot to the bag when the runners foot is an inch above the bag? It happens all the time. Yes it’s a small difference in terms of time to the bag but if you think beyond that one thing you’ll realize it’s a big difference in the game and many safe/out calls

Even Turner’s play last night was a perfect example. Had the ball been caught, he looked safe to me but it was so close that I don’t know. If he has to veer in any way because of a rule there’s no question he’s out if the ball is caught.",baseball
"The Saints-Rams game would have been a rare case of an NFL game where they probably could have figured out the logistics if part of the game had to be replayed. It wouldn't be possible most of the time, because it would interfere with teams preparing for the following week's game. Imagine a team playing a protested game on Sunday, finishing the game on Monday, and then playing a full game on Thursday. 

Also, how much of the game could be replayed? If it's just the last few minutes it's one thing, but what if the egregious misapplication of the rules occurred in the 1st half? They'd probably still finish out the game before anyone rules on the protest, so you could have a situation where a team playing a Thursday game plays over 2.5 games of football in a span of 5 days.",baseball

"I get it that you can't score only three runs in three home games and win, but there is a case that the game shifted last night on five very inconsistent pitch calls, all pitched to the outside against RH batters. Four went against the Nats, one against the Astros.

* Bottom 2nd, 1st and 3rd, no outs, Zimmerman batting, 0-0 count. Cole's first pitch is a FB just slightly outside the traditional zone, called a strike. The favorable count sets Cole up to throw his breaking balls that Zim just flails at, 1st out.

* Bottom 2nd, 1st and 3rd, one out, Robles batting, 0-0 count. First pitch fastball by Cole is also outside, maybe a little bit more than the Zim pitch but called a strike. Cole switches to breaking balls, gets a DP, rally over.

I don't think Nats fans can complain about either the calls here, but at this point you want to say OK, Barksdale has established his zone for the game. The Robles strike was not a strike the majority of the time but the Zim one was close enough that you could say, as long as he's consistent it will all be fine. But then...

* Top 4th, one on, two outs, Correa batting, 0-2 count. [This pitch from Ross](https://twitter.com/TGerbracht/status/1188628390191996928) is closer to a strike than either the Zim or Robles called strikes but it's called a ball, and Correa hits a HR four pitches later. If Ross gets the call, the game remains 2-0 and Ross remains a potential hero.

* Bottom 7th, none on, two outs, 4-1 score, Zim batting after the Soto HR, 3-2 count. The ball four call on Cole is marginal - it's a strike by 3rd inning standards, and it's a ball by 4th inning standards. Maldonado and Cole both do the fake-out walk to the dugout, get called back, and Maldonado complains to Barksdale about it. So the next batter...

* Bottom 7th, one on, two outs, 3-2 count on Robles. [This strike call](https://twitter.com/Mounir_Laassili/status/1188647765418696704) ended the final rally chance the Nats had and is clearly the worst call of the five, and is most likely a makeup call from Maldonado complaining about the missed ball four. If Robles walks there, Cole is out of the game and you likely would get a warmed-up Joe Smith to face Yan Gomes, who is [3-6 lifetime against Smith with 2 HRs](http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/batvspitch/_/id/28729/joe-smith).

"We don’t have much maintenance with snow. It just melts the next day or two. Maybe sticks around a few days twice a year and one really bad two weeks every five years. But it is mostly a constant freeze - thaw cycling - which has its own problems. 

The area is mixed with the whole social issues. But that probably means people actually have more room to make a difference. We have some great institutions that are working hard to improve things and real leadership. Also we have plenty of people around complaining about snowflakes. 

More generally politically it is a bit -maybe provincial is the word. People stay in their lane. And they are fine with X area 5 miles away a doing things very differently because that is X area. People don’t try to make a every “neighborhood” like there own. So there is a lot of variety in communities. And any tensions don’t really spread through the are like you would think they might. But it isn’t really neighborhoods. There are like over 80 separate municipalities in a place that would normally a single city government any where else in the country (oddity of 1876 politics called the Great Divorce). I mean over 80 separate mayors and city councils - almost half have there own police dept. and they all have their own courts. So it is a metro that feels like living in a much smaller community. Change takes slower to spread, but it gets a firmer hold when it does. But there are also some funny in/out groups that are not along the lines you would ever think.",baseball
"&gt; ALL of Manfred's tinkering doesn't materially affect the pace of play

Things that Manfred has done to address pace of play:

 - Cut down mound visits
 - Pitch Clock (coming next year)
 - No more one-and-done pitching changes (coming next year)

Mound visits are definitely a pace of play issue, because you would have a tense situation where things are moving and then suddenly we'd take a full stop and wait for the catcher to run out, take as long as they want, then come back. The limits on those have definitely paid dividends in having less random catcher visits to the mound.

I'd argue pitching changes are also a pace of play issue. There's a difference between expected downtime and surprise down time. Post-scoring commercial break in football is expected, injury delay is not. Similarly, between inning break is expected, pitching change is not, and then when you get the starter walks first guy, pitching change, lefty on lefty warning track fly, pitching change, righty gets the rest of the inning - that's definitely more of a pace issue for viewers than just total game time.",baseball

"Your post was removed because it violates rule [**2.07 Home Run Highlights**](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/wiki/rules#wiki_2.07_home_run_highlights).

In order for a home run to be considered worthy of its own highlight, it must fulfill at least one of the following criteria:

* Stats-verifiable ""monster shot"" - extreme distance traveled, exit velocity, or otherwise a statistical outlier

* Context-important homer - for example, a first game back from injury, a homer by a player who rarely homers (like a pitcher), or a 3+ HR game

* Game-changing homer - breaking up a no-hitter, a grand slam, a walk-off homer, etc.

* Milestone homer - record-tying or breaking homers, big-number milestones (think multiples of 100, not 10), etc.

* ""That's baseball, Suzyn"" homer - inside-the-parkers, a homer off the top of someone's head, a homer into the bullpen trash can, etc.

All home run posts must include a description in the post title of why the home run is interesting or important. If you feel that your post *does* meet these criteria, you might just need to re-post it with a better title.

What's kind of interesting is that at the time it wasn't a big deal. I mean, us blowing a 2-run lead with 2 outs and nobody on base in the 10th inning of the potential clinching game of the World Series was a humongous deal and everybody was extremely heartbroken (I was a toddler and didn't witness it personally), but Buckner wasn't immediately blamed as the goat of the Series, and he wasn't booed...

The Red Sox held a parade *after they lost* the World Series in 1986 and apparently 750,000 people showed up, which is pretty cool. It's a weird mix of celebration and mutual comforting.

Add in the fact that we are in MAY and I just don't think we are gonna be contending for the world series title in October. I mean the mariners started out hot too, look where they are now. 

I just will believe we are for real when it is after the draft, after the deadline, and we are already printing the division champions hats and alcs appearance shirts. 

Like does anyone here think the twins are world series contenders? Did anyone predict this? Does anyone think someone like cj cron or jonathan schoop or pineda are gonna be postseason mvps, versus the all stars some other teams have? 

Anyone? That is all my point is lol. Like we are obviously over-performing right now, after playing in a notoriously weak division and coming off many games against the mariners, orioles, and blue jays. Hardly some vaunted teams we are beating.

To be fair, though, Rovell seems to be a terrible athlete.",baseball
"If you think a touch equals a step or it being considered down then you’re arguing just to argue.

This comes down to being subjective. Call me obtuse all you want but that makes no sense because you are just as adamant on your position so the same could be said of you.

What Doolittle did was not a step. It’s just not. Twist and reinterpret the definition all you want but it won’t make you right. 

Bottom line: if MLB does consider this illegal, then the rule needs to be changed. Cause it certainly is not the same as what Edwards did and is not a stop and re-start motion.",baseball

"The Nationals need to make a big trade or they’re going to have to tear it down in the future, I think. Doesn’t mean Rendon necessarily but they got to do something. And next offseason they shouldn’t try to plug all their holes by bargain shopping. Rosenthal and Barraclough were projects and Hellickson, Sanchez and Sipp were coming off a major outlier of a year. Dozier was a bounce-back candidate. Get reliable, proven talent that isn’t washed up or coming off a season-ruining injury.",baseball
"Yeah....just realized this while thinking it over in the shower.  Usually on pop-ups the batter-runner gets to first before the pop up is dropped.  In that case, the best you can do is forcing out the runner at second.  This batter was an idiot and stopped running.  So he screwed himself and his teammate, leading to a double play.

The lesson, kids, RUN TO FIRST BASE",baseball
"I got chills and that feeling like I wanted to cry. Jake the Snake was an absolute beast for the Cubbies. Just the type of guy you want on your team. I was really bummed after learning he wasn't coming back.

Still my favorite memory is the WC game against Pittsburgh in 2015. Complete game, 11 strikeouts. People forget about the 2015 Cubs playoffs (for obvious reasons) but that game + taking down the Cards in the NLDS was awesome to watch.",baseball

That’s exactly my point. He barely pitched in Spring training and has only been game ready his past couple starts.

"I don't disagree that sample size is king.  However, one year is a really big sample, and I can't understand why you won't acknowledge this. 
 
Just look at the stabilization rates for hitting: obp stabilizes in 460 PA, SLG in 320, ISO in 160.  Granted, batting average, BABIP and batted ball profile stats take longer (especially batted ball profile stats - those can take years to stabilize), but the vast majority of metrics stabilized a long time ago for these two players and comparisons would certainly be statistically relevant.  

I hadn't considered it before this ridiculous hot take thread, but now I'm genuinely curious if a case can be made for Yelich being the current best hitter.  Probably not - most projection models have Trout outperforming him by a wide margin (because, as you say, he has such a deep record of excellence).  But I plan to look into it further.",baseball
"Yeah, that’s why I mentioned Dombrowski who went out of his way to not strengthen the pen. I asked a Sox fan friend of mine this long question: “While the Sox bullpen hasn’t been terrible by any means, at least not until the last few games, was Porcello being left in the game an inning too long simply a question of Cora leaving him in because he was pitching well? Or did he question taking Porcello out because he is not 100% confident in his bullpen and that led him to leave Porcello on the mound, Grady Little style? In other words, with a better bullpen, does Cora fall back on taking out the starter around 7th inning, 85-90ish pitches?”",baseball

Fernando was a bit before my time, but he's also a great icon for fat guys everywhere.",baseball
"That part hit me really hard. I look back at how I learned to play when I was little, and it all started with my dad. He’d come home from work and we’d play catch for an hour before bed.

Or it started with catch. We played catch for a month, and then one day, he brought home a bat and said “Now this time, I’m going to throw the ball to you, and you’re going to swing and try to hit it.” So we worked on contact for a couple weeks.

Then one day, he brought home three bases. He said “From now on, this works like tag. If I have the ball and I touch you with it, you’re out. But these bases are the safe spots; you can’t be tagged out if you’re touching one.” So we worked on baserunning.

How to get outs, how the count worked, how runs worked, position players, runners, all those pieces slowly got bolted on to the experience one by one over the course of a year. It wasn’t baseball to me yet, just something that me and my dad did together — and, as far as little me knew, something that every father and son shared. I didn’t realize that what I was playing was baseball until I watched the Cardinals play on TV — and realized that baseball was the name of the game I was playing and took active interest.",baseball

You can say what you will about last year’s success, but they’ve been on top for the last three years and they’ve only improved their roster. If it weren’t for the outlier 6 - 13 start (largely due to Cora’s bird brained spring training regiment) this wouldn’t even be a conversation.",baseball
"First of all, the idea that umps get it wrong, but are consistent about it is simply daft. It's just random and arbitrary.

I watched an AB by Rowdy Tellez today where he took a pitch 5 inches off the plate for a called strike, a second pitch 4 inches off the plate for a ball, and a 3rd pitch 7 inches off the plate for another strike, and let me assure you I didn't find it the least bit beautiful.",baseball

"I mean, I remember the game, but I don't remember manager moves or non-moves that would have contributed to the implosion.

Unless you're suggesting that the Yankees beforehand were just like: ""ok,  we're gonna lose but first we're going to put up 7 runs and lead with 2 outs in the 9th and throw the game like that""

The narrative of ""the Yankees threw the game"" doesn't make sense when looking at the actual game.",baseball
"AI was one of the most naturally athletic players ever. His career also completely fell of a cliff quickly around age 30 and he was a clubhouse distraction on mediocre teams. He thrived as a volume shooter, in his MVP year he shot 40%. That's... not great. He wouldn't be anywhere near as well received with that game in today's game. 

I like AI, but people remember him as a better player than he probably was, and it had nothing to do with his natural talent. (His highlight reel is as fun to watch as anything in sports, IMO).",baseball

"Right now hitting, especially home run hitting, is too dominant. We need to shift the advantage back toward pitching. That can be done by increasing the size of the strike zone or raising the mound. Of the two, raising the mound would mainly just result in more strikeouts, which are already high.",baseball
"Last I read was in Baseball Prospectus that the concept of hitting anyone behind anyone else to drive them in is overrated. The most efficient thing to do is just hit your players in descending order of goodness to make sure your best hitters get the most ABs. Every spot in the lineup is worth something like 12 plate appearances over the course of the season, so by hitting your best hitter 1 instead of 3 you're giving them 20+ more chances to hit.

No one does that though. Maybe someone will start. I used to think Openers were too crazy for the game but now we're here.",baseball
"Your post was removed because it violates rule [**2.07 Home Run Highlights**](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/wiki/rules#wiki_2.07_home_run_highlights).

In order for a home run to be considered worthy of its own highlight, it must fulfill at least one of the following criteria:

* Stats-verifiable ""monster shot"" - extreme distance traveled, exit velocity, or otherwise a statistical outlier

* Context-important homer - for example, a first game back from injury, a homer by a player who rarely homers (like a pitcher), or a 3+ HR game

* Game-changing homer - breaking up a no-hitter, a grand slam, a walk-off homer, etc.

* Milestone homer - record-tying or breaking homers, big-number milestones (think multiples of 100, not 10), etc.

* ""That's baseball, Suzyn"" homer - inside-the-parkers, a homer off the top of someone's head, a homer into the bullpen trash can, etc.

All home run posts must include a description in the post title of why the home run is interesting or important. If you feel that your post *does* meet these criteria, you might just need to re-post it with a better title.

"Yea, Mize was seen as a mid first rounder.  He just put on a show his draft eligible year.  Adley has been pegged for 1.1 since his sophomore year of college.  Honestly, I don't think anyone has come close to knocking him off, he has been in his own tier for over a year.  Amazing that he improved on his incredible sophomore year, especially since he is being pitched around so much.  And thankfully we have competent people in place.  Wasn't just Sid and Mike that came over from Houston.",baseball

"depends on where the Nashville AAA team is located. If they pick up an affiliate that already has a AAA team, then the AAA team goes off somewhere else.

Like, if Nashville's AAA team is in Memphis (which has some perception downsides).. then the Cardinals AAA team could move to Springfield, MO (where the Cardinals AA team is located) and the Cardinals could move their AA team to somewhere else in the Texas League sphere (moving the AA team 70 miles west to Joplin might undercut a little bit of the attendance for a Springfield AAA team).",baseball

"Really didn’t expect this. But this is big. Keller is no. 18 on MLB prospect list, has absolutely electric stuff. 65 grade fastball (sits 97-98 with great control) and also has a solid curve and change. Apparently also developed a slider too. Keep your eyes out

"You say best interest, but I don't think you or the Cubs know what the hell is best.

Let's think this through... Yes, they got a great deal. However, there is more money in a NATIONAL broadcast than a local one. And the Cubs' fan base is the size it is because it was aired NATIONALLY all the time.

Yes, right now it's a good deal. Long-term, though, it isn't. Those national viewers bought merchandise. They visited and went to games. They spent money on the team. Short term, those are still fans. Realistically, though, people are leaving Chicago and becoming fans of teams local to them. That is LOST REVENUE. And it's more than the television deal, especially when ad revenue dips and people tune in less or are unwilling to pay for the channel.

People are leaving cable, so it makes even more sense to go back to WGN and keep a national fanbase.",baseball

"When’s the last time you went to a cage? 

I’d be willing to bet (short of you losing or gaining lots of weight) your swing is still the same as it always was. 

65mph BP seems pretty fair imo. I’d be willing to bet you would find that contact came back very quickly. From there it’s just reps. 

Also right field at Fenway is 302ft, my right field was 315. 

I’d be willing to bet you could hit one out in 50 cuts as well. (My assertion here isn’t that I’m “good” it’s that assuming you haven’t let your body go to shit, and you still have band eye coordination nothing has changed. For most players who didn’t see play past high school they are probably stronger now than they were then)

This is called “defensive indifference” and it doesn’t count as a stolen base. The defensive team lets the offense do this because it makes more strategic sense for them to remain in standard defensive positioning then to try and hold the runners on when the runs they represent are not the difference makers.,baseball

"The Royals broadcasters have talked about how his batting stance was changing as he struggled at the plate and how different it is now.

In a nutshell, as he struggled he started hunching more and more. Late last year he went more upright, and this year he is almost entirely vertical and moved his hands out from his body. I would say those were good adjustments.",baseball
"The strike zone is a clearly defined area per player: 

The official strike zone is the area over home plate from the midpoint between a batter's shoulders and the top of the uniform pants -- when the batter is in his stance and prepared to swing at a pitched ball -- and a point just below the kneecap. In order to get a strike call, part of the ball must cross over part of home plate while in the aforementioned area.

These points can all be clearly defined.",baseball
"I’m pretty sure it still depends. If the score is close and runners are in base or reach, they go from the stretch. If the closer’s team is up by three or more with no more than one runner on (or maybe even still), the pitcher will probably stick with the windup",baseball

"It doesn't change the meaning.  Either way you take the quote, he looks at pitching as a positional player as inconsequential and therefore he doesn't care about how well he does.  There is no pressure to perform and thus has no reason to care.  He's just there to try to get three outs.  If he doesn't, it's no skin off of his bones.

"Homeruns. Strikeouts. Errors.

I dislike this emphasis on homers because it’s forcing people to whiff on nearly every pitch on an attempt to do so. I’d rather have someone be a .300+ hitter with some pop than .220 hitter with 50 home runs. If you’re someone like Yelich or Bellinger, that’s even better.",baseball
"It's a throwback to the SNES/Genesis game ""[Roger Clemens MVP Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Clemens%27_MVP_Baseball).  Since Clemens was the only person associated with the MLB to license the game, everything else about it is fake.  He pitched for the ""Boston Crabs"".

"Yeah I deliberately said maybe for that reason, I wasn't sure about it myself when watching the game but the fact that they just didn't even review it was infuriating. Especially given how bad the calls were in innings prior. It sounded like the pitch might have hit him live, just because it did have a different sound than a regular pitch in the dirt. The video evidence was obviously murky but no review is just insulting.

It was a pretty even series, the 1st game the Yankees offense was bad in their approach at free swinging but Greinke was also on, so that allowed him to go as long as he did and to dominate even with 20+ pitches thrown in the 1st inning. The second game was close but as I already said it seemed like every time they were coming back that they were having rallies killed by horrible umpiring. The thing that hurt the most was 0 runs in that 5th inning and the bases were left loaded to end it, with a proper overturned call at 2nd it's very likely at least 1 run scores.",baseball

Probably not quite, but he’s never gonna quit giving us amazing highlights in CF.",baseball
"I'm always confused as to how the Twins always seem to make him look like an average hitter against our pitching.

I mean, he slashes .275/.402/.471 against us cause we've walked him 28 times in 169 plate appearances, but I'd take that all day considering some of the numbers he puts up against other teams.",baseball
"Guy's on fire. Super fun when a call up just goes crazy to start their career. He also had a double that missed being a home run by about 1/2 a centimeter in his second game. It was seriously kind of weird that one didn't bounce over. Would have been 4 in his first 6 games. Not to mention the crazy streak he was on in the minors before his call up, like you mention.

His swing's got serious power, and his consistent hitting this past week has been a huge difference maker for the Braves.",baseball
