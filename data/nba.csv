"&gt;Using physical violence because of some stupid words is retarded and fascist. If someone says something you don’t like just ignore it. It’s really that simple. Only speech I am against is calls to violence. Which this sub is jerking off over. Which is not surprising. This sub is mostly white 18 year olds. 

Reacting to a massacre with the language of that politician was the only facist thing that happened. It really is that simple. His speech was facist and someone cracked a fucking egg on his head. Mate, it's a fucking egg, you're acting like the kid went in there and killed 50 people and then /r/NBA was celebrating it.. no, that's what the politician was doing. Specifically calling out the victims of the violence and saying they don't belong. I don't make assumptions about the people who support that kind of facist racist language, I think they cut across age, so I won't profile you

I'm thirsty, so I range until I find one of the Mothermounds, and there I suckle at a teatpatch until I've had my fill of milk.

You're telling me the defense is better with Giannis off for real?~~ Stats can be taken with a grain of salt sometimes. Harden is a pretty solid post defender.

It just seems that without Harden the rockets aren't really shit, especially this season when CP3, Capela, and Gordon were hurt for an2+ month period. Meanwhile if the Bucks season went on without Gianni's this year I think they still make the playoffs. That's why Harden is my MVP.",nba

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.

People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.

The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.

Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.

And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.

Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.

So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.

You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.

This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.

So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?",nba
"I would disagree. 2008 - 2010 imo are his finest years. Thats what I saw as his peak years in terms of combined physical and mental skills. Kobe played like a madman in 2012 for sure, but you can tell he was worn down and making plays through sheer will",nba

"He's averaging for the most part what he has been for his entire career and better than what he has been for the past few years in certain categories. His numbers are as good this year as the year her won in Cle.

Not too many candidates really.  I'd say the only play that comes close would be his elbow jumper against the Spurs game 7 in 2013 to put them up 4 or 5 with like 30 seconds to go.  That magnitude of the moment is hard to replicate in any other setting.  ,nba
"I am in complete agreement with you here, it would be better for him (and his image) to not get into playoffs rather than getting �� by warriors.

But I honestly don’t even see anything happening for Lakers this summer, so it’s not gonna make much difference next season if Warriors manage to keep the personnel.

P.S. - if nuggets get the top seed at the end and Lebron’s Lakers face them. Tell me you honestly don’t think Lebron’s Lakers can win 4 against them?

But I am quite certain if Marvin Bagley comes back healthy, Lakers don’t even get to the 9th spot �� ",nba
"Meaning is subjective.

I have a ride til I die team in football and I wouldn't do that to myself in any other sports that I got into later because of how stressful it is for me when they aren't doing well. Being more open allows you to enjoy good basketball on the same level without being upset another team beat yours or having that bias creep in. Also you don't have to deal with what the Lakers kids are going through right now.

I have players I like and since Giannis is my favorite and I collect his memorabilia I guess Bucks are the closest I have atm to a favorite team but I have a cluster of teams I enjoy following a bit more than the others, Bucks, Blazers, Nuggets, Kings, Jazz, Spurs, Raptors. Maybe I do prefer smallish market teams though I dunno. Still it allows me to be excited when teams like the Sixers are on the upswing or when the FA shuffle happens seeing where Kawhi goes or what happens with AD without being upset if AD did go to the Lakers or if Kawhi rolls in to LAC instead of staying with the Raps.

I feel like locking yourself in to one team as a hardcore fan is fine but to me it's kind of like saying ""I like cheeseburgers  and only cheeseburgers and that's all I am gonna eat as long as I live."" You don't get to experience tasty pizza or Korean food that other people do.

"I mean, obviously right now that is true, but if the game actually implemented that rule, 30 years from now you might have guys that have trained their entire lives to hit 6-pointers. You don't have to hit them at the same rate as 3s, just enough to break even.

"I honestly don’t think the Bulls were down with trading for Wiggins. The bulls whole M.O. was to get more athletic, and they had been connected with LaVine for years. They had tried to trade Butler for LaVine and the chance to draft Dunn the year prior, but then when LaVine got hurt they traded their pick for the rights to markkanen as well as those two. 

I know it’s a joke to make fun of GarPax, and I know people love to talk about how they brought in Wade and rondo after talking about getting younger, but those were not longterk deals and were done after failing to move jimmy for younger players as a last ditch effort to build some form of team around jimmy for that one season. 

About a year after the trade this rumor starts going around, but it really doesn’t make much sense the bulls would suddenly have been interested in Wiggins when they had been gunning for LaVine since passing on him in the draft for McDermott. ",nba

"How many of those guys were HOF players without Bill?

* They had a losing record when Bill Russell was out.
* A lot of the other HOF players were scorers and Boston's offence wasn't actually that efficient. Their scorers were propped up by Bill making them look better than they were. 
 1. They scored a lot of points because Bill pioneered the fastbreak offence, pushing the pace up to an extreme level so the team had a high point average (their pace was ~20-30 points higher than the rest of the league). They led the league in FGs, but only because they massively led the league in FGA.
 2. On the other end of the court, Bill was crippling teams with his defence so those teams weren't able to benefit from the higher pace. 

 On the surface, it looked like Boston's players were having all these high scoring games and playing well and outshooting their opponents. In reality, they were a bottom 3rd offensive team being propped up almost entirely by Bill Russell.
* When you look at Boston, before/during/after Bill Russell it looks like this:
 * Immediately Before: Boston never made it out of the conference 
 * During: 11 championships in 13 years 
 * Immediately After: Lottery Team for the next two seasons.


They were a below average offensive team and without Bill they were a below average defensive team too.

"If it worked so well, why have they moved away from what they were doing last year?

Harden's regressed on defense - not quite to what he was before Paul joined, but definitely worse than last season. There's less ball movement, fewer plays for everybody except Harden and Paul. And the whole team just looks less intense on defense - less focused.

And to have them fall from first place in the league all the way to ten games back of that right now with it looking like that's about where they'll finish or worse.

The Rockets have their two best players still, the ones they based the entire team around, and they still look decidedly worse.

Given Harden's playoff history, I'd say it's a whole lot more likely that he was on a team that was overachieving for one year, that needed an injury to one of the Warriors most important defenders to win two games by a grand total of 6 points and that Chris Paul had to play so hard to get those two wins that he injured himself.

"&gt; When Boogie went down they were 27-21 which is 46 win pace and they finished with 48 wins

They went 21-13 without him. 56% W/L with Boogie, 61% without. His last game was game 48. They were 17-11 (also 61) with Mirotic putting up lesser numbers than Randle has been putting up since November in the same minutes. 

More, actually. Miro averaged 29 mpg, Randle was already outperforming him before he got the extra 4-5 boost to 30. 

Same points, more rebounds, more assists, equal efficiency. Randle even has the same D rating as AD this year. 

&gt; I open that link and see he's averaging 20ppg for the season, ~23 in Feb and ~24 in March, season highs in minutes. (and based on the eye test, season highs in reddit hype). USG rate is joint highest in Feb and March (next highest is Oct when he was playing much fewer minutes and more or less purely working as a bench scorer).

How is any of this an argument against my point that Randle was undeniably at least equalling (really surpassing) Miro’s production?

You said his numbers were inflated by AD sitting and them tanking, when he was putting up 20 &amp; 9 months before AD went public. 

That’s plainly not true. He’s been producing at the same rate all year. 

&gt; Mirotic still had the higher Offensive rating for the season (117 to 115) 

Don’t see this anywhere. Must be missing it. 

As far as the ‘fit’ argument, you’ll have no argument from me there. Last year’s team (post-Boogie injury) was much better constructed than this team. 

But there are other poorly constructed teams with worse rosters (Clippers, Spurs, Minnesota, Dallas) that have been better than them all year. 

Dallas is only below them now that they’re in full tank mode. 

&gt; You've got AD missing ~25% of the games this season vs ~8% last season,

He missed 12 games before the deadline, and I don’t think they’ve ever been above the 10th seed at any point. It matters, obviously, but it’s not like it’s season derailing. 

This isn’t an argument that AD’s situation is good. I’m only saying that it’s good enough to beat the Kings, and the Mavs, and the Wolves, and maybe the Spurs. 

They should’ve been pushing for a spot (tho I wouldn’t ever bet on them over the Spurs making it) if he is what everyone says he is, or Gentry should be fired for gross incompetence.  ",nba

"&gt;Since they've been together, Curry has a higher PPG and is more efficient. 

You're splitting hairs, because 1). this isn't even true for the playoffs 2). he has a higher ppg by like 0.9 points over that stretch. 

&gt;I saw some of your other posts about TS% but I kinda get the feeling you don't totally understand the stat. It is just points divided by shot attempts (with a little bit of guesswork around fouls, but that doesn't matter here). 

Well you'd be kinda wrong, because your explanation is exactly what I've been saying this whole time. TS% and eFG are *composites*, meaning they include all shot attempts from every spot on the floor. This will automatically skew towards 3s, because a three gives you more points per shot. 

&gt;The way you're trying to break this down would be like calling Shaq inefficient because his FG% outside of the paint was bad.

No you absolute pine cone, this is what you and everyone using this tortured logic are doing in trying to call Steph a better scorer than KD. KD takes far more shots from mid range and at the basket AND he's more efficient at it. You people are effectively punishing him because he doesn't take as many threes. 

All you're doing is demonstrating why using these stats by themselves are inefficient ways of deciding whose the best at what. 

&gt;You can still argue that KD is the better overall scorer if you think his better shot variety outweighs Steph's higher efficiency and marginally higher PPG, but that is separate from saying KD is more efficient than Steph. 

I never said he was more efficient than Steph, I said he's a better shooter from every spot besides behind the arc. Which is true. He takes twice as many shots as Steph right at the basket and is more efficient. ",nba

"&gt;But you, by presenting SYRIZA as a radical far left insurgency group

I will only tell you to look up what SYRIZA means and tell me if it's me who presents them as a radical left party or it's the party's name itself. I am not talking about the era after which most far left elements left the party, I am talking about that point in time where people voted for them; it was supposed to be a far left party consisted of communists or even anarchists in some cases.

I am saying that about SYRIZA because by your logic, if every person who voted for the far right is a fascist / racist, then every person who voted for the far left should be a communist / anarchist. I didn't say they are. I am following your logic to prove to you that neither of those are true. A person might vote for a party because they like a specific aspect of what it brings, or they're just naive and misguided.

Promises to punish corrupt politicians? A young prime minister unlike the previous ones who promises to erase the national debt? No alternative / nothing better to vote for? Potential for personal gain - a.k.a. please find me a job? I mean, ideology in modern society is not even the most important factor for a person's decision when it comes to elections. Do you think people who used to vote for the previous ""leftist"" party that was governing Greece were leftists themselves?

So we shouldn't consider people who voted for the far right party to be racists. They are stupid for sure, not necessarily racists though. I have talked to people who have voted for the far right party and are best friends with people from Albania. You know what that means in Greece. Others who were voting for the Communist Party and voted for the Golden Dawn party. I mean, people are stupid, you can't expect their choices to reflect their true ideology.

From my experience, having lived in various countries and travelled to more than 20, Greece as a whole is one of the most hospitable countries I have seen / lived in and the vast majority of its people are more polite and friendly than others. Sure, there are brain-dead people everywhere, Greece included, who hate anything that doesn't look / sound like themselves. But to say Greece is a racist cesspool is a reach, to say the least. European countries in general do not have the same level of ""tolerance"" and understanding for different races / religions / any kind of minorities as the States but that's the outcome of entirely different circumstances developing throughout the last centuries in those two continents (Europe - America).

&gt;Again, you don t just start doing the nazi salute one day or actually proceeding to kill an immigrant just because he s an immigrant. Or start weaving swastika flags left and right.

No, you don't. And people who do that are not 6% of the Greeks. They aren't even 2%. It's the core of the Golden Dawn party. Similar extremist cores exist in every country throughout the world. You make it sound like Greece is any different, just because you are pissed that your fellow Greeks votes for that party - I mean, I understand your sentiment, but you are exaggerating here. Do you think there are no similar groups throughout Europe or America? What makes you think that that percentage is bigger in Greece?

Take a look at the States. Do you want me to send you pictures? Do you want me to go back some decades and show you how a really divided nation looks like? Take a look at Italy, Germany, France, Serbia, England, do you think Greece is the exception? Look at the latest polls there. Or the popularity of Lepen and AFD. It's the rule. And the rule is this: There are skinheads and Neo-Nazis everywhere, and there are haters and murderers everywhere. If anything, Greece is a mild case and at least  most of the people who resorted in voting for a far right party did that after severe austerity, poverty, loss of income and property, desperation. 

I am not saying they did well and I am not saying they are excused - fuck every racist scum. But try to understand the difference between a racist and someone desperate enough to vote for a party that promises to punish corrupt politicans and ""happens"" (in their eyes) to be racist.

* BI started off pretty disengaged, perhaps its fatigue from the previous few games. he's been playing a lot of minutes. but he finished strong and im glad to see that he's still being aggressive, we need it.
* kuz had a horrible game, points be damned. forced a lot of shots, was never in a rhythm. perhaps its having to match up with true bigs past few games, but when he's disengaged, he's not contributing much else. also one thing i notice is that, for losing a MUST WIN game to the WORST team in the league, he really doesnt seem like he's bothered too much. maybe im reading into it too much, but if he truly had the mamba mentality, i dont see kobe dabbing up the other team after a loss like this.
* bron tried hard this game, and before anyone thrashes him for the missed FTs, we wouldnt have made the comeback without him. its a give and take. truly - we never should have been in a position that bron has to make some FTs to even have an attempt to come back against the suns.
* rondo has been bad, i have no idea whats the fascination that luke has with him. he cant hit anything at this point, he doesnt actually run the offense that well (remember that last possession of the half?), and his defense is absolutely atrocious.
* mcgee had a good game statistically, but i really wish he would play with more brains. why foul booker out on the perimeter with a few seconds left? why goaltend two shots that may not go in? and tbh, and im glad he made those jump shots, but on a team with bron and BI being able to create, do we want to encourage those kind of plays? is that truly the best out of bounds play we could have gotten?
* luke again continues to disappoint me with the lineups. i remember BI driving in the lane (and making) a layup with FIVE guys in the paint. putting hart/rondo/any center out on the court and you're ASKING to have the paint packed, cuz no one can shoot. why does he keep playing these lineups? its truly baffling that with 20 games left in the season, this is the first time i actually saw him stagger BI and Bron's minute (only for a bit).

overall, this was the clincher. tbh, a bit of me wishes we didnt make the comeback - more wear and tear on bron, and now luke is gonna have positive things to say. i kind of wish we stayed down 19 to see the aftermath of losing by double digits to the WORST team in the nba.",nba
"Worst trade I've ever seen happen in the NBA, by far. Even if you can't afford to pay him over the summer as I've heard a couple of times, why trade someone that can help you NOW? Makes zero sense.

"Shit, this is a good question. Ultimately I go with Wade but I can be talked into AI. It sounds crazy but if you watched him you would know that AI would average 30 for multiple seasons in this era. Really one of the all time great scorers. Ultimately  I go with Wade because his defense puts him over the top. Wade in his prime could guard 1-3. That is a very valuable skill and gives you flexibility if your building a contender. It's easy to imagine offenses today putting AI to work because of his size and below-average defense. Like I said I could be talked into AI. Also, I do wonder if AI would have done better with the 2009 Heat than Wade did.",nba

When people think of Hakeem they usually think Hakeem from 1992-93 to 1994-95. Also, no other top 10 ever rely on just 3 straight years as legacy. I saw a person claiming Hakeem was just as good as Duncan at rebounding. I'm not saying he didn't reach that heights, but when he did which is pre Rudy T, he wasn't the Hakeem everyone tends to rank highly.
I believe Hakeem doesn't have a case against Bird, Magic, Russell, Shaq and Duncan for top 5. People can go ahead and talk about Hakeem vs. Shaq or Hakeem vs. Duncan. But what case Hakeem has against Bird?.. When you take away their best 3 straight season from any other names, they have something. Bird won 3 straight MVPs, before those he was already in the MVP race against Kareem, Moses and Erving. He led his team to a chip as a sophomore. He was All-NBA 1st as a rookie and made 1st team in those 4 seasons, not missing once. Post MVPs, people were tired to vote for him in the race... Every other names have some kind of this. Their legacy isn't just based on 3 seasons.

They essentially have the same roster as last season but with Westbrook being worse. I mean literally all his offensive stats are down from last year so whatever Shroder provides, it’s negated because of how much of a liability Westbrook can be. 

He is still a assist machine, but the problem is that there are not enough consistent shooters to pass the ball to.

I think it’s because the NBA has marketed their athletes much more and are more recognizable than the NFL players constantly wearing helmets.

"&gt;I know you’re getting downvoted

&gt;It makes sense for female rappers to sometimes rap about different subject matters than men. Women have different life experiences, which is what ultimately dictates an MC’s message and persona. But everything else about their craft is the same — beats, flows, culture, references, etc. There’s a reason the Grammys don’t separate awards by gender: male MCs can technically perform anything a female MC can, and vice versa.

I absolutely agree with this statement, but I think that overall you will still always find more comparisons between the two for your stated reason - the subject matter and things that are rapped about are quite commonly very similar. Even beats/flows I think have some cultural boundaries that will take time for women to break through (like I am not a huge fan of artists like Future, but I'd argue there's no female equivalent). So yeah, you definitely can compare Cardi and Drake but my point is that I don't think it will happen as often. Not due to sexism but moreso due to similarity between other female rappers.

"Please link me whatever scientific journal you’re getting this shit from because I’ve never read of a “minimum standard of beauty” before.

Yes, humans that are young, have smooth skin and well-proportioned bodies are, throughout human history, generally accepted as beautiful. The problem here is that that’s not entirely true from culture to culture, and a societies take on beauty changes from one time period to the other, and this kind of thing has been studied and researched to exhaustion. Beauty is intersubjective. 

There are some empirical measures that can be applied, but those measures must also go and be observed through a societal lens, which is entirely subjective. Moroccans have a different stand from Americans who have a different standard from the French who are a different standard from Nigerians. In America, White Americans definitely have a different standard of beauty from Black Americans, who again have a different standard of beauty from Latino Americans.

You know what else can affect someones perception of beauty? Money. So can power, influence, intelligence, etc. There are several psychological aspects that go into beauty that science itself cannot fully explain.

You know what the most common signifier of beauty is, throughout all cultures and societies? Youth, but more the *perception* of youth. If we really want to boil this down to it’s core, to our monkey brains someone who appears young indicates a high level of fertility, which instinctively gets us going. That’s why someone who’s 50 years old, but is plastic to her core still appears to be beautiful, she appears to be young and still fertile.

So, again, the minimum standards of beauty you must be talking are:
-Youthful in appearance

-Smooth skin

-Well proportioned body

Applying these to Ayesha:
-She has a very youthful appearance

-She appears to have incredibly smooth skin

-Her body is much more well proportioned than most, even despite the effects post-birth


So according to these generally accepted “minimum standards of beauty”, Ayesha Curry is a beautiful person.

I also don't think posing for pictures with African Americans is any indication he isn't a racist. I think his comments over the last decade are pretty clear evidence. I think the countless testimonials from people around him, including his own biographer, are pretty good examples. I think his refusal to condemn nazis and his rhetoric towards Mexican Americans, and Mexico in general, is pretty good evidence. I think him having been shown to refuse to rent to African Americans in the 70s leading to him being sued by the federal government in 1973 is pretty good indication. You pick and choose what evidence works for you. When I first set out to know the man Trump was I was open to both sides but the evidence is overwhelming. 

Trump is lying, racist, misogynistic, pathetic, narcissistic, moron and the sad part is none of that is remotely hyperbole, that language probably isn't strong enough. Fuck Trump.

Damian lillard shot 62% from the field, 71% from 3 on 7 shots and 100% from the free throw line and scored 40.pts and got a -16 because kevin love was torching whoever was guarding him

Saying ""it's the Lakers"" hasn't been a good thing since 2011-2012. Building a culture off of the past is fucking stupid and that's why we have these issues with nepotism today. The sooner they fucking realize this, the better. We're not some old money plantation owning family in the Antebellum south worried about their honor and ""good name""

We have been utter shit for the past 5 years. The name has already been ""tarnished"" with the tanking and disgusting excuse for basketball we have been subjected to. There's no saving face. There is only growth and strength and right now I haven't seen anything close to those two qualities from this organization.

"Copying my comment from [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/UtahJazz/comments/b0hekw/help_send_a_message_that_hatred_bigotry_and/eifzjo9/)

---

The actual quote that Westbrook claimed the banned guy said was corroborated by both a teammate, Patrick Patterson, and with evidence that the Jazz was able to acquire.  This means that the banned dude 1) knew what he said was fucked up, 2) knew he would face serious ramifications if the truth got out, and 3) lied and claimed to say ""ice on your knees"" to try to avoid facing consequences.  

The actual quote, as confirmed by Westbrook, Patterson, and the evidence acquired by the Jazz, is either:

&gt;1. ""get down on your knees like **you** used to"", or

&gt;2. ""get down on your knees like **you're** used to""

The first is implied racism because it incites feelings of black slaves being forced to the ground or to kneel before their white owners.  It's not overtly racist in and of itself, but after knowing that the dude tried to lie about what he said means that, if he said #1, it was racist speech.

The second is not racist, but rather homophobic.  It implies that Westbrook is homosexual, and is using that as an insult.  Similar to the issue of people using ""gay"" to say something is bad, the dude is using homosexuality as an insult, which is also hate speech.

If you just read the quote, you probably wouldn't understand the hullabaloo behind this whole thing, but it was clearly intended to be offensive for Russ to verbally threaten the guy and his wife.  Russ may be a curmudgeon but he doesn't just react like that for no reason.

Sorry, y'all aren't getting anything good from Boston. Plus, that core isn't even better than what the Lakers offered. Way worse.

2) Rudy diving to the hoop and using his long ass legs to set wide screen (This works very good in combination with Mitchell)  
3) Rubio seeing the Matrix.  
That's not a lot you need/can scheme against. Forcing Mitchell errors is the easiest scheme for the defense. So either we get another playmaker who's a scoring threat or we'll be very limited in our offensive capability long term. But Mitchell is doing the same scoring efficiency as LaVine on a playoff team. Do you think anyone pays attention in a film session against the Bulls? NAH!

"Understanding RAINN’s statistics
Sexual violence is notoriously difficult to measure, and there is no single source of data that provides a complete picture of the crime. On RAINN’s website, we have tried to select the most reliable source of statistics for each topic. The primary data source we use is the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which is an annual study conducted by the Justice Department. To conduct NCVS, researchers interview tens of thousands of Americans each year to learn about crimes that they’ve experienced. Based on those interviews, the study provides estimates of the total number of crimes, including those that were not reported to police. While NCVS has a number of limitations (most importantly, children under age 12 are not included), overall, it is the most reliable source of crime statistics in the U.S.

We have also relied on other Justice Department studies, as well as data from the Department of Health and Human Services and other government and academic sources. When assembling these statistics, we have generally retained the wording used by the authors. Statistics are presented for educational purposes only. Each statistic includes a footnote citation for the original source, where you can find information about the methodology and a definition of terms.",nba

okay.... heres your ELI5:

I'm suggesting that when considering what makes a player ""great"" offensively, some of the most important things to figure out would be how many points the player scores or helps others score and how efficiently he does it (If you can think of other things that are more important than those, please let me know).

Averaging over 28 points is typically considered 'good' (most guys can't do it).

Averaging over 7 assists is a similarly high standard for that stat.

Doing them both at the same time, displays a balance and 'all-around ability' that this search shows *has only been accomplished 26 times in the history of the Association.*

Appearing multiple times on this list should on its own prove that a player has more than one season of outstanding offensive production.

Adding in the sort to determine how efficiently a player does it reveals Harden's last 4 years have seen him doing it at an unprecedentedly high rate of efficiency.

"I think Barkley talks without being the most eloquent at times. He's a smart and understanding guy though. I think if you got an eloquent version of his real opinion it would be that he believes ""a lot of these guys are not really ""depressed."" They are just spoiled and don't really understand what they have. Also, there are some players who are actually depressed...and no amount of money cures that."" I think Barkley would agree with that. Its just like the regular population. Of course, Barkley, and the rest of us without money also need to understand that there are unique and highly specific situations that only come about with money that can lead to depression. That doesn't mean we need to feel sorry for rich people. There are highly unique and specific ways poor people be one depressed as well. The thing is though, the NBA has a chance to eliminate or reduce those reasons for their rich players. And its important to recognize those reasons and do something about them. Its not about comparing rich and poor. Its about eliminating the problem as best they can wherever they can for everyone. So Adam Silver is smart to try and figure that out in the league he has been put in charge of. ",nba

He was clearly still nervous and not confident in his coaching or bench players.

He was doing okay trying to develop the young players, imo - he got them to the level of decent defenders, at least - but he's so incredibly out of his depth trying to get a random set of ill-matched veterans with a star player who was in *the same draft class as him*.

And that's just not true. Denver with KAT may not be the 2 seed but they certainly wouldn't be out of the playoffs. You're underestimating how good and how talented the rest of that roster is. KAT is also certainly not a bad facilitator, and surrounding him with good outside shooters like they have there wouldn't be a struggling team. 

It's not like Jokic is working with a roster of bums like LeBron did in his final Cleveland year. He's working with some very talented young guys like Harris, Murray, Morris, Beasley and experienced and savvy vets like Millsap and Plumlee. His importance to the team is great but it's not so bad that you replace him with KAT and they're suddenly the 12 seed. They'd still be like the 4 or 5 seed, that's how good some of those guys are.

"Disclaimer: I was and am a big Buddy Hield fan coming into this season.
  
I feel like you're being over-optimistic regarding Buddy Hield's creating abilities. Klay has had most of his shots assisted because of the system and team he's on. While it's not clear whether Klay has creating abilities, what *is* clear is that a team with Steph and later also KD, is best off using Klay as an off-ball player.
  
Prior to this season, Buddy Hield was really quite bad at creating, or anything other than shooting 3s, for that matter. His time in NO was an unmitigated disaster, and while he showed a ton of improvement after the Boogie trade that brought him to SAC, last year was a major regression. 

Buddy Hield shot very poorly in 2 point territory aside from around the rim (0-3 ft/RA) in the 2017-18 season. He was absolutely atrocious in the paint, shooting 30% yet taking nearly 100 of them. Truly good players either avoid taking these shots and find a way to get to the rim/ get fouled/pass out (ex. John Wall is bad at these shots but takes far fewer as a percentage), or use their skills to make it a high percentage one (DeMar/LMA shoot far above league average). 
  
Buddy also shot a disproportionate amount of midrange shots but was in the bottom 30% of the league in terms of converting them. This data all indicates significant struggles with shot creation, because by taking a lot of shots he cannot make, it either means he lacks the skill to get to a spot where he can make shots (i.e. around the rim or at the 3 point line), lacks the skill to make shots at the spots he *can* get to, or has poor decision-making. For instance, Steph Curry takes only 26% of his total shot total on 2s outside of the paint, and is incredibly efficient in the mid-range (60%). Buddy Hield took over 35% of shots on these ""bad"" 2s, but also happened to be terrible at making them.
  
All this is supported when I watched him play. He made lots of poor decisions and his handles were awful last year. Again, having a lot of unassisted shots does you and your team no good if you have to miss a lot more just to make them. 
  
This year, a big part of Buddy's improvement has been due to shooting more good shots (2s at the rim) and shooting a higher percentage on them. His midrange has not improved, but he has cut down on them a decent amount, indicating either improved decision-making or better ability to get to the rim. Ironically, more of his 2's are assisted this year, which is probably not a coincidence.

We have Taurean Prince who we can resign for cheap and is already better than some of the guys you’ve pinned as your future. 

We have Deandre bembry and Omari Spellman (our other first round pick from last years stacked draft). Just Incase you’re wondering he shoots 34.5% from three. Only slowed down because he was recently injured. Bembry has Improved steadily in his young career as a guy who can play defense and score. 

Now let’s talk about draft picks. I’m sure You know about that mavs pick which will most likely convey this year but even if it doesn’t will definitely convey next year in a much better draft (fingers crossed). Then we have Cleveland next year top 10 protected. Then after that we have 2021 okc 1stRP. Let’s not forget we don’t owe out our own pick to anyone in the future. 

With Trea young and John Collins and all of Atlanta’s 85 million in cap space to sign 2 potential max contracts and still have room to retool the bench (don’t forget the anti aging man himself VC). Atlanta clearly has the brighter future and it isn’t close. In fact it’s Ludicrous to suggest otherwise.  And when The hawks get their own top 5 pick plus the mavs top 10 pick it will be the cherry on top.

"&gt; And stop with that ridiculous ""G-Leaguers"" argument. CP3 missed what, 25? And Capela 15? 

92 games of g-league players averaging 15 mins a game (often more) actually but nice try anyway.  You should probably lookup the actual stats before talking down about them.

 

&gt;So 50 and 40 games played, and you also signed Faried and Rivers to help in those weeks they missed.

&gt;You make it sound like they missed the entire fucking season and Harden did it all alone. Stop.

You make it sound as if there is no difference between Chris Paul and Clint vs. Rivers and Faried.  Stop.

If Brogdon and Lopez got injured just before the playoffs, you would be crying if you had to rely on Rivers and Faried to fill the gap.  Also this ignores Ennis, Nene, and Gordon all missing major time (two of those are starters btw).

"The best case you could make for Scalia is that he was racially insensitive, and I don't care enough about the semantics of racism to harp on that distinction. He said black people might fare better in ""slower track schools."" He implied that immigration restrictions were lawful in part because states had in the past been allowed to restrict immigration of aliens, including former slaves. I do not consider the treatment of former slaves an adequate measure of moral behavior and if you value strict constitutionalism over morals, you're a piece of shit in my view. I truly do not care about the judicial validity of his rulings.

Also I didn't say he was racist (though he seems to have been) I said he had shitty views. On just about everything. Lgbt rights, abortion, gender discrimination. He was a slave to the constitution and the constitution was written by racist, sexist, homophobic assholes. Sure, they had some good ideas, but they had plenty of bad ones too.

If you wanted a supreme court justice who trump would nominate, you wanted a shitty justice. Because trump has shitty views.

I don't think half the country hates black people. I do think half the country doesn't give enough of a shit about black people to not vote for a racist. Also I don't consider it wrong to hate someone for their political beliefs. Politics is how you believe society should be run and how you feel people in society should be treated. It's a choice, and some of the options are morally wrong. Nazism was wrong, full stop, and I don't feel bad about hating neo-nazis. Trump and (most) trump supporters aren't nazis, but why does that have to be the threshold of hateability? You don't have to be a literal nazi to have shitty views on politics. You don't have to go around lynching black people or calling them the n-word for me to call you a racist and hate you for it.

See how you have to bring up unrelated shit to this game just to try and force your point? Aside from this game, I can't even recall any crucial careless travel he made. Sure than Suns Turnover late in the game was bad, I'm not excusing that. Sure one specific play of miscommunication sums up that he always ball watches, that's the only thing you idiots believe when you don't even watch the games.

5 years ago he was fucking 29 years old. So as his accomplishments rack up, the expectations go up?? So will we expect 40 year old LeBron to regularly put up 45/15/15 every regular season game or else he's coasting?

Fans from across the globe beg the Lakers to trade one of the players but Lebron nixes these when he sees that he can complete the regular season with 0 losses, something MJ was never able to do.

Things go swimmingly until right before the last game of the season Kemba gets incredibly ill eating Blaze pizza. Lebron panics until he realizes the last game is against the Raptors. Lakers win by 50 and complete the first “undefeated” season.

Denver's injury numbers are skewed because they purposefully drafted an injured player they knew they'd sit for most, if not all, of the season. 

And every single team you mentioned would have an increase in wins if they had been fully healthy, which you are denying would have happened for the Lakers.

How does this shit get upvoted? A net neutral player at best? Just watch any Hawks game and you’ll see that he’s by far our most important player and is the biggest reason why we’ve been competitive lately. But since you “don’t care about his offensive stats”, you’re assuming his ability to elevate our offense to another level is completely negated on the other side of the ball. That’s just such a stupid take.

"That’s slightly true. From new borns to adulthood the needed amount of sleep does decrease. But once you’re in adulthood it stays somewhat steady. Studies [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352721815001606?via%3Dihub) recommend 7-9 hours for adults aged 26-64 and 7-8 hours for 65 or older. The lower bound there remains the same. But people who might’ve personally needed 9 hours for most their adult life might only need 8 or so as they get older for example.

The decreased hours in the recommendation by studies is justified by the typical older adults lifestyle that has less (or no) employment-related responsibilities, less strict sleep schedule demands, and increased rates of napping during the day.

Trump, as a 72 year old in a very demanding job, would probably be recommended to get at least 8 hours of sleep per night.

Getting less than 7-8 hours for adults leads to dramatic increases in the chance to get cardiovascular disease, dementia, depression, obesity, and diabetes.

"Something different: Shaq to Miami netted the Lakers Odom and ultimately Pau.

For as great as Shaq was, he was oft-injured and began his decline from All-NBA to All-Star player. 2 great years of Miami Shaq for 2/3^rds of the big men in the Lakers' most recent dynasty.

"I have no explanation as to why Thibs wanted to run an iso system without PNR. I really can't tell you. Towns best asset is his ability to score anywhere on the court with great efficiency. To get him his best looks, we should have a scheme and a player that is very effective in the PNR. Or, alternatively, a player that can at least make effective entry passes. Wiggins would be a great fit if he had better handles. A wiggy towns PNR action would be effective if wiggy could develope. Outside of that, you need defensive players that can space the floor and don't hog the ball. Roco and saric were a phenomenal addition and were the second step the wolves took to build around towns this year (first being drafting okogie and KBD). Roco, in my opinion, is one of the best players you could pair with towns. A defensive monster that can cover a lot of positions, facilitate, and score inside and out. 









I think the development of your roster should be more credited to the coaching staff rather than jokic. Jokic is reaping the benefits of staying with a squad and growing with them and now that they're developed they're killing it. The wolves aren't developed, their injured, their cap is busted, and thibs built a team that doesn't really fit together. I don't think jokic would make this team any better than towns.

How about reducing the tax bill by a higher percentage as you go from winners and losers. So NBA finals team would still pay 100% but the loser would only pay like 95% and down till the 16th team.

"sorry but stats can be empty and Lebron's certainly were.

1-8. Lebron only could figure out how to win 1 game in the last 2 Finals.

Assists are mainly a product of system. Of course Lebron will put up more assists since the ball is in his hands 90% of the time. And of course Lebron will grab more rebounds, because he does not contest shots and does not close out on shooters. All he does is stay in the paint and wait for uncontested rebounds.

Where was the Lebron when it REALLY MATTER?

2017 - Game3. Cavs up by 6 with 2 minutes left. It was KD who closed it out. Outscored Lebron 7-0 in the last 2 minutes. 

2018 - Game3. Cavs up by 1 with 2 minutes left. It was KD who closed it out. Where was Lebron?

Congrats. Lebron scores a ton of points after his team is down by 20+ points. But when the team REALLY NEEDS HIM (both Game 3's) he disappears and its KD who comes up big.",nba
"Unfortunately, once again, your argument is just nonsense.

Your first paragraph simply misses the point; it adds nothing to the discussion and contains no interesting or relevant information.

Your second paragraph seems to badly misunderstand my argument, and also contains some straight-up lies about reality. Do you know where cops go to patrol? They patrol *their jurisdiction*; there are very few areas in the United States where extreme prosperity and extreme poverty exist in close proximity, so most cops are patrolling an area that is, for the most part, economically and racially homogeneous, and those cops still exhibit significant racial bias. If you had looked into the stats like I asked, you would have been aware of this fact.

And even if your argument weren't factually false, you don't seem to have followed it to its conclusion. In *some* areas, your argument is correct; cops in Chicago, for example, spend a disproportionate amount of time close to the south side. Of course, when black teens dare to leave the south side, they often face intense scrutiny, because apparently the presumption of innocence doesn't apply to them, which is another example of blatant racism, but we can ignore that fact. Even if your argument were consistent with reality, would it be just that poor black teens face far more intense scrutiny, and a hugely increased risk of violent altercation, simply because they're born poor? Can you not see how this still constitutes discrimination?

And in your third paragraph, you seem to have missed my point once again. As a side note, you support cops busting drug dealers, as do I, but if ""there will always be another one to fill the position,"" then what's the point of busting them? Your logic here is inconsistent.

Again, we'll ignore the fact that your argument isn't based in reality for a moment. You've strawmanned me in a pretty obvious way; first of all, I'm not the guy who used the phrase ""class traitors,"" but you can be forgiven for that mistake. The fact remains that we should not and cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. The evidence is conclusive, and the result is inevitable: policing practices are unbelievably racist and classist, from the top right down to the bottom. Every single person who participates in the law enforcement apparatus is complicit in this system, and almost all of them know it. I'm not saying that they should, at least, speak out when their superiors ask them to violate the Constitution. When a cop shoots a black child for holding a Nerf gun in a store, I'm not glad that he can ""relate to poor people"" and ""have some empathy,"" and I also don't think that it's *entirely* his fault; in this particular case, the cop's racism was obvious and striking, but, as you point out, it's naive to think that we can eliminate all racism in the police force. On the other hand, we could have a conversation about how we give a whole lot of power to people with demonstrable racial biases and then go ask them to arrest just the bad guys, please; that's inevitably going to spread racism, anybody could see that coming. When a black man is pulled over and shot because an officer thinks that he's reaching for a weapon, despite the fact that the man is not moving, we can blame the cop for his racism, which lead him to believe that any armed black man was a threat regardless of his other behaviors, but we can also have a conversation about the system that put them in this situation. We decided to give a small, largely-unscreened subset of the population the right to use force against anybody who seems like a threat, with very little oversight; is it not obvious how this scenario intersects with racial stereotypes to propagate racism? If so, don't cops have a moral responsibility to notice and respond to the racism that their system helps to spread? (We can also talk about how the law enforcement system protects its own; the cop in this instance was acquitted of all charges, even the simple charge of ""dangerous discharge of a firearm;"" apparently, shooting an innocent man because he looks scary isn't dangerous if you're a cop.)

And I'm glad that you included that edit, because it really sums up the problem here. I should point out that the Stanford Prison Experiment is highly, *highly* dubious; it's known that Philip Zombardo, who conducted the experiment, intervened within the first few days, probably because he wasn't getting the results he wanted. Even if the SPE were better-established, the way you're using it is specious, but this misunderstanding of reality is a consistent thread in your arguments, so it's not worth going into too much depth to illuminate just one more example.

Even then, though, your ""argument"" is just defeatism dressed up like reason. Believe me, I oppose politicians who try to ""crack down on crime"" when crime is at an all-time low; that's part of the problem. I oppose police departments that refuse to prosecute officers who kill black teens; that's part of the problem. But I also take issue with the fact that, despite being held up as moral paragons, people for our children to emulate, cops almost universally fail to address the issues in the system they create. I don't expect that every cop should immediately stop following the directions they're given, but when they cooperate without even saying a word, without even raising the possibility that something might be wrong, that's an issue. It's baffling to me that you can't understand this simple fact.",nba
"Um, three points aren't finesse anything.

"I can appreciate the sentiment, but like I pointed out below, there's no good outcome for the Wolves as long as they are stuck with Wiggins.  There's also zero chance KAT stays after this contract.

So the options are pretty much:

- Ride it out until Wiggins is done.  That will entail a bunch of low lottery picks and maybe a 1st round playoff exit or two if things break their way.  At this point KAT is gone after his contract is up, and the Wolves are entering a full rebuild with a bare cupboard.

- Move KAT ASAP.  They'd get potentially the greatest trade return in history given that he is locked up for the next 5 years.  This allows a full tank and rebuild to come out the other end in great shape when Wiggins is expiring.",nba

"It’s not like they are trying to not get shooters, they just are working with what they have. They surely expected Roberson to develop more as a shooter when he was drafted, and guys like Abrines and Ferguson were drafted as shooters. Patterson was brought in to help space the floor, and Melo obviously was supposed to be an added 3 point threat. Even with a lot of that not materializing, they’ve kept their identity as a great defensive team and playoff contender, if not quite a title contender.

I don’t think it’s true that they’ve never had a shooter either; they had a starting line up including Durant and Ibaka for a long time, with starters/important bench guys like Thabo Sefolosha, Anthony Morrow, even Oladipo and McDermott too. Not to mention that Jerami Grant has become a solid 3 point threat and guys like Jackson and Waiters who could be streaky but were overall solid from 3.

I’d say they’ve pivoted pretty amazingly for a small market team that saw the 2nd best player in the league leave just a few years ago, and would seem to be contenders for the near future with Russ, PG, and Adams locked up along with some solid role players. They’ve had as much playoff success as anyone outside of Golden State, Cleveland, and Houston in the last several years. What more do you really want from a GM?",nba

"You're taking my off the cuff suggestions for replacements way too seriously. The concept is you trade those 3 players and replace them with free agents who will be cheaper or more valuable, and on the team for multiple years instead of one year. Draymond is shooting over 11 percentage points lower from 3 than in 2016. None of this even matters if KD stays, which is 50/50 at this point.

They could trade a combination of Draymond, Iguodala and Livingston with a 2022 pick for some picks in 2020 and 2021.

That leaves them with $49M on payroll for Curry, Jones, McKinnie and Evans. 

$60M left to spend before the cap, which they can use 99% of on players other than Thompson.

Julius Randle for $24M

Bojan Bogdanovic for $18M

Ed Davis for $5M

Dwight Howard for $4M

Carter for $3M

Cook for $2M

Bell for $2M

Draft Pick $600K

You can swap out any number of players here, there are a ton to choose from. I'm not a GM, so I'm not going to spend hours trying to find the most efficient combination of players.

Thompson gets his max for whatever the amount, starts at something like $32M.

Curry, Thompson, Randle and Bojan is damn good. Better than Curry, Thompson and Green + some dude imo. The 2020 free agent class is weak, who will replace Draymond then? I wouldn't sign him to a max.

"I'll copy and paste this from a different comment explaining my side of things. 

JJJ and Ayton rank quite comparatively in regard to their aggregate stats such as RPM, and in my personal view I think JJJ has shown more value as a good defender than Ayton has so far. Ayton has technically been efficient, but given that hes been playing in the post most of the season I dont put as much value in that as others have. JJJ has shown that he can take 3's, while Ayton hasn't done anything at the 3 point line all year.

I'd go more in depth but I'm a bit pre-occupied with some real-life stuff right now, but long story short is that I'm not as sold on Ayton's offensive abilities as others are, and I believe that JJJ is the superior defender. Ayton would have been a no-doubt all star center like 10 years ago, but I think JJJ fits the current NBA better. All of these things are up for debate.

Ben, Zahire, Kawhi, Tobias, Embiid with Tre Jones (who cant shoot the 3 in college but his FT indicates he will be able to, and he does), shake, Thybulle (roco.20), bolden for literally forever, then Mike scott and ennis for a while. weve still got another 2 roster spots for other ppl. 

then we get the celtics in the first round when they are an 8 seed and we beat them in 8. come on, thats how you pie in the sky. haward for durant? and you arent getting AD without giving up tatum. but yall have the ability of the #2 pick, so you can offer either cam reddish or tatum.

"Warriors have 2 main ball handlers being Curry and KD, these are also both MVPs who are great off ball, then you have Klay who doesnt even need to dribble the ball to drop 30+, followed up by great roleplayers and defensive players such as Draymond, Iggy, Livingston etc. We don't have 2 MVPs  on our team.

"I just like feeling validated with my opinion that a Russ led (as in Russ being the best, not the leader) team will never be a contender because of how he plays. Great player, but it isn't gonna get you close to winning a ring imo. For them to succeed, PG needs to play like he was before. I feel the same way about Lillard. It's just really hard for any PG not named Steph to be the #1 guy and win a ring. When's the last time a team won (besides steph, who honestly only won as the clear cut best when the other team had 2 of their 3 best players out and didn't even play that well) where the PG was the best player? Isiah Thomas Pistons? It's not even a slight on the players, for some reason PG spot is just super hard for that. Probably because they're the easiest to shut down with double teams due to their height and usually aren't the best defenders.

Of course the cycle is going to continue. There’s no winning for any side. We need to tackle the harder issues, like poverty and systemic racism on the one end.

Granted, it was just one game and Harden's had similar games that Steph had tonight but given how much KD, Steph, and Klay can alleviate the offfensive burden off of each other throughout the season is just unfair compared to Harden's workload. For the most part, James can carry an offense by himself both as a scorer and facilitator (underrated aspect of his game) at a high level as we've seen for years. As seen tonight, Steph was foul hunting in that Magic game just as Harden is accused of doing which goes to show generating points by any means necessary is crucial if you're going to carry that burden. Steph just simply isn't durable enough to take that many shots and create offensively as James has to do every night.

Spacing is just providing... well, space. You can do that by cutting or just having a big presence of the paint. Coach K talked about this in Redick's or Lowe's podcast.

"&gt;Danny Green would be a top 10 player by those stats.

Come on now, this is an extremely lazy counter-argument. 

First off, no he wouldn't. RAPM loves him (and by that I mean 23rd) but BPM, WS/48, and VORP all think he's average. You didn't even look. I'm not pointing to one advanced stat, I'm pointing to every major advanced stat and they all tell a similar story.

Second off, Embiid and Jokic are both #1 in usage on their team. I'm not comparing a #1 option and a role player 


&gt;The nuggets are one of the deepest teams in the league. Meanwhile, the sixers have had no bench and have completely changed their team 3 times since last year. 

You Sixers fans realize there's a tradeoff here, right? The Sixers' 2-5 is WAY more talented and productive than the Nuggets' 2-5. The Nuggets have more depth but it was decimated for a huge portion of the season, and Jokic doesn't have anything resembling an All-NBA or All-Star level player to fall back on. Both teams faced adversity throughout the season (if we're calling trading role players for stars adversity), but you're entirely focused on the adversity of your own team while ignoring others'.

&gt;On the other hand, jokic is a sub par defender. Golbert got ran off the court last year in the playoffs. Idk what you guys think is going to happen to Jokic when he gets switched onto the likes of Curry, Lilard, Westbrook, Harden, ect every play.

We're talking about All-NBA and that's a regular season award. I even said I think Embiid is a better player, and naturally it would follow I would rather have Embiid in the playoffs. You obviously aren't keeping up with the conversation.

&gt;The last thing I will say is we now fetishized advance stats way to much, and have forgotten they are not the be all end all. They are good for figuring out which role players are better, but when we use them to argue 20/11/8 is better than 28/14/4, we are missing the point.

Using nothing but points per game, rebounds per game, and assists per game to judge who the more impactful player is will lead you to some incredibly stupid conclusions. It's bewildering that I even need to say this. The best analysis is done by using counting stats, advanced stats, and the eye test in conjunction. Not just cherry-picking stats and narratives so you can pump up your guy like you're so blatantly doing.

Jokic is one of the best passers in the league, perhaps the best big man passer ever, and you can build an elite offense with him and some 13-15 PPG role players that aren't sniffing an All-Star game otherwise. It's an entire dimension to his game that Embiid doesn't have. 

But for some reason I have a feeling that playmaking all of the sudden becomes paramount to you when the discussion is Simmons vs. Someone Else.",nba
I'll give you an E for effort on this one. But Okogie was the first guy to completely smother Harden's stepback by pure footwork. The NBA metagame gets constantly updated by players naturally working out stuff. Okogie just contributed to it with a specific tactic vs a specific shot. ,nba
"I just can't imagine the Clippers would want to max Kyrie after everything that's happened this year, both with their own team and with the Celtics.

Kyrie to the Lakers or Knicks seems perfect for all parties involved, because it's about brand and making a splash rather than actual winning championships and on-court fit.

The Clippers have an identity as a hard-nosed, defensive team that gives great effort at all times and get along.  Does that sound like a Kyrie Irving-led squad?  ",nba
No people give LeBron less flak now because it turns out those Heat weren't unbeatable in hindsight like the world thought they would be when he first signed. It was still competitive.

Drafted in 95 by Detroit with the 19th overall pick, though played his first two season for Portland before going to Detroit in 1997. He would go play in Turkey in 1997 before the NBA season ended. That was the end of his NBA career. He played on 12 different teams over seas from 1997 to 2011. Since 2013 he has been on the coaching staff at his alma mater, Wake Forest. I couldn’t find any other highlights besides the cross over so here is an entire game from his 1994 college season, Wake Forest (a team that featured future NBA players Randolph Childress, Tim Duncan, and Rusty LaRue) vs Florida State (a team that featured future NBA players Bob Sura, James Collins, Charlie Ward, and Johnathan Kerner)

"They're a piece of tech, honestly.  I've looked into them a lot and I was really into getting one once I could afford it, but as I've gotten a little older I've seen the downsides.  Just my personal opinions:  

* **Maintenance** You have the typical features of an electric car in that most of the maintenance you'd be used to on a normal car are nonexistent, like changing your oil.  Because they use motors, they don't have as many pieces that can go wrong, either, like timing belts or radiators.  Motors can go wrong and you might get a faulty battery (same as regular cars), but because the battery is so integral to the vehicle it's a much bigger deal when it fails.  I think they would have to take apart the car completely to replace a dead battery.  I'm not saying it's a common occurrence but it's a possibility.

* **Interior (and features)** The Tesla has a lot of bells and whistles to distract you from other things.  The Model 3 only has a single display (meaning there isn't a speedometer behind the steering wheel), but it's huge and touchscreen and controls basically everything, same as the S and X.  The car uses Google maps as its guidance system, allows you to use the back-up camera at all times, and has other nifty things that are convenient; the X, for example, automatically opens the driver's side door whenever it senses you approaching.  It also has Summon, which allows the car to back up or move forward without you being in the car.  However, the actual interior is pretty lackluster.  The materials they use are cheaper, and don't have as nice of a feel that you would experience in a Lexus/BMW/Mercedes.  I don't think they even offer real leather as an option anymore, in favor of their artificial version that's cheaper.  The backseats in the S and X are not comfortable, and the X's 3^rd row is easy to get in and out of, but hard to sit in.  It's a cool car, not a luxury car.

* **Drive** It's a very different experience driving a Tesla.  They don't have any gears (outside of drive, reverse, and park) because it's a motor, not an engine, so you just keep accelerating.  There's no ignition, so the car just sorta turns on when you ""shift"" into drive.  They also have ""regenerative braking"", which is hard to explain but is basically the car using its own momentum to gleam a small charge back into the battery.  The result is that you don't idle nearly as far as you would in a normal car - the car will slow down abruptly whenever you take your foot off the gas at speeds below like 30 mph, which is hard to get used to for a short while.  However, the acceleration is *incredible*; I've done 4-5 test drives between the X and the S, and they both just launch.  It's a very fun experience and I don't think people ever get tired of it.

Longer than I intended originally but again, just my thoughts.",nba
This isn't 2k so trades like this don't and shouldnt happen but Simmons Luka straight up might benefit both teams.  Redick and Luka aren't a fit but Redick can be moved on quickly for a better defender.

I love how much he wants to be a Blazer, I love how much of a dog he is, and it’s so apparent how much losing Nurk hurts him.

The team had a bunch of players who thrived in the paint, but no one to space the floor. It's almost like it was a team built around having an elite floor spacing scorer... 

When Sabonis is your second best 3 pt shooter, it makes things a whole lot more difficult for guys like Kanter and Adams to thrive, as the paint would be packed. It took away Robersons effectiveness in cutting to the rim too. OKC were the worst 3 pt shooting team that year, but Russ singlehandedly willed that team to wins that they had no business winning, with one of the most clutch seasons ever. If you think he only won MVP because of a few uncontested rebounds, then you clearly weren't watching their games, or fell for baseless narratives.

AD said he just wants to win. Don't let Rich Paul fool you. AD to LA was all Rich Paul led to get him to play with his buddy Lebron.

"I've lived 20 minutes from Boston my whole life and I've never heard or seen a single act of racism ever in public. The first thing you need to know about Boston is that hardly anyone lives there anymore. It's all college kids, and expensive ass condo's and apartments and it has been completely gentrified. Even the infamous ""southie"" is all comprised of young working professionals from all over the globe. The same goes for most of the surrounding burbs as well. I'd say there are just as many people from around the world in the immediate area than there are Irish or Italian anymore.

Anyway, I can't comment on it's past. I'm in my 30's. I can tell you that new england is mostly white outside the city areas. But I'd wager that's the same for most northern climates. Sure, I bet blue collar white dudes can be racist, but probably not more so than any other race in similar situations.

What I can tell you is that Boston is one of the safest cities for a person of any color to walk around in at any time of day or night. So maybe there is some racism but it's closeted racism and non violent. This is not the same city as what people think of from 40 years ago.",nba

"None of this is remotely true. The Giants made the right decision by trading Odell. He hasn't been healthy in two years, and they got a bubble pro bowl safety that arguably has more potential than Landon Collins. We all know what Odell can do when healthy. He's a friggin beast. Unfortunately, he didn't add any Ws in the past two years (not all his fault), and the Giants would have to sign Odell to a massive contract. 

The Giants save money, got a long term safety, and acquired picks for a window that Odell wasn't a part of.

The Browns are in the right direction, but nothing is guaranteed in the NFL. We have no idea if they're gonna be able to repeat what they put together when Baker stepped in forn Tyrod. There's a whole lotta film and an off-season for coaches to game plan against

The Knicks are the epitome of dog shit, but at least they have a solid plan for the first time ever in my 28 years of fandom. The Browns constantly floundered top 3 picks, while the Knicks squandered mid 1st round picks year in and year out. With a little luck in the draft lottery, and the right free agent signings, the Knicks could be a top team in the east. Obviously nothing is guaranteed",nba

No he doesnt, until you show stats on this, It doesnt mean much.

&gt;You mean hard stats?

It's not a hard stat, there are many factors that go into post ups, same with judging defense, you are almost certainly one of those people who use DRTG and DRPM to judge the best defenders in the league..

&gt;No, it’s like if some defender has the best FG% and eFG% in the entire league on defense, while also matching up more often than anyone in the league.

Already answered this above.

&gt;It’s simple maths really. If someone has the most post-ups in the league, while also holding opponents to the lowest efficiency in the entire league, that’s literal proof.

yikes, this is why defense is judged through eye test and not stats, because nephews like you think defense can be quantified through stats this doesnt account for who is posting up, passing out of post ups, help defense, it doesnt account for anything.

You really gonna take Harden over AD in a 1v1 post up vs Embiid? LMAO

"Speaks the truth tbh. Sitting games out is part of the more analytically driven trend the NBA is going through right now, where the regular season is just a skipping stone for the better teams and resting your stars ""makes sense"" to have them in pristine condition for the postseason, the games that ""really matter"".      
          
Yet we brush off the fact that, for these players, basketball is not only their living but also something they *enjoy* doing. It was the same when people were all saying Zion should sit out; why play those meaningless games before being drafted? A lot of times we look at the game through the analytical glass and forget its humane nature. Playing ball is fun, and I'm sure Kobe has some beautiful memories from reg season games that players who sit out end up missing out on.

"It's really about wingspan and standing reach in addition to his height. 

Wingspan helps you recover from defensive mistakes or lack of speed in addition to making finishing around the basket easier. Standing reach helps you to challenge shots. 

Trae has a small wingspan and standing reach, meaning he's undersized not only in height but in those categories as well.

It's possible to be a decent defender despite being as undersized as him but he'd need to be exceptional at playing the right angles and have great lateral quicks. Steph Curry for instance is only slightly less undersized in all those ways and has managed to be a decent defender.",nba

"I love Chuck most of the time but I think he needs to chill on this. Imo he's wading into disgruntled old man yells at cloud territory here - just because you make a lot of money doesn't mean you're not ever allowed to be unhappy or complain about things occasionally. Also he doesn't know a lot of these guys personally and is just making assumptions about how they feel. I doubt Kyrie actually ""can't wait to get away from this shit."" Idk if he even really said that or it's paraphrasing, but it sounds like a hyperbolic statement about not enjoying the 24/7 Twitter/ soundbite fueled media cycle of today's NBA. 

Didn't Steve Kerr talk about how today's NBA players are part of this weird soap opera now and it's no longer about just basketball anymore? Didn't a lot of us on r/NBA eat that up and mostly agree with him? Obviously I'm a Celtics fan, but imo there's a lot of very valid things to criticize Kyrie/today's NBA on, but I think saying ""you make a lot of money, you can't say anything critical and have to always smile"" is kind of unfair and out of touch. Today's players have to deal with a lot more scrutiny and neverending media coverage than they did in Barkley's day, and it doesn't seem like he's considering that.

Also none of us here on r/NBA know what kinda mental toll that takes either, so it's easy for us and Chuck to say shut up and deal with it, you're making 40mil. But it seems like it really affects some players, and Adam Silver is right to be worried about it because the mental wellbeing of his players should be important to him as commissioner.

My point was that Luke did not scheme around personnel.


For example, their switch everything defense. Last year, Kuzma got abused like 5 posessions in a row by CP3 because they switched everything too easily. They didnt fight screens, there barely was even a screen in that Rockets game. This was even after a timeout in between IIRC. Brook was abused the same way and we’ll probably see it in the playoffs if Bud keeps him on the floor.

"He’s a really rigid athlete. He doesn’t have the fluidity and balance that other elite scorers have (think Kobe or Kyrie) - he has the range of motion of a GI Joe.  The best finishers know how to use their bodies to make the most out of difficult attempts, but Wiggins either has to get past his defender or shoot over him. Case in point: I’m pretty sure I’ve seen Wiggins complete one reverse layup in his entire career as a Timberwolf. One. ",nba
"And feeling so entitled to do so that he had to put his hands on him. You clearly hear him state ""don't touch me, just say sit down"". Anyone who thinks they are going to have complete visibility 100% of the game is a clown, anyone who doesn't realize the majority of the first row behind the bench is coaching staff probably hasn't watched an NBA game before. It's common sense to know your view will be obstructed at times when sitting at a level to those in front of you, it is common courtesy not to put your hands on people.   


Your view of the game is still 1000% better than 99.9% of people will ever be fortunate enough to see, you don't need to interfere with people's jobs and have the dickish and child-like demeanor to tug on people to get what you want because things aren't 100% the way your ego thinks you should have it at all time.

"&gt; 3 rings, 4 MVPs. There are a couple of people with more accomplishments than that in the NBA. Let alone the others sports. We are talking about accomplishments no who do you think plays the best.

Rings and MVPs are not the only way to measure accomplishments and rings are a poor way to measure individual success in basketball.  Wilt has 2 rings yet is one of the most dominant and most accomplishment players of all time.  Rings are a team accomplishment but in something like tennis winning a grand slam is 100% on the individual player.  

Maybe that's the disconnect.  If you're looking at just titles/MVPs you're leaving out dozens of other career accomplishments.  All-NBA appearances, All defensive appearances, scoring titles, and then feats like being the..

* Only player in NBA history to record at least 32,000 points, 8,000 rebounds, and 8,000 assists.
* Only player in NBA history to average at least 27 points, 7 rebounds, and 7 assists for their career.[32]
* Only player in NBA history to post at least 2,000 points, 500 rebounds, 500 assists, and 100 steals in four consecutive seasons.[33]

"To be fair, the warriors were great but still very beatable until they added KD.

Between playing with Steph and all the drama surrounding him, people forget how easily he can put up an efficient 30 night after night.

"So here’s a reworked suggested best possible working cohesive team of all time. If you’ve got a team that could beat them feel free to add your reasoning.

**PG:** 01/02 Jason Kidd - ideal game: 10+ pts, 10+ ast, 5+ rebs

**SG:** 15/16 Stephen Curry - ideal game: 20+ pts, 5+ ast, 3+ 3pt

**SF:** 89/90 Michael Jordan - ideal game: 20+ pts. 5+ast, 5+ rebs

**PF:** 84/85 Larry Bird - ideal game: 15+ pts, 10+ rebs, 5+ ast

**C:** 61/62 Wilt Chamberlain - ideal game: 25+ pts, 15+ rebs, 3+ blk

For **PG** - Jason Kidd, over Magic or Big O because of being assist-first rather than score first (even though Magic was the GOAT passer) and three-pointers, over Nash because of his top tier perimeter defense, and over Stockton because of his rebounding prowess. He can let you build the team around someone else perfectly.

For **SG** - Steph Curry, over Jordan at this position because as a combo guard, he is still there to provide those additional crucial assists and support MJ while still being free to efficiently down his countless threes whenever he is open. Over Jerry West because his true 3pt prowess will never be known, and over Kobe simply because of efficiency. Current Harden is a TBD atm, but could be at least a very worthy contender soon.

For **SF** - Michael Jordan, as an SF, akin to his later career, feels better building the team around the SF but still with the GOAT winger/player with Curry as his support. Top tier defender, goes without saying. GOAT SG/SF over any generational legends.

For **PF** - Larry Bird - can rebound, assist, score, contribute, whatever you want from him. Shouldn’t have any problems taking a lesser scoring role as a supporting PF for spacing. Over any natural PFs who weren’t really as good as Bird and a notch over LeBron because of his overall selflessness to the team even though late LeBron is perhaps as equally good at that.

For **C** - Wilt Chamberlain - but with Kareem in the closest second place of this entire team. Don’t know which would work out better in real life, personally like Kareem way more, but Wilt’s stats in every category are just impossible to overlook. Either way those two can’t be topped at C, not by even Moses (who could be a great PF though) or Russell.

**Bench:** Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, John Stockton, LeBron James, Moses Malone, Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant, Oscar Robertson.

One last thing, the GOAT players at their position though: Magic, MJ, Bron, Duncan, Wilt. There we go, that one was easy to make, but using this lineup above is the most basic bitch thing to do and almost certainly wouldn’t work the best.

Feel free to completely shatter any of my theories if you’ve got points to disagree with.

"Seems like it's just the law of averages. It's not fun to post about a player shooting at their average or teams playing at their expected level. Posts are made about Klay starting the season shooting 20%. Or Marcus Morris shooting 50% from 3 through the first 10 games. Once people start to notice and talk about it, the law of averages kicks in and klay goes drags his average up and Mook drags his back down to earth. OKC and San Antonio just went in reverse directions. OKC was a threat in the west and SAS were hoping to make the playoffs. Now SAS are 9-1 in their last 10 and OKC might be the 8 seed.",nba
"Yea I can see that side of your argument for sure,  I have a problem with people saying that Giannis could output at the rate Harden does if he only increase his volume.  There's no way to know that, we don't know if that would effect his percentage, or if he would get worn down or god forbid, even injured.  There's just too much assumption in that scenario.  Regardless, it's a heated race, and of course I want Harden to win, but both are deserving, and I'd much rather Harden do his thing in the playoffs and get a championship over this personal trophy.",nba
"For sure. The wingspan is ""only"" like 7""-7'1"" and he's probably not thick enough to really protect the rim or guard 5s but I'm optimistic for him if he stays at the 4. He's got a lot of time to improve on that end at like 19 years old and he always plays his ass off which is a big part of D lol. 

Either way, he's gonna be dynamic and fun as hell to watch for a long time. Just wanna see that D improve gradually, and offensively use that right hand a bit more and work on the jumper. I think he's got a future, especially if Sacramento can find a good front court pairing for him. ",nba
"Hey, I'm totally for appreciating what Harden is doing, I think this is for sure one of the top individual performances in NBA history.  

But if we're going here, before KD came Curry averaged 30 ppg on 67% TS, while sitting 4th quarters, winning unanimous MVP, and breaking the reg season win record. 

If you're on a 73 win team, 30 ppg on 67% TS &gt; 37 ppg on 62% TS. If he bumped up his volume to match Harden's I don't doubt he would've gotten the extra PPG but the team would not have been better for it. 2015-16 Curry is still the goat offensive regular season. ",nba
There's always more hype around European players because we're still not 100% used to their system.

"It's kinda hard to say but looking at their career numbers AG shoots it better from 10-16ft , 16ft-3pt line and 3pt line by a significant margin all the while taking way more shots in those areas

"One thing I've noticed is that against guys who do a lot of fakes like Embiid or Harden do worse against some slower defender who just don't react as easily but still have the ability to be physical on defense

You brought up Myles Turner in another comment. He is trying to block everything (because he can). Guys like Embiid are able to use that jumpiness against the defender really well. Gasol is older and slower.  He just doesnt react to joel's quick twitch pump fakes so he's able to stay with embiid on those patented drives from the top of the arc better   

Not to bring it back to my own team but a similar example I've noticed is how different players on our team guard Harden (whose play style is actually a lot more similar to embiid than we realize). Looney is slow, he doesnt bite on any of harden's fakes. Meanwhile Klay is all over the place against Harden. ",nba

Simmons is a basketball savant. He has some otherworldly feel for the game that I don't think I've ever seen in someone so young.

KD's move is the most egregious because he left a team that was clearly a present and future contender to join a team that had already won without him.  ",nba

Zion just put in the time and concern - after hearing from his step father - and simply became aware of all full game video/etc, and saw.  As a player learning the game or even just a fan, just for the strong mental approach to every game - MJ should be required watching - much less for all the other reasons.

""Im sorry for my previous behavior, I would really like the opportunity to be a part of a team, use my limited minutes as much as I can,  to help the team above all else, and if opportunity arises, to go back to my old self, and repossess the confidence I once had in Celtics""

Averages in the last season playoffs Portland vs Pelicans:

- Anthony Davis: 33/12/1 shooting 57% FG
- Damian Lillard: 18/4/5 shooting 35% FG

"Everybody knows the draft odds are 14% for the worst 3 teams. The issue is what happens if, in the worst case scenario, everyone gets jumped. The worst record has a 50% chance of falling to 5. 

So saying ""Oh the 3 worst records all have the same shot at Zion, pffft"" is a useless rebuttal to people upset about useless wins. The question becomes, what happens if you miss out on Zion? The 5th pick is objectively better than the 6th pick which is objectively better than the 7th pick. Not to mention picks 2-4. Those things do matter. Be it just having a better chance to draft the guy you want or having just that much more value for a draft day trade.

Like just a few years ago, the Knicks got a couple useless late season wins and put us at the 2nd best odds in the lottery. That year we were the only team to get jumped and we fell to 4. Luckily we picked up KP with that pick, but the point remains. Even when the odds were good, you could still fall back and potentially miss out. Now the odds are even more stacked and you're even more likely to fall and you can even fall further than before.

The worst record may have the same odds at the first pick as everyone else, but the less people that jump the better your pick will be. It isn't *just* about having the best shot at Zion, its about better the odds of any other contingency.",nba

GS looks tired and annoyed. They have 0 bench. Their best line ups always have at least 1 player you can leave wide open. Boogie is going to be so exposed to the point of being unplayable, and he will pout so hard if benched.

"Reminds me of this legendary Argentinian soccer forward, Gabriel Batistuta, who in an interview a year or 2 ago stated that he asked his doctor (I believe right after he retired) if he can have his legs amputated because he just couldn't bare the pain in his legs anymore.

EDIT

[Here is an article](https://www.dreamteamfc.com/c/news-gossip/253249/argentina-legend-gabriel-batistuta-once-asked-doctors-to-amputate-his-legs/) that talks about Batistuta and that he actually begged doctors to amputate his legs due to the unbearable pain. 

[Here is an interview with Batistuta in Spanish]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0b-iBclCM) where he talks about his struggles (couldn't walk at all 2 days after announcing his retitrement and would piss himself in his bed because he couldn't walk are some things) and where he actually says ""cut my legs off. I can't anymore"" and that he looked at the South African runner Pistorius and thought ""that's my solution"" (in relation to the amputated leg obviously). 

His problem was that he had no cartilage nor tendons in between his bones. So all his weight is supported bone against bone. He has improved a lot from his problems by resting his legs and when standing or walking he'd support himself with one leg and let the other rest and then switch. Last year he explained more things but he's certainly in a better spot. He plays pickup soccer but with much older men so he doesn't have to push himself.",nba

Friendly gold bet on it? I don't think KD will go to the Lakers; his biggest public image issue is that he can't do it by himself.

The last thing that would help his image is going to the Lakers to play second fiddle to Lebron, even if KD outplays Bron there.

If we were playing a series and you were paying Durant per se Tucker would be the guy that's probably best to put on KD IMO and I think your biggest weakness is just a lack of shot creation beyond Steph. I think your teams plan B when teams just double the hell out of Steph off the ball is probably the biggest question mark but most nights the defense will make up for it and even though Draymond has started to age he can still playmake like he used to",nba
He is the best player on the team. Curry gravity is important  but KD is more consistent than Steph  on the playoffs. I feel that even on the games where Curry scores 30 points he plays like shit for like 2 or even 3 quarters  but has sudden bursts where he scores 4 3s in a row. I dont see nothing wrong with picking Steph over KD but his defense and consistency has me choosing KD over Steph. ,nba

You can't get the job you want since you don't have the diploma so you clock in early, give top customer service and keep showing that: even if the manager knows you will be gone in a couple years, that you are next in line for every promotion and tasks.

You are clearly over qualified and the manager and customers are getting a kick out of it but here you are dealing with others incompetence and not really learning anything for some low salary and showing eveyone how you represent the company just so when the real employers call, your manager can say you are something special.

Since the trade, the Mavs have had probably the worst lineup in the league. Our best players beyond Luka are Jalen Brunson and Dwight Powell.

I think ultimately it’s a non factor as both teams are so clearly bad, but it seems Trae has had a more favorable roster situation around him all year, particularly because he’s gonna get 60+ games out of Collins and he didn’t have the whole team shipped off half way through it.",nba

Yes, Livingston-Thompson-Iguodala-Green-Cousins is a good team on paper, probably a team many would consider playoff caliber. Games aren't won on paper, though. At the beginning of the season, Pelicans and Lakers were projected to finish above many teams currently in playoff positions.

Also I know you were just going PG, but don't you notice any trends in the names you chose? You picked guys who got by with polished skills and non-athletic gifts...the athletic freaks get drafted young, the ones who aren't sought after as much stay longer in school.

Fact of the matter is a lot of high profile young guys (18-20) actually are able to adjust pretty quickly, some take 3-4 years to hit their stride but we see such a high % of them really start to hit the ground running.

"Even though the franchise has been underwhelming for a period, we haven't been no laughing matter in any way, shape, or form; for a quite a long time. Can't say that about the 76ers. It all begins with the understanding that sports culture (basketball in particular) in Michigan isn't something to be taken light of.  We produce a great portion of high quality ball players, consistently. Those in the front office (other then the junk Ford family) for Detroit teams, have a relationship to the city and what we expect from our teams. Pistons have brought in great talent, during the recent struggles they've endured,  but we just haven't found the chemistry that the bad boys and the 01-08 teams had. Hell, the move to downtown Detroit is a reflection of good communication with the city and its citizens.

Since the 2001-2002 season, the 76ers have finished with less than 20 wins three times. Our beloved Pistons...Zero. 76ers finished in 13th place or worse five separate times. Pistons... Zero. Those seasons, tell me that the front office does not give a damn about the quality they bring to their fans. 

Blame it on bad luck with draft picks or whatever you'd like. I see other variables for a lack of success in some cities or franchises.

They are so heads and shoulders stacked with more talent than the other team that it doesn't matter how good the other teams players are and it doesn't really reflect on their greatness that they beat other teams. If you put 4 or 5 players of the caliber of GSW players aka two mvps, a dpoy, and an all star on ANY TEAM in the league they would win the chip. It wouldn't be a reflection of those individual players, rather it would be a reflection of the front office's talent. Seriously, take any two MVPs, a DPOY, and multi-time allstar, any combination and that team will win a chip almost any single year except maybe 96 when the Bulls when 70-12 and essentially had a superteam of their own with two MVP level players and DPOY plus depth. 

Again this isn't shitting on the players, they're obviously very good, but the idea that their wins are immortalized or lauded or something to talk about it laughable imo. A lot of teams don't have a single all star, they have 5 guys who in recent years have made it, plus another on the bench. Why would anyone ever be impressed when they win? They're not playing on anything close to an even playing field compared to the rest of the teams. They 4-0'd a ""super team"" with Lebron and two all stars then added another all star to their one weakness(center). It's just not impressive when they win because they're so much more talented.

But to further end this stupidity. 2015 contract was an EXTENSION, and TT was considering signing the 1 year 6.8 mill to stay one more year with the Cavs. But Lebron clearly pushed the FO to give them a bloated contract. 

6.8 mil was the far better deal for TT. You literally have no clue what you are talking about. 

This is EXACTLY what the Mavs did: gave Noel a relatively large contract: Noel wanted more: Noel signs the qualifying offer because MAVS’ BEST PLAYER DID NOT FORCE THEM TO GIVE HIM A HUGE CONTRACT. 



You never overpay for an undersized big with zero offensive game.. especially when he’s not great defensively.

"You said he’d easily be a 90s Star and maybe better, so wasn’t sure what you meant. I agree he’d be a star in any era and probably and MVP candidate in any era. However I think his iso greatness is at least partially predicated on his foul game setup. If he’s not allowed to create the fear of fouls in his opponent is he really better than say a Dr J or Isiah Thomas? If not, then that’s no insult. It’s hard to say. I personally see him as less skilled because I think the foul game setup is a gimmick below a true star but that’s probably my old head opinion. Everyone does it now so I guess you can’t be penalized for being really good at it. It’s just sad to me and I want to disincentive it by hoping anyone who exploits it is discredited.",nba

Jordan won MVP, Defensive Player of the Year, Scoring Title, lead the league in steals, 1st Team All NBA, and 1st team All Defense.  Only thing Jordan didn't do was win the championship.

Harden will win the Scoring Title, obviously.  He may lead the league in steals, he's currently 2nd.  Will be 1st Team All NBA.  Don't know if he'll be on the All Defense Team, probably doubtful.  Plus, worst of all, Giannis is the current favorite to win MVP (I think it should go to Harden, but we'll see).

Some laker fans might blame him for ruining their team but some will also recognize an incredible player playing for their team. Outside la lebron was never going to be remembered for his time in LA. We're all gonna remember him as a cavalier cause Cleveland is where his legacy will always lie. He's prob gonna spend the last year or two of his career there too",nba
Boogie is a liability on defense that is horrible defending the pick and roll. Harden and CP3 are pick n roll maestros. Their coach is also in love woth that play.

He is having an incredible season offensively, but we know that the best way for superstars to drag bad teams into the playoffs is to take on more of the load scoring wise. Being able to put up an efficient 27 every night is unbelievable, but now that he doesn't have All-NBA teammates to defer to he needs to forget about his efficiency and start scoring more.

27 is points is just 27 points no matter how efficient it is and when you combine that with a lack of effort defensively, it's not surprise that he didn't drag the Lakers into the playoffs single-handedly.

They're gonna get a major free agent this Summer one way or another, maybe two. Lebron is gonna be fuming at home during the playoffs. Next year he's going to come out on an absolute mission.

"Giannis is brining the ball up the floor, 20 seconds left. Buds signaled for a clear out, only KD stands at the top of the arc, beckoning Giannis to drive on him.

He hesitates a split second as KD adjusts, then blows by him to the left block. 2 seconds, 1 second, Giannis kisses a floater off the glass, the clock is under a second as the entire Fiserv Forum gasps and holds it’s breath. The second lasts an eternity, the hopes and dreams and lives of millions of Milwaukians tied to the ball as so many delicate strands of hair in the wind. The buzzer sounds, breaking the spell. The ball bounces off the front of the rim, back of the rim, bouncing once more off each side. It spins around and around and drops. It swings through the net with a resounding “swoosh.” Giannis reacts first, thrusting his entire body skyward roaring a victory cry. He opens his eyes to the heavens and peers to the scoreboard. 117-98, Warriors. Game 4 - Warriors win the series
4-0. Evil rules for a thousand years as the rivers turn red with blood and snow falls like ash across the NBA. “Nothing can stop us now.” KD whispers from under his hood. Off in the distance, peering through the metal pipes and framework of the rafters, a young boy witnesses the murder. Soon he will be strong enough to challenge the ever kings. Soon he will bring justice to the kingdom. He slinks off back to his home eager to continue his training. His custom Nikes blow out on his way down and he sprains his knee.

It could be kinda nice if record got less important, but as the same time it would be bad since it would question previous winners.

"I think first the thing to do is to get rid of the six extra games packed into the schedule. That would bring down the average number of games per week to around three. I'd like to see it a bit lower than that. Say 2 games one week and three the next. So like 60 games would be ideal if they could figure out a way to balance the schedule somehow. 

But as you say there are the finances to consider so I'm not sure they can cut a full 22 games out of the schedule. Personally I think the league should also consider packing nonconference games into sections of the schedule where teams play five or even six games in those weeks. A 76 game schedule (minus the extra six games) with 3 ""schedule smash"" weeks (one for each division of the opposing conference) of 16 total games would leave the rest of the schedule with around 2 and a half games per week. The schedule smashes would be extremely hectic but the rest of the schedule would proceed at a pace that allows for solid planning and effort for each game. 

I think the difference between those games and the regular season games we have now would be very noticeable. When the Lakers played in Detroit last week I did happen to notice that LeBron didn't suit up. I also noticed when Blake Superior didn't play Monday against the Nets and those Pistons who did came out pretty flat after playing their third game in four days.

Yeah you don't know what that error is either, it has nothing to do with this. There is no error, and let me explain:

Assume the sequence is 111011101111. If I were to ask how many streaks of three are there, there'd be 4 precisely.

Contrast this with the part in the paper you're mistakenly reading:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Suppose a researcher looks at the data from a sequence of 100 coin flips, collects all the flips for which the previous three flips are heads and inspects one of these flips. To visualize this, imagine the researcher taking these collected flips, putting them in a bucket and choosing one at random. The chance the chosen flip is a heads—equal to the percentage of heads in the bucket—we claim is less than 50 percent.

&gt;&gt;&gt; To see this, let’s say the researcher happens to choose flip 42 from the bucket. Now it’s true that if the researcher were to inspect flip 42 before examining the sequence, then the chance of it being heads would be exactly 50/50, as we intuitively expect. But the researcher looked at the sequence first, and collected flip 42 because it was one of the flips for which the previous three flips were heads. Why does this make it more likely that flip 42 would be tails rather than a heads?

&gt;&gt;&gt; If flip 42 were heads, then flips 39, 40, 41 and 42 would be HHHH. This would mean that flip 43 would also follow three heads, and the researcher could have chosen flip 43 rather than flip 42 (but didn’t). If flip 42 were tails, then flips 39 through 42 would be HHHT, and the researcher would be restricted from choosing flip 43 (or 44, or 45). This implies that in the world in which flip 42 is tails (HHHT) flip 42 is more likely to be chosen as there are (on average) fewer eligible flips in the sequence from which to choose than in the world in which flip 42 is heads (HHHH).

&gt;&gt;&gt; This reasoning holds for any flip the researcher might choose from the bucket (unless it happens to be the final flip of the sequence). The world HHHT, in which the researcher has fewer eligible flips besides the chosen flip, restricts his choice more than world HHHH, and makes him more likely to choose the flip that he chose. This makes world HHHT more likely, and consequentially makes tails more likely than heads on the chosen flip.

&gt;&gt; In other words, selecting which part of the data to analyze based on information regarding where streaks are located within the data, restricts your choice, and changes the odds.

which is about how choosing where streaks are located changes the odds of getting a Head. In my example, THERE IS NO ODDS, just a simple accounting of PRECISELY how many streaks of three there are.

"The team was forgettable with the two healthy, and Cousins' injury was so serious that it was wise to be wary. The team was 27-21 with Cousins healthy. They were 21-13 after he got hurt. If Cousins came back, that would have pushed Mirotic to the bench, and odds are you don't get the same Cousins.

Furthermore, the Pels were in a shit situation precisely because early in AD's career they went all teenage horny to add talent ASAP, trading multiple picks to add brand name players like Jrue Holiday, Ryan Anderson, Tyreke Evans and Omer Asik. They spent big on second rate players because either they were desperate to please Davis or they were just dumb or impatient. 

That put them in a situation where they sucked and had few ways of getting better and forced them into making that desperation Cousins trade. Had they just used Davis's first couple seasons to stay young and cap-flexible, they would have added at least one more high lotto pick. Maybe when Davis hits 22 or so, it starts making sense to trade picks/youth, and by that time, you have enough resources to move for someone far better than Jrue Holiday, and maybe Davis's talent opens up the possibility of signing a more meaningful free agent.",nba

"He control the ball a lot, but he’s teammate still put up quantity amount of shots. When harden draws double team, he’s able to find open man. That’s why he’s assist is pretty good too.

"It's an oversimplification to make a point, but it's true enough. 

We can see it looking at the basic ways machine learning approaches often work. Take a neural network. Every ""neuron"" is just a linear combination of inputs plus some activation function that maps it's varied inputs to a desired output. It optimizes it's weights to correspond with supplied training values. i.e. each neuron is doing linear regression with an activation function. 

On the flip side, looking at what we are trying to accomplish we can also see how it is like fancy regression. Many of the real world applications of machine learning are regression problems. Take a series of x values and find the best straight line fit to the y values is regression, but that's just the simplest case. Imagine training an SVM to learn from NBA data and predict the spread of a game. That's taking old NBA data and finding the best function to fit the spread. It's regression. Take a picture and identifying the pixels that represent a cat. That's taking fitting a function between a matrix of numbers to another matrix of numbers. Regression. The function is no longer linear, and the inputs are no longer numbers, but it's still regression. ",nba
" First thing I’d do is to trade Ingram for Kawhi. There you already have 2 superstars in LeBron and Kawhi.

  Next thing is to fill out the rest of the roster with shooters and good defenders. I would still sign Lance, Rondo and maybe Javale, but absolutely no Beasley. Afterwards I would re-sign Brook Lopez

In the end you end up with this starting five;

Lonzo
Kawhi
LeBron
Kuzma
Lopez

I believe this is a definitive playoff team in the West and rivals the Rockets as the Warriors biggest challenger

"Kobe could check speedsters better than Tmac IIRC. I remember when Kobe shut down the likes of Mighty Mouse for example. He was definitely better at chasing guys like RIP/Reggie around. 

Tmac could check 7 footers like KG/Dirk tho. One of Tmac's finest moments was dragging his injured squad to 7 games against the superior Mavs whilst helping limit Dirk to a miserable series. He got alot of defensive praise from some coaches after that series (which was basically the last we saw of peak Tmac). He also clamped down on Glenn Big Dawg Robinson so bad he was calling him lil puppy despite losing that series. Tmac could check PG's who loved to post/feel you but not the speedsters.

Basically, Kobe was better 1-2, Tmac was better at checking 3's and 4's (back when that was a differentiating positional marker).",nba

"He is genuinely terrible. Warriors fans feel some bizarre need to defend him, but watch his last 2 years in Dallas and LA. He was 100% healthy in LA, said he was close to being in the best shape of his life and he was legitimately one of the worst players in the NBA. 

I’m 100% convinced not a single person in this thread has watched him play since he left GS, besides a 1 min highlight reel in Australia. They’re in for a treat if he ever steps on the floor in GS, which he almost certainly won’t. 

This desperate need for homers to pretend every bad player on their team is actually good is quite a phenomenon. Look at some of these comments.",nba
"You're implying that just because harden was forced into taking on a bigger role in the offense, we should turn a blind eye to an increase in his production. If it were that easy, everyone would do it. If every player could become the best offense in the league by himself with insane usage, all while remaining injury free and without alienating the locker room, every player would do it. But they can't. There's probably 5 other players who have held a basketball that can do it, tops.

"As stated in the OP, Drummond also has the highest career rebound percentage, which helps account for varying paces across eras.

It's also entirely possible that at 25 years old, Drummond hasn't even reached his peak yet.

Rodman's rebounding peak didn't begin until age 30, and it's conceivable we haven't seen Drummond's best either.",nba
"I fully admit that I'm salty. It's fine if you think KAT is better (I personally have Gobert just ahead, with both of them right around 15th in the league), but the only way it's ""clearly not close"" is if you only care about ppg. Gobert has been the best player each year on a Jazz team that has gotten to the 2nd round of the playoffs two years in a row and is most likely making the playoffs again this year, while Towns has only squeaked into the playoffs once, when Butler was arguably their most important player. KAT is a better offensive player, but the gap in offensive impact is either similar or closer than the gap in defensive impact. But there's no easy points per game equivalent for defense, so it's unappreciated by most fans.",nba
"Prayers and dumb luck. I wish I could give a motivational speech or something on how I turned being a nobody on the internet into making a living but I really can't. I really just got lucky. 

I basically battled severe depression and anxiety my whole life to the point where I literally couldn't do school, couldn't retain information to study, couldn't find a job, had no social life. I spent all of my time just completely engrossing myself in sports as a coping mechanism. I used things like posting news to reddit or being an active member of internet forums as an escape. Somehow found myself above 1 million karma and with a good understand of how the media works. 

Somewhere along the way I completely lucked into finding the woman of my dreams who knew how to bring me up from where I was. I started feeling better, feeling more encouraged. I finally found myself being able to apply to jobs, things I could see myself doing with what little credentials I had. One place I applied to just happened to be very interested in my high karma count and my knowledge of sports and social media. I got an interview over the phone and two months later, I got an invite to join the team. 

Once again, I basically lucked into a really good situation. Found myself working for a very new and very ambitious company with a lot of open spaces. Started working my way up immediately and suddenly I was running the project I was originally just signed on to be part of as an intern.

I wish I had a better story of perseverance or dedication that I could use to help people who are in the same situation I was in. I want nothing more than to help someone else get out of that.

"To be honest we don’t even need his defense to be as good as some people are hyping it up to be. We just need a guy who puts in the effort every single game. When Willie is locked in, I swear he plays DPOY type defense. The problem is his effort is so god damn inconsistent, that we rarely get to see it. There will be certain games where it’s close in the 4th and he just locks in and helps swing the game in our favor. Other games, it will be close and he’ll stand there watching a guy get a offensive rebound and go back up for an easy bucket. It’s so frustrating.

"The whole point is to make the call offsite.  You do not put it on pause with the exception of shooting a technical freethrow.  That is NOT a big deal in game flow.   And, you know, corrects teh missec call garnered through poor sportsmanship?

Seriously, how could you POSSIBLY see ""let's get the flop called correctly and undo the mistake"" and think ""This is punishing the team that flopped?""  This is correcting the game state.  If you don't want the game state corrected away from you, then don't flop.

I'm a teacher.  If kids want to get away with crap, I know for a fact that they usually will, because I have too damned much going on to catch the truly motivated ones.

As for flops not called, handle it the way the league already has rules for - but actually DO IT.

What's worse, a 6 point swing in a tight game because a player fooled the refs into blowing a call, or getting the damn call right a couple minutes later to correct the mistake?

"He never reached his prime.  We only saw his early stages.  Think like Paul George before he got injured.  That's where Roy was before injuries took him.

Also, keep in mind, he played on one of the slowest teams in NBA history so his stats don't seem as impressive on paper.

On a more moderate paced team, he would probably average an extra 1-3 ppg.  For example, in his last healthy season, Roy had per 100 possession numbers that were comparable to James Harden at the same age (which Harden averaged 25 ppg on a faster team).  Therefore, it's not unlikely that his trajectory would've gone the same route as Wade or Harden.

After all, this is the same guy who prime Artest and prime Kobe said, at one point, were the hardest for them to defend and who Kobe respected for being the only guy in the league other than himself as having zero weaknesses.

That's not an understatement as Roy had just about every move in his game.  He could drive to the rim in an unblockable way (rated one of the lowest shots blocked in paint among guards), had a strong midrange that would probably only get better over  time, could juke/spin/side step, improved his three ball every season, had incredibly clutch stats (with low assisted shot rates, meaning he often willed the team to victory).

His biggest weakness was defense but even that was average and was steadily improving.

Style-wise, he was kind of like Kawhi mixed with Demar Derozan.  Not flashy but possesses penetration, slashing, mid-range, and in Kawhi's case, the three ball.

But his traits are a lot of like Doncic's where he's poised, clutch, smart, well-rounded, could handle ball, good shot selection, possesses strong fundamentals, has excellent leadership, and is fun to watch - all on top of being a nice guy.

In today's game, he'd be the #2 SG behind Harden with the potential to get to Wade level greatness imo.  I don't say that lightly.  It's just that watching Lillard and watching Harden, Roy might not be as great of a shooter so he wouldn't go for crazy offensive streaks but he'd be like Lebron and CP3 in the sense that he is extremely consistent and has few weaknesses.",nba
"That's very true, but it's also worth noting that there were fewer in the 2000s than the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s or 90s.

"Big oof. Is this why I’m getting downvoted? Ok, back up. You know why Harden didn’t win in 2015? Because the media convinced themselves there was no difference between the Rockets getting the 2-seed with 55 wins and the 6-seed with 54 wins. If the only reason the Rockets were in the 2-seed was due to other teams playing 1 or 2 games worse than they could’ve, and not having anything to do with Harden, then, the argument went, the 2-seed is not really a reflection of his value. And since he could easily be the 6-seed, how is that the MVP? 

That’s basically how it went. I’m pushing back against that. It matters because he actually was the 2-seed, and it matters now because he actually is the 3-seed. You don’t get to play make-believe land and say “well they could be the 5” because the inevitable result of that line of thinking is ”how is that the MVP?” If the MVP can’t be on a 5-seed (outside of 2016), which everyone seems to accept, then there should be a strong pushback against the “well there’s no difference between the Rockets being the 3 and 5 seed.” There is a difference, he actually is on the 3-seed, he’s not on the 5, so give him his due.

"First, I would start a coaching search.  Saunders will be one of the candidates, not the only one.  I would want a coach that would have a clear plan for improving the defense and would modernize the offense, building around KAT.

I would consider packaging Teague and Saric in a trade - not sure Saric is best fit next to KAT.  I’d let Rose walk, probably keep Tyus assuming he is very cheap to retain.  I’d view Tyus as a keeper at backup PG, Covington on the wing, and Okogie as a potential backup.

Since team does not have a clean cap sheet, I’m doing everything I can to get the best possible player on the MLE.  This move will be influenced by the draft.  I hope the Teague/Saric grade returns a starting player for one position, and draft/MLE takes care of another position.

Wiggins will get floated, but his value is at a nadir now and so I’d wait til his contract is closer to expiring before trading him barring unforeseen interest in him from another team.  At this point, I am willing to consider starting him next season as team looks for a trade, but I would not mind if coach benches him if his play doesn’t improve - and I would want a coach to take kid gloves off, really work to revamp Wiggins game.  As in, ban him from long twos, design actions for him cutting to rim until he does it on his own, get him to work on three point shooting, bench him during games when he isn’t engaged, play him fewer minutes.  I’d want the coaching hire to be empowered to really use whatever tools they had to coach up Wiggins.",nba

One game elimination tournament where last year's tourney winner and last year's NBA finals winner get a bye in the first round. That's hype. It's like March Madness only with better players, better teams, and the incentive is financially motivating these players to actually try.

Also the resting rules wouldn't apply, so if you wanna rest your stars go ahead, but the idea of the tourney is awesome.

Also would allow them to introduce the supercup, which is a match that ceremoniously opens up the season (doesn't count toward record) with a game between the NBA finals champ and the Tourney champ.

Americans don't understand that these european soccer tournaments have financial incentive and are prestigious cups. In fact the Champions League is far more prestigious than a league championship. Perhaps this is a step towards having a basketball champions league that includes the NBA, which would be so fucking legit.

Actually, it's the other way around.  I was arguing for the status quo (I agree with the supreme court's ruling).  The comment I was responding to was suggesting we need to pass laws that limit political contributions.  The burden of proof is generally on the side advocating for change.

This article only highlights which countries use which systems, it doesn't actually examine the ins-and-outs of campaign finance except a brief look at Germany .

As it turns out, I think the German system is a better system.  They have even fewer restrictions on political contributions than the U.S. (no restrictions at all).  Instead of trying to regulate campaign contributions (a fool's errand as I said in my original comment), they regulate what political money can be spent on.  Critically, political television ads (which constitute the majority of U.S. political spending) aren't allowed.  Stopping TV ads is easily enforceable (unlike stopping political contributions) and can dramatically reduce the impact of money on election results.",nba

Honestly, the only reason he hasn’t been waived is because he’s a franchise icon, I haven’t watched many Mavs games, but from looking at stats, it seems like he’s actually hurting more than helping the team. He’s scoring 6 ppg, while shooting 33.7% from the field, and 28% from three, while providing almost no defense and rebounding. He’s really more of a mentor at this point, and he can easily do that by just joining the coaching staff next year.

"Wallstar is right I have seen plenty of “reasonable” level headed fans act like the idea of Duncan &gt; Kobe is laughable and use at least somewhat relevant stats to defend it. 

That being said the problem on /r/nba is more often kids shit talking Kobe and vastly underrating him, not Duncan. Really everything is a problem here though. And people who think longevity is Tim’s best skillset. Kobe may have lasted longer as a championship level superstar than Tim did; I think Tim has the best prime argument. Tim was still playing elite defense until his last season and was a great offensive big to rely on finishing/screening/passing/ with the ability to still post up on anyone and get a shot at times. I have too hard a time remedying comparing that with Kobe’s skillset scoring and running pick and roll like a superstar til his Achilles where as Duncan was dominating in a secondary role. Duncan was probably still our most important player even on both Finals runs. If he didn’t have as good of offensive teammates all around him I don’t think Duncan can drag us to the Finals though. I really don’t like trying to compare these two like I’ve tried a couple times on here over the years. You know of course I’m picking Timmy but they’re playing such different roles. Timmy still had the offensive dominance along with defense in his prime and I feel that’s the biggest separator. Tim suffered injuries that clearly hampered his ability after only ~6 years in the league.

Some people also shoot better and angle then they do straight on, my favourite spots at the three point line are the 45 degree angle to the basket, and my worst possible shooting spot, is front on. 

You also have the annoying voice in the back of your head saying “don’t miss, don’t miss, don’t miss” and the fact you have time to nail each shot. Shooting in game becomes more of a reflex, whilst free throw shooting can become more of a workout.

And Cousins with 3.0 and Looney at 2.7 are getting more screen assists per game than Draymond at 2.5, but is that the team integrating Boogie to demonstrate his value or is he actually going to be more involved than Draymond in the playoffs. 

I think when basketball actually matters Draymond will revert to a larger role with his typical 9 shots per game and moving screener, but who knows with Kerr's decision making.

"&gt; A lot of people see the clippers as a huge player in the FA market this year, and if we do land a Kawhi or a KD I think we become real contenders with this core.

What matters though is whether the *players* see the Clippers that way. I haven't seen anyone say that KD is even considering the Clippers, and like I said above, just yesterday came the report that the Raptors are more confident than ever that he's staying in Toronto. No big name free agent has *ever* chosen the Clippers. Not once. 

The only major stars the Clippers have ever had were drafted by them or traded there, and Chris Paul demanded a trade *away* from the Clippers. After he was gone, Blake Griffin was the Clippers best player and they traded him away. In exchange they got Tobias Harris who became their new best player and then they traded him away too. The Clippers have the same coach who was there for all the failed Lob City playoff runs, except now the guy who was Doc's assistant coach is instead his boss as the GM.

The Clippers have put themselves in a good position to pitch free agents, sure. They've got good young players and two max slots this summer, but you know who else was in that exact same position a year ago? That's right: the Lakers. You gotta actually get those guys to sign with you or else it's just a fool's errand. And the Clippers will have plenty of competition this summer for those players, as they're far from the only team with max cap space. Maybe it works out for the Clippers, but it's far too early to be proclaiming victory on that front.",nba

Overall I’d give it a really high 8 out of 10, it’s a great movie, definitely in the upper level of marvel movies.

Since I know some people are concerned about this, no it isn’t a “political movie”. There’s no secret agenda or whatever. Is it a “feminist movie”? Yes it is, in that important characters are women.

We have Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber who have improved steadily in their young careers, and Maxi at one point this season had the second highest defensive rating in the NBA and has potential to be a solid 3&amp;D guy, and can finish lobs. We have THJ who has the potential to be much better than he was in New York now that he has a playmaker like Luka feeding him. 

We have Trey Burke who, like many others on the Mavs, has a ton of potential to be a solid role player for this team. We have Giannis’s lil brother, an as of yet unproven commodity who may one day (not saying it *will* happen, just that it *may*) reach something like Giannis’s level, hell if he even reaches 50% of Giannis’s level he’ll contribute. We have Courtney Lee, who’s admittedly not great and may have already reached his ceiling but with guys like that you never know when they elevate their game when the team dynamic changes and you get some superstars going. 

With Luka and KP and all of Dallas’s cap space to max a third star and/or completely retool the bench, Dallas clearly has the brighter future and it isn’t close. In fact it is ludicrous to suggest otherwise. And if Dallas can get a top 5 pick this draft that will be the cherry on top. Either we get a young stud or trade for another piece.

"I watched a lot of Mavs games, and this what I observed in regards to Dirk not shooting as many threes (I think you are right to say it wasn’t just the era, but to imply he wasn’t as lethal from three as is commonly understood would also be fallacious)- 

The entire Mavs offense, once he had his fade away fully developed, revolved around him being able to hit the mid range shot no matter the circumstance. The Mavs schemed to take advantage of Dirks  gravity at the elbows and it was so effective that putting dirk in a position to hit more threes actually made the other players on the Mavs LESS effective, actually hurting perimeter play because the guards and wings couldn’t take advantage of that unique circular gravity (both at the rim and on the perimeter) when he wasnt in midrange position. In many ways they were kinda running a modified drive and kick, replacing an elite slashers drive to the rim to open up the perimeter with a dirk post up/face up/pick n pop at elbow range. 

I haven’t watched much KAT, but from what I have seen, his midrange game is not the same game warping tool like Dirks, at least not yet. Dirk is at the very least a top five midrange guy ever, so I don’t think it’s all that  “[un]grounded in reality” to say Dirk is still quite a bit ahead of him.

That other executive is more accurate I think, in that he is just a complimentary player, and should not be getting comparisons to stars like Melo.",nba

This is probably what you meant but just to clarify, it's literally impossible to pay a true superstar enough because the cap doesn't allow it (for example, Prime Lebron was estimated to be worth $50-75 million on an open market, back when max salaries were under $25 mill).  Similarly, superstar rookies (or even just very good ones, like Tayshaun Prince or Malcolm Brogdon) can't get paid what they're worth.  The 3rd common case is guys taking a discount (like the Heatles).

But if you're saying we can replace him with somebody of Beal's value, then it's not a debate at all. If the Warriors replaced Klay Thompson with Bradley Beal, they would be a better team.",nba
"I actually didn’t answer your question right. I didn’t put Toronto there with Celtics and Sixers because I think the Bucks have guys to deal with Kawhi; Brown is really stocky, Snell is a pretty good defender, Giannis can probably take Kawhi in isolation too since Kawhi can’t really blow by him. Mirotic is also really strong and IMO not a bad defender, he did valiantly vs the warriors last playoffs. Ilyasova and Wilson have shown decent nous on the perimeter too. You can throw some of these guys at Siakam too, Siakam is a bit quicker so Ilyasova or Mirotic wouldn’t work at all but like with DJ Wilson, Connaughton, Snell, Brown, Giannis etc. you’ve got some guys to throw at him. 

If Siakam can score 20+ a night I think the Raptors have a great chance, but overall I think the Bucks just have more guys who can get into the paint, also I think their bench is better. ",nba

"Makes me wonder, in this hypothetical deal, imagine if Giannis just requested a trade a year or two into the deal. Would that be the biggest trade asset in NBA history?

I believe you're looking at the odds for the first overall pick, which is completely different than drawing top 4 and moving up in the lottery.

EDIT: Right now it's also almost the same odds that the Mavs get the #1 pick as it is they get the #6 pick, so there's only an 8% chance that the Hawks would get #6. They'll likely be looking at a 7/8 pick if everything ended today",nba
"I didn't use PER, so that one is out. I screwed up going back and forth and you are right, Dame, edges Joker in the other three categories last year. Very, very good catch. Caused me to go through and check the rest of my work. Here are the results (note: I added PER) 

The other numbers are all correct though. 

2016/17   

Jokic -  5.3 VORP, 8.3 Box +/-, 9.7 win shares, .228 WS/48, 6.73 RPM, 126 offensive rating, 109 defensive rating, 26.3 PER

Dame - 4.3 VORP, 4.3 Box +/-, 10.4 Win Shares, .185 WS/48, 3.14 RPM, 118 offensive rating, 113 defensive rating, 24.3 PER. 

2017/18

Jokic - 5.6 VORP, 7.1 Box +/-, 10.7 WS, .211 WS/48, 5.97 RPM, 121 offensive rating, 107 defensive rating, 24.4 PER

Dame - 5.9 VORP, 6.9 Box +/-, 12.6 WS, .222 WS/48, 4.90 RPM, 120 Offensive rating, 109 defensive rating, 25.2 PER

208/19 - 

Jokic - 6.4 VORP, 9.8 Box +/-, 10.6 WS, .236 WS/48, 6.01 RPM, 120 offensive rating, 105 defensive rating, 26.8 PER

Dame - 4.7 VORP, 5.5 Box +/-, 10.5 WS, .207 WS/48, 4.45 RPM, 121 Offensive rating, 112 defensive rating, 24.0 PER

So what do we have over a three year period?

2016/17 - Jokic  7 - 1    (Dame wins WS, Joker gets the rest)

2017/18 - Tie 4 - 4  (Dame takes WS, WS/48, Vorp and per)

2018/19 - Jokic 7 - 1   (Dame takes offensive rating 121 to 120) 

Total - Jokic 18 - 6  

Good catch on my mistake. My point still stands that Jokic is the better player and the line ""Jokic has one season where he could even be mentioned in the same sentence with Lillard"" is wrong. 

You cheer for a wonderful player and I love the guy immensely. I just see Jokic as better and the advanced stats agree with my take. ",nba
"How can a coach make WB take bad shots, stand around on offense if he doesn't have the ball and take defensive plays off? That has nothing to do with coaching and everything to do with being self aware. If you're the least efficient guy on the floor why are you putting up more shots than the most efficient guy on your team and one of the most efficient in the league? If you're one of the fastest guys to ever play the game with the ball and can get anywhere on the floor you want, why aren't you driving to the lane for buckets, fouls or to dish to sub 40% 3pt catch and shooters? Again, one of the fastest in the league, so why stand around on offense when you don't have the ball when you could be cutting to or from the basket, setting screens and generating good looks for yourself and others? If you're the primary ball handler why aren't you creating shots and mismatches for Adams through pick and rolls. But yeah you're right those are all because of bad coaching. I'm sure BD is telling him to iso and take contested jumpers.",nba

"My bad, I was reading the other thread too much...

Bucks lost in the first round last year because everyone other than Giannis and Middleton underperformed, right? Both gave their best but still couldn't get past Boston.

In 2016-17 season, nobody other than Giannis played that series with passion. It was a humiliating series.

Miami LeBron on the other hand...he was putting up damn good numbers and had teammates of that calibre in Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. Ray Allen and Mario Chalmers off the bench helped too. That was a championship legacy team. They were something else entirely. They reached the finals four consecutive times- from 2010-11season.

2013 playoff LeBron was not gonna lose whatever happened, it was fantastic. His passion/motivation alone was so influential for the team, it really did get the best of them out.

"Obviously we haven't seen one yet. I was talking about out of 3.8 billion people, at least one of them probably has the athleticism to play in the NBA. Lieberman had the skill, not the athleticism. If one of those athletes had been playing all their lives they'd have a chance.

I mean, do you honestly think Lieberman is the best female athlete out there? I sure as hell don't. Purely from an athleticism standpoint, she might be the most skilled but she isn't the most athletic.

My point was that out of 3.8 billion, there's probably a few who are elite athletes. At least on the athletic level of bench NBA players. If they start playing sports at a young age they can make it. That's why I say in 15 years or so, because more and more women are playing sports.

I just think the sample size is too large for their not to be an outlier.",nba
"Then we're back to my original point. Can Dame handle all the pounding for 82 games that comes with the responsibility of being the sole ball handler? The new player either helps him by taking possesions away from him, thus not being different than the current situation, or help him by putting numbers without needing the ball but then Dame may pay the price for those extra possesions that may up his numbers",nba
I mean if steph took like a giannis volume of threes I’d imagine he’d shoot significantly over 50% from 3 but that just means taking one more and another and another is still such a good scoring option that he takes more.  Basically if a guy is shooting 50% from 3 it means he should take more and more contested ones because those will still be efficient shots. ,nba

Let's not even get into the fact that Giannis is doing all this on 32.9 mpg while Harden is over 37. Bud could gas our star in the regular season and bad his offensive stats easily with an extra 4+ mpg but he manages his load and doesn't need him to bail the Bucks out every night.

They could see the Jazz, Rockets or Blazers in round 1. And I’m not sure if I’d favor them in any of those series. They seem to match up well with the Rockets, but then I remember that the Thunder beat the Rockets early in the season when the Rockets sucked, then the Rockets beat the Thunder when Chris Paul was hurt. Then the Thunder needed to come back from a 26 point deficit to beat the Rockets without Clint Capela. I feel like Ingles and the Jazz have the Thunder’s number from last season. That leaves Portland, which has been playing well. Nurkic has taken a leap.",nba
"You're literally excusing him for not playing defense when most of his defensive issues are a straight up lack of basic effort. 

Time after time in the 3rd and 4th last night he just refused to slide over in help. Let guys have layups instead of escaping the paint on the drive. 

It just effort. A lack of it on a ridiculous level. ",nba
"Yes indeed, he does. He has better stats all around than Giannis, not by a long shot but indeed if stats was the *only* thing that mattered on the MVP race I would support Harden.

Also my RPM argument was (and is) that it is very bad statistic. I am sniping it now because I see it referenced a lot , yet few would disparage it as much as they should.

Being better than unadjusted PM is not a very good argument though. Because (a) it is not as good as other stats, (b) it clouds the one thing that unadjusted PM does well, show which teams / lineups dominate the most. 

So it is bad as an advanced statistic *and* it is bad on the one thing that PlusMinus is actually helpful. So I have to ask again what its use may be.",nba
I know the truth lies in the middle. But we only know what Westbrook claims to have heard. Conveniently the fan will deny shouting what Russ told the media. Clearly something was said to trigger a response like that. All we know for sure is Russ told a fan he would fuck him and his wife up. Not a good look no matter how he tries to justify it you know? ,nba

Yes, Tmac was a shit defender in his finest season but even that season I can pull up articles detailing his stellar defensive efforts come playoffs. Much like Kobe (in similarly offensive oriented roles), he only got up for the big names (I have games where he locks up guys like VC/Pierce) and often got lit up by role players because he didn't pay enough attention off the ball. 

Kobe was a better defender throughout his career but he was also blessed with more support overall.

As strong, smart and good as Draymond is (and this sub constantly underrates him), he could not make up the strength and size difference against him.  The whole nut kicking bullshit was embarrassing and probably should have resulted in a 1 game suspension.  Then Draymond goes into the finals, loses his cool against LeBron, and gets the 1 game suspension he deserved in the WCF.  LeBron instigated that and probably should have gotten a 1 game, but if he got away with it against OKC LeBron gets away with it against us.  Draymond anchors our offense and defense.  Losing him was hugely important, and the series turned there.  Draymond played the best game of his career trying to make up for that fuck up, and we lost anyway.

"I get Kyrie being frustrated for the same reason IT was frustrated. Good players don't like losing and they wouldn't like thinking about giving up games now so they are better prepared to beat a team they already probably think they can beat. 


But the coach's job is to prep the team for those situations.

*** 

&gt;I don’t really get practicing single coverage on Kemba though [/giving him space]

I think that's exactly why though, we don't need to gameplan and practice playing against Kemba/Charlotte because we're not likely to face that situation in the playoffs.

In the entire Eastern Conference, there are only 5 guards who can even play like Kemba can:

1. Kemba - Not likely to face him in the playoffs
2. Kyrie - On our team
3. Dlo - Only if they beat the Raptors and Philly (and we get to the ECF)
4. Dipo - Injured
5. Lowry - Has been cold all season (30% on pull-up 3s specifically)

We don't really have to worry about a PG who can pull-up comfortably unless we get to the finals and the teams we have to prepare to face (IND, MIL, TOR/PHI) have pretty diversified offences, they aren't running everything through one guy and they can punish you for double-teaming. 


But also, 1v1 defence is really a point of pride for Boston. It started in the Doc Rivers era and has continued through Brad Stevens' tenure, [Boston's 1v1 defence is why we've been the best 3PT defensive team in the league over the past several years. 
](https://www.nba.com/article/2018/09/25/one-team-one-stat-boston-celtics-3-point-defense) All our guys are expected to be able to hold their own 1v1.

Playing 1v1 might allow stars to go off, but it normally limits the rest of the team. Booker's 70 point game is probably the best example of this.

Last playoffs, Cleveland and Philly both averaged 30% from 3 against Boston and Milwaukee did in the games when Smart was playing too.

"I am torn.

I wasn't a proponent of the trade before it happened. Afterwards, I'm trying to see the upside.

It's clear that Gasol is having a big impact outside of stats. Lowry's playing much better, the spacing is evident and we've seen the momentum shifting charges taken too. But stats wise he hasn't been great. His shot has been a little off and his post scoring isn't near JV's level.

Meanwhile, JV was never going to be the passer or perimeter shooter that Gasol is. But he was super efficient in the post, a bit of a better rebounder I think, younger and I think a bit better defensively at this point. No, he's not going to be switching anytime soon but his rim protection had been excellent and Gasol isn't really quick on his feet either.

I don't know. I'll have to wait til playoffs to make a judgment on it. It's great to see the team hum like it can now with Gasol's passing, but when Gasol's shot is off, it's tough watching JV put up 20/10 on the Grizz regularly.",nba

"&gt;By your logic Curry is the tenth best 3pt shooter cause that’s what the stats say

jesus my brain, Curry is shooting 43% on 11.8 attempts a game, how ""by my logic"" is he 10th? I accounted for volume when comparing their driving and efficiency, if you care so much, go find the TS% of their driving after you remove the 3pt shot from it.",nba
"By that reasoning Giannis' TS% was 50%, essentially the same as Westbrooks, but he had more turnovers to assists. If 7 assists to 4 turnovers is bad then how is 4 assists to 5 turnovers? He also shot nearly 15% below his average fg% compared to Harden who shot 10% less. Im not saying that he played worse than Harden. Also, if EG and PJ went 1/16 tonight (for a whopping 6% TS%) and took more shots, I don't think they would've suddenly converted so much more to offset Harden's scoring and assisting. In fact, the Rockets as a whole had a lower TS% than Harden. Point is, even though Harden played bad, his team would've done unquestionably worse without him.",nba
"Yeah, he just dove at Westbrooks legs leading to him tearing his meniscus and then proceeded to dive at them again once Westbrook came back healthy and once again this year.

Yeah I don't see it. Wade is primarily a slasher and while Jordan could slash Jordan's game revolved around his mid range game and being a elite defender.

"&gt; You do realise that if the refs called every single travel, every single carry, every single lane violation, the game would be so fucking boring.

&gt; Look at how everyone gets their panties in a twist when the refs call stupid techs like staring or fist bumping.

Totally different. Techs are subjective... traveling/lane violations/line violations are not.

&gt; Basketball may be a sport but the NBA is entertainment.

So where are the refs supposed to ""draw the line?"" It's gotta be somewhere between ""basketball"" and ""The Harlem Globetrotters"" I guess, right? It just seems silly to me to allow some rules to be broken, but others to be enforced. It's a total double standard and it's confusing to watch. And it's not just the viewers... watch any NBA bench and during play you'll see the coaching staff signaling ""travel"" about 8 times throughout the game. I guess it's harder for a coach to forget about the rules of basketball than a player.

I guess that's subjective too. I know a lot of people who don't want to watch NBA basketball because it's hard to watch the game when rules aren't enforced.

"I've been to Utah/SLS only once in my life, and my experience mirrors yours closely.

Took a visit to the LDS church and the people there were nothing but nice and civilized. They were very forthcoming in sharing about their religion, and some might even construe it to be a little pushy, but never once did I feel that they overstepped the boundaries and made myself or my friends feel uncomfortable.

In general, the people there were really nice. On average, far more friendly, warm and personable than the folks down in the major cities such as SF/LA.

It may just have been the luck of selection, but the food there was really good. It's been nearly half a decade now but I can still remember having some of the best scones in one of the cafes there.

And of course, the nature. SLS and the surrounding vicinity is amazing enough, but there's tons of other great places like Zion/Arches. One of the greatest regrets I have (only getting more into hiking/outdoorsy stuff in the last couple of years) was not spending more time out in such a beautiful state.

So yeah. Every city/state has its charms, but SLS/Utah I hold in especially high regard. Which makes me somewhat perplexed whenever some people talk about it so negatively, or just brush it aside as a non-topic whenever travel destinations are talked about.

Surely, as with any place, there are downsides that exist, which probably come up if you spend a little more time and get to know the darker side of things. But it's a far, far cry, in my experience, from the 'almost nothing redeeming' stigmatization that seems to exist in certain circles. ",nba

"&gt; Amir Johnson, Jonathon Simmons, Furkan Korkmaz, Justin Patton will all most likely be gone plus Bolden hasnt been too impressive

Exactly. I love Amir's presence as a locker room guy but he can't keep up anymore. Boban is most likely gone too, he can't defend very well and isn't potent enough on offense to backup Jojo. J Simmons, Kork, Patton are definitely gone, and Bolden has shown flashes but just like Kork, hasn't been able to stay consistent, and he fouls *way* too much at the moment to stay out there. I love TJ's intensity and mindset, I think he's worth keeping around for chemistry (which I think is super important for this team) but he can't be relied upon to get heavy minutes at all.

Getting Jojo a quality backup will be huge for our bench, and hopefully Zhaire and Shake are ready to come off the bench next year and be effective.

1) Availability of free agents - they still have Dray for 1 year, so if they max Klay, even if KD walks they don't have cap space to sign anyone. They still need to flesh out their bench as well.

As for Curry not getting whistles: he's shooting about as many free throws per game on average this season as he has in his career, but he's doing it while shooting more of his field goals from three. Which means he's likely getting more calls his way because most fouls are taken at the rim.

"The reason it's different if the player wants to play or not comes down to whether the player is willing to cooperate with the team if they try to give a legit reason for why the player is sitting. In 2017 in response to many teams (like the Spurs, most notably) simply resting fully healthy players, the league drafted new rules to penalize such practices, and they did so because they felt like it was bad for the game and the fans for healthy players to be sitting out games.

So if the Lakers go to LeBron (or vice versa) and say they are going to tell the league he's hurt and needs to rest, and he agrees to go along with that, then that's the end of it. But if the Pels go to AD and tell him they want to sit him and are gonna say he's too injured to play and tells them he's fine and if they try to sit him he'll file a grievance with the league, then the team is screwed, because you can't sit healthy players and not get punished.",nba

"It was fucked because Harden lost to a guy with somewhat similar numbers because that guy had a better record, and then lost to Westbrook while having similar numbers despite having a better record. Whether he loses this year or not, he was clearly screwed out of one of those MVPs by inconsistent voting criteria. It’s not like Giannis could win and people could just now start shouting “inconsistency!!” now, everybody’s been saying that shit.

A lot of guys have unique statistical seasons. Like Giannis. You have to go back to 1962 (the same year Wilt scored 50, ironically enough) to find a 25/12/6 season from anyone other than Giannis. Per 100 possessions, no one even gets close to his 38/18/8. You remove assists and you still only get two other seasons ever. You remove points and you only get two seasons ever. Then you get into the efficiency and the gap between him and everybody else gets even bigger. There’s never been an all-round threat like him.

But that’s not even really the point I’m arguing, if we’re trying to rank them I’d certainly say Harden’s season is *more* unique than Giannis’. The point is that “well Westbrook won so team record barely even matters now” is a terrible take and we have no idea if it’s even true.

Players hit free agency sooner and they get the choice if they want to stick around on tanking teams.  If your front office can sell them on the vision it's not an issue.

The Knicks and Cavs are exempt having lost Love and Porzingis for designating them and losing them for over half the year.  ",nba

Because if we're being honest the Hou floor spacing isn't great. CP is at 34% from 3 this year. Eric Gordon is rising up to 34% but he's probably their best floor spacer. Shumpert is at 34% for his career. Gary Clark 30%. Austin Rivers 33% this year. Gerald Green 35%. You already know Capela is a rim runner not a floor spacer. PJ at 38% is good but you know his game is parking in the corners there's still the other parts of the court to space. Point is if House regresses back to how he shot last year(and he was only a 33-34% 3 point shooter in college) not sure how much Hou can really play him in series especially when Capela is on the court.

That's not really the standard we usually use for dynasties, though, because most teams never get to be that dominant in the first place. The Spurs are/were definitely a dynasty, even though they didn't have better than 50/50 odds to win the title in preseason. Even if KD leaves, Steph, Klay, and Draymond will remain good enough for 50-60 wins for the next few years; after that, it starts to be a question of what kind of talent they can bring in, or if Steph ages unusually well (not unprecedented for PGs in his mold).",nba
"He traveled, there is no two steps rule in basketball. There is only the establishment of a pivot foot and then what you do with the ball after that pivot foot comes off the floor. On his last dribble (from right to left hand) he establishes his left foot as his pivot, then he moves right foot then left again (here's where travel occurred). Then actually even the right foot again before he goes up for the shot. Once that left foot came off the floor the second time he has to shoot or pass before it touches the ground again.

EVEN IF you tried to argue that the left step is a ""gather step"" and thus the right step established his pivot, he still would have traveled.

"To clarify, a legal zone within the rules of illegal defense is completely different from an actual zone defense. What your point is missing out on is that teams also took tremendous offensive advantage of the 3 or so seconds where you were unable to double team the off ball man receiving a pass for an iso play while his four teammates sprint out and stand beyond the three point line. This created artificial spacing that you cannot recreate in today's game. 

If you'd like to learn, [this 14 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM_eCnTNt1Q) does a great job at explaining what the illegal defense rules were and the impact removing them had on the NBA.

You mentioned Kawhi &amp; Gasol / Simmons &amp; Embiid.

Danny Green is shooting 45% from 3 and is still a highly above average defensive player who can either give Reddick fits or at least hassle Jimmy some. Siakam is a menace and Lowry is still a dude, even with his back and ankle fucked up.

And when they do have to go to the bench, Ibaka and Van Vleet are startable NBA players and Anunoby at least has the length to bother guys on D, with Powell having his best offensive season by some metrics, and the sixers had to demolish their depth to build that starting 5.

It's really just an unlucky matchup for Philly.

They'd need Jimmy Buckets to go crazy for the entire series. Which could happen, but then they can switch Kawhi onto him and have Danny Green hassling Simmons or put a longboi like Siakam or Anunoby on him.

And fuck, even if Simmons gets Lowry in the post, he's actually a very good post defender. But that would be a big advantage to Simmons to have Lowry on him.

"Did LA locked Lebron up...or did Lebron locked Lakers up for 3 years ? From what we've seen. Lebron got his preferred location for his 'market' and 'business' as well as his family in Los Angeles. And the Basketball seems to be secondary. He is gonna decline in the next 3 years and he already ruined the future of the team with the moves that were made to 'please' him. He shafted the whole team just to try to get AD and that failed. No stars want to come to LA and suffer under LEbron's declining shadow and get the blame for HIS failures. And with each year, Lakers will be ruined more and more as a franchise because thats what Lebron does to the teams he went. 

Real talk, Lakers don't need Lebron's fame as they are already BIGGER than Lebron as a franchise in the NBA history. For them to cave to his whims and ruin the foreseeable future ? It is sad to see. He is not winning the chip as long as the ELITE Western teams exist and he definitely not winning with the Lakers. 

Honestly, the best thing to do is just cut the cord before either Lakers are ruined more and fail in the offseason with the Free Agency ( as in Overpaying regular starters the superstar money just so they can say 'we signed someone'  because guys like Klay and Kawhi ain't playing with Lebron ) and Lebron declining even more and wasting his declining years in a place where he broke. A trade actually would make sense for Lebron to go to a contending team and Lakers getting some good assets that WOULD attract future stars that are already surpassing Lebron.

Make no mistake, this Lebron is not the Miami or even Cleveland version. Don't expect the same type of deal or even effort for him. Players know it, teams know it, hell even Lebron himself knows it. It is like Shaq...but in a slower degree. He will probably avoid Shaq's twilight years and can still help a team to the playoffs...but not the way it is handled in the Lakers...and his old ''build around me with shooters'' doesn't work anymore where all the GOOD teams CAN play as a team and shoot / defend while you do nothing.

Being realistic, I believe if we only focus on the second half of the season then Trae has a good argument - improving drastically with better shot selection and confidence - performing better than Luka overall on offense. But I don't think ppl watch as many games as they claim and only look at box scores post game. So as excited as I am about Trae and his potential I also can't mince words when it comes to his absolute lack of D. Trae might be the worst defender in the league (I don't know where to find the list/stats to confirm so don't quote me on that - but I would bet he's at the very least bottom 10-15%).

Another reason why Luka probably has it locked down is because the award is called Rookie of the **YEAR** and thus you need to take into account the entire year and not just the games post all-stars. 

With that being said, I wouldn't complain if Trae won although deep down I think it probably wouldn't be fair to Luka.",nba

IF it does then they aren't very professional about their job.  And if it DOES make them worse, perhpas at some point eh NBA fucking DOES something and removes a ref from the league?

Or starts actually making use of the replay center DURING GAMES instead of later.

That was an obvious one.  And you cannot tell me the league does not have the resources to autom,atically review every single ejection that happens in real time.

That should have been reversed by about the time he made it to the locker room.

And then the ref can go ahead and TRY to deal with it for the rest of the game, with everyone knowing he done fucked up once already.

No fine, no loss of games, just everybody knowing immediately that the entire league knows you fucked up and have officially said so.

Then the player gets to return to finish their 30-35 minutes instead of 18.

"&gt; 1990-91

&gt; Penalties for flagrant fouls increased such that an infraction is penalized by two free throw attempts and possession of the ball out-of-bounds. The offender may also be ejected if there is no apparent effort to play the ball and/or, in the official’s judgment, the contact was of such an excessive nature that an injury could have occurred. 

https://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_history.html

That's why shit was so rough in the 80s. That infamous McHale clothesline on Rambis was a common foul, it'd be an ejection and suspension today. 

That rule also coincides exactly with the Bulls finally getting past the Pistons. 

&gt; The Pistons were charged with three flagrant fouls in Game 2, and one flagrant foul and four technicals on Monday. In a play that was shown on numerous television replays, Pippen drove for the basket and was smashed from the front by Laimbeer, and then banged in the back by Rodman. Rodman then pushed him into the stands. Another time, Pippen was on the floor while scrambling to retrieve a ball and called a timeout. Rodman kicked him in the head.

What about doncic and trae tho, they are just 20 and both are putting up much better numbers than tatum!

I'm sure you can make an assumption that beal's numbers when he was younger would have been better without prime wall holding the ball so much too.

Westbrook's team was a 6 seed that didn't utilize the hidden gems strewn around on their roster due to the playstyle Westbrook used to average the triple double.

&gt;You need to contextualise Harden’s performance while you’re contextualising team record though. Without all those injuries, does he take such a ridiculous number of shots and put up historic scoring numbers? Given literally every other year he’s been on the Rockets, seems like the answer is pretty obviously no.

So we should punish players for putting the team on their back and dragging them to success? That's so dumb. That's literally the purpose of an MVP award.

&gt; Lebron missed 18 games, not 40. Hell, Kawhi missed more games and Toronto are doing just fine. Your schedule at that point was 27th in difficulty, it was a mirage.

Only think I'd add is that there were teams like the Rockets who had worse injuries to their rosters and were at like #14 at that point.  Now they're in the 3rd seed.

And anyway offense is still much more valuable than defense. As good as Dikembe, Draymond, Gobert, etc are, you’re not even thinking about taking them over Nash, Curry, Harden, etc. I agree defense is more important than people think but it’s rarely gonna play heavily into an MVP debate. ",nba

"Ok 1st of all don't start dropping obscure acronyms like they're common place terms and secondly almost no one in the history of the game ""obliterates"" Melo offensively certainly not TMac. Just quoting from another post here:   
 
&gt; 06-07: Melo goes for 29/6/4 and makes his first career all-star game. Denver grabs the 6-seed. Dirk, the league MVP, averages 25/9/3... Melo averages 27/9 in the playoffs against San Antonio in a year they won it all and swept LeBron in the Finals. He shoots 48/50/80 in the series, they just don't have enough firepower next to him.

&gt; 07-08: Melo goes for 26/7/3, shoots 49/35/79, and Denver wins 50 games. They get swept by LAL in the first round and LAL goes to the Finals that year. He gets snubbed from the All-NBA teams in favor of Amar'e and and TMac even though he was better than both of them. He averaged more points and more rebounds than TMac and played more games, shot higher percentages too. He just got snubbed.

&gt; 09-10: His last full year in Denver. Averages 28/7/3 and shoots 46/32/83. Denver wins 53 games and grabs the 4-seed in the West. Melo is 6th in MVP voting. They run into a 53-win Utah team in the first round and lose in 6, even though Melo was a beast. He went for 31/9/3 that series. In game one he went for 42 points on 18/25 shooting, then 39/11 in game four. They just ran into a great team way earlier than they should've.

&gt; 12-13: First full NYK season, not counting the lockout the year before. Melo wins the scoring title, shoots 45/38/83 to boot, and finishes third in MVP voting behind LeBron in his prime and a great season from KD. LeBron got 120 of 121 first place votes and Melo had the only other one. Knicks win 54 games and grab the 2-seed, it's their best season since 96-97. Beats Pierce/KG in round one, then fall to Indiana round two. Amar'e only plays 33 minutes the whole series. Melo goes for 29/9 but doesn't get any help. He led both teams in scoring in 4/6 games that series including 39 points on 52% shooting in the closeout game.

The shear amount of underselling that Melo has gotten on this sub is insane if you think there's a stark difference between his scoring ability on the offensive end and Tmac, and that's not to take away from TMac, it's only to remind people of how insane Melo's peak is and Melo was playing at a GREAT not good level for about a decade or so too.  
 
I can definitely see the statement of Tmac has a higher peak than Melo offensively being true, sure. But if you walk in here and say that he obliterates Melo as an offensive player you're just sitting here drinking the shit on Melo reddit Kool-aid.   
 
Especially if you want to talk about their abilities in a 2v2 game now. Melo is stronger and faster than Tmac was and his jumpshot at it's peak was PURE.

"See Nick Collision is a great candidate based on the criteria that many want to see. Sure, he didnt put up the numbers that many guys who have had their jersey retired did. So i can see where someone might have an argument against it. 

But here is a guy that spent his entire career, which was 15 years, with a single franchise. Including the first 10 years of the team when they moved to Oklahoma City. In fact he was the only constant over that period of time. He played in 65+ games a year most of those years. Universally loved and looked up to, both by players and community. Did a LOT to bridge the gap between team and community.  Even Kevin Durant, arguably the best and most successful player to play for the franchise called him Mr. Thunder.  His leadership and mentoring went a long way. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, thats exactly the type of player id like to see get their jersey retired.  Not some dude who played with a team for 6 years and put up decent but not amazing numbers. To get your jersey retired in that short of time with a team you need to have done something amazing, like bring home the championship a few of those years or something. ",nba

That said, I believe that the way the office have gone about pursuing their FAs while destroying their team culture is the key negative effect here. The pelicans forced their hand and it showed the league not only what's on the table but how desperate Lakers are. Even if it's not true, that's the perception I saw.

Magic already has a history of talking too much when he shouldn't and since they failed to keep decorum during trade negotiations, their team fell apart. The only thing that could  have saved the team was a strong run to playoffs but without that, the team doesn't look like it's on the track for success. ",nba

The real fact of the matter is, a cap space exists and it is historically damn hard to keep a team together long enough to 3-peat. History has shown that.

If he can't get paid here and wants to go somewhere else, there's no bitterness because he's given some of his best years to us.

It wasn't until the Anthony Davis trade shit that the team completely fell apart, which was when Lebron was already back in the lineup.

Ultimately what it all boils down to is Magic and Pelinka coming in and accelerating our time frame to win drastically by signing Lebron. My issue isn't with him himself it's with the expectations he brings. With him here the goal then became to gain a second star, like AD which caused the whole trade fuck up.

Even if we didn't hit 31 I would've been cool since the expectation wouldn't have been to win now but to win in the future. Now the expectation is to win which is why being at 31 is embarrassing, I had way more fun watching this team grow last year than fall apart this year.

It’s the summer of 2017 and Jerry West is about to join the Lakers as a “consultant,” which is code for “guy who will tell us what to do and we’ll literally do it without question because he’s the GOAT.” But this is only after Magic has joined the Lakers as President of Operations. Magic knows three things better than almost anyone who’s ever lived: fast break basketball, clutch baby hooks, and how to take credit for success. He sees the writing on the wall. There’s no way he gets any credit, much less ultimate decision making power, with Jerry as “consultant.” So he literally begs Jerry to go somewhere else and tells him, at any point of your choosing, I will trade you any young asset of your choosing in exchange for a garbage stretch 5, no questions asked, as long as you go somewhere else. 

The GOAT thinks it over then tells the clips he’ll only join if they give him an insane $5 million a year just to do whatever the hell he says. Ballmer, of course, jumps on this offer (as absolutely any owner not named Jeannie would). Jerry conveniently waits almost two years until this year when he trades Boban and waives Gortat and tells Magic, “Guess what time it is?” 

At this point, magic learns why you never make a deal with the devil. The devil always wins. The rest will be history. ",nba

Part 2, scoring has been going down from the 80's 90's to 00's. Factually true. 

Context, Pace moves from, at its peak in this time period, 103.1, down to at its lowest point 88.9. Where as offensive Rating similarly is 108.3 down to 102.9 (03-04 I think this might be important later). This change in scoring is probably about 80:20 explained by pace rather than ability to score.

Part 3: Choosing the 21 all-stars is absurdly arbitrary and I feel like you did to support your argument. 

Possible reasons why, all star is a popularity contest, older players are naturally more popular. We have seen them longer. They will not score as much as they age.

Also you chose the 03 all stars which was the second last year, so these players are now another year older. Neat.

Context, Offensive Rating went from 102.9 (03-04) to 106.1 (04-05) the largest single season jump upwards since this stat was established in the 70's

**[Melo last season compared to Tatum this season](http://bkref.com/tiny/arZBU)**

* **Melo**

16.2 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 1.3 apg, 35.7% from 3. .476 eFG%, .503 TS%, .071 WS/48

* **Tatum**

15.9 ppg. 6.2 rpg, 2.1 apg, 36.3% from 3, .506 eFG%, .549 TS%, .101 WS/48

I mean, Tatum this year does kinda look like Melo on the Thunder last year, just with better free throw shooting and defense, but in the halfcourt offense it's otherwise pretty similar numbers.",nba
"I think it's the opposite actually.

Replacement level is pretty high for centers. There are a lot of good ones. 

I mean a guy like Brook Lopez might be around the 20th best center in the NBA, definitely in the 16-20 range, and that's a very nice player. 

You don't need to spend a ton of money to have a quality starting center. ",nba
I mean if you as a fan don’t care about your team winning or losing (against your former coach and potential playoff opponent) that’s your choice. But the players/team clearly cared cause Kawhi and Gasol played 36 and you guys fought hard till the end. It mattered to them for sure ,nba
I guess I will throw the down vote bait out there and say this is good for Lebron. I don't even remember now many times Lebron has been the finals in a row now. However I think finally have a full off season to rest will do wonders for him physically.,nba
Why did people have Kobe&gt;next best player in 2006 or 2007? If you say that he was statistically dominant then that favors Lebron. Lebron had an all time great regular and postseason in 2009. 2009 is where he takes the reigns from Kobe imo. Crushes every stat/advanced stat in existence in the 2009 playoffs. ,nba

He's where he is because of LeBron but my overall point was that he's pretty smart and has good business sense.  Additionally, most people get good jobs because of connections. He's not the first and not the last, but I'm not gonna hold the fact that he met LeBron and parlayed that into owning a Sports Agency against him.

Maybe similar but much more risky due to what the Mavs had to give up for him. They sent away Smith Jr plus had to take on 3 years of Hardaway Jr's terrible contract (and he's a 40% shooting volume chucker) plus 2 years of Courtney Lee. That's a lot to risk beyond Zingers contract.,nba
"Jeez, it's not flopping, flopping would be to act or fall like he got hit when he didn't, Harden creates contact, often extends his arms to make defenders hack him when they think they have a chance to get the ball. Also he gets fouled on 3's more than anyone else because defenders are forced to launch at him bc of the step back and that forces them to either hit his arm or land in his space. Harden has been playing injured so many games this season, everytime he goes to the bench he's got things on his neck or wrist, and people act like the man isn't tough.

"it seems like nobody really watched Fultz in his 33 games. 

I’m one of the biggest Fultz apologists out there and have supported/will continue to support him but he it’s not like he was some incredible point guard outside of his shooting in his limited time. Sure he wasn’t awful or anything but he was not good. At best a slightly above average playmaker. He makes good passes, but not great ones. He wasn’t finishing that well at the rim either. Defensively he did a good job staying in front of guys but had an issue fouling/reading offenses (I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt, very few guards are good on defense at 20). 

He played better at the end of last season than he did at the beginning of this one, mostly for the fact that 1) every team we were playing was either terrible, or decent teams with shitty defenses, and 2) our shooters were unbelievably hot during the last 16 games of the season. He looked absolutely terrible in the 3 games he played in the first round. Not “terrible but he’s a rookie terrible”. Like 15th man terrible. 

There’s a reason he got benched for TJ after 7 minutes against the fucking *suns* this year. He is just absolutely lost mentally. 

He still has a lot of potential to grow, and it’s obvious that he has a lot of natural ability. I’m glad he’s in Orlando where there isn’t as much pressure for him to get healthy immediately, but this idea that he’s some super polished player outside of his shot is dumb",nba
"1) To change the narrative that he's not a competitor. If he went to LA to directly challenge LeBron and spark a legitimate LA rivalry, it would be great for the NBA. 
2) He has a house there (I know a lot of players do who don't play in LA, but it's something)
3) A solid coach and a front office w/ Jerry West that's competent would be appealing to KD. They could attract more players to come there if he was there. 
4) Like LeBron, KD is trying to build a media company and LA would probably have more opportunities for that than in NY. ",nba

In the 2020-21 season they’re gonna get a healthy John Wall who’s a 20/8 guy and Beal who’s a really good player. Wall will be 30 and would still have a couple good years left, Beal would be 27 and at his best, and maybe they will draft a good player. Whereas the Timberwolves are going to be paying 2 guys 70+ million, one of them is Wiggins who’s showing that he’s a negative on the court. 

I’d rather be in the Wizards situation and bet that Wall can stay healthy when he returns than be in Minnesota’s situation and bet that Wiggins lives up to his contract.

"Ty Lue didn't seem to show a ton in the way of Xs and Os skills on offense, but he also had some very good iso/system defining players who constantly produced crazy high offensive ratings, so I think it's hard to fault him too hard for that. On defense, he didn't seem to be able to get buy in from players once he became a head coach, which I see as the biggest minus against him. He also played around with line ups a ton, which some people saw as a negative, but in the playoffs, he almost always put together good line ups that were adjusted to the teams they were playing. So, overall, I don't know that he's bad, but it was really easy for a narrative to form that placed all the negatives of his defense on hims and the positives of the offense on his players. 

The thing is that while coaches are better or worse at certain things, the vast majority of coaches are sort of replaceable. Not that many are bad enough to win or lose you that many games on the whole since they're normally hired with a decent pedigree and have a big support staff. ",nba

"ok if you think the hawks a better I really have to go as basic as possible here

say you have two teams, team A scores on 50% of their possessions playing at a high pace and team B scores on 50% of their possessions as well playing at a slower pace. 

Team A in one minute gets 6 shots up and scores 6 points in one minute. Every time they score the opponent gets the ball back, so in that minute they give their opponent 5 possessions and the opponent scores 100% of their shots scoring 10 points. Final score after a minute is Team A: 6 points vs Opponent 10 points.

Team B in one minute gets 4 shots up and scores 4 points in one minute. Hecause they play at a slower pace they give their opponent just 3 possessions and they score on 100% of their shots scoring 6 points. Final score Team B 4 points vs opponent 6 points

so in this scenario, Team A scored more points but was their offence as valuable since they gave up more possessions? they are down 4 points and team B is down 2 points. You could say its the defences fault for giving up more points but you can't blame the defensive side of the team for the fact the offence is rushing more shots. Its not like team B has a better defence or anything they both allowed their opponent to shoot 100%.

"You should trade him for cap space... whatever, keep taking L’s this is exactly what I mean. The majority of the NBA is clueless and thinks a team can win purely off skill. There’s a reason golden state became so dominant. They knew monte Ellis wasn’t much of team player and traded him, and used Steph curry as a core. Curry is an amazing scorer, but his passing ability is on another level. They built that team from the ground up, and got the best record ever with way less talent that other teams. KD luckily can pass, but the he isn’t up too par with the warriors chemistry. Luckily he’s one of the best in the league which can make up for that, but if he played like harden or Westbrook there’s no way the warriors would win. But keep being a delusional NBA fan, the media helps your narrative.",nba

76ers top 2 guys aren’t so scary against the raptors. Bucks will be put under the ultimately test this play offs.

"Kidd spent 5 seasons there vs 7 at Nets, 309 games for Suns, 506 for Nets. He had 5 All-Star selections there vs 3 in PHO, while having the same amount of All-NBA teams, only a 2nd one in NJ once instead. He led the Nets to two consecutive NBA Finals appearances though. And with all of his seasons around that time being so similar, you gotta go with longevity, along with the fact that he's very more likely to be a top 5 or even top 3 Nets player than Suns player. Nash was a bigger Sun than Kidd IMO, even though I love both of them as players equally.

Barkley was putting up similar numbers in 76ers and Suns, sure the finals and MVP are a great argument, though funnily enough you didn't mention the two finals for Kidd. Again, Barkley is more likely to be a higher ranked 76ers player than Suns player. He had his top 3 scoring seasons in Philly, and top 3 rebounding seasons in Philly. And with all of that said, I don't feel like putting Billy Cunningham, Red Kerr, or Steve Mix as 76ers PF/C as Suns already have Connie Hawkins there, who does deserve an all-time team spot.",nba
"Also, since he'll be eligible for a 35% max on any team he plays for in the summer of 2021 due to being a 10 year vet, odds are slim he'll just sign anything longer than a 2+1 this summer anyway, so that 5th year the Raptors can offer is almost certainly not a factor. Whether he stays in Toronto or goes somewhere else, he's probably gonna sign a 2+1 for the 30% max this summer, and then he'll opt out in two years and sign a 35% max that summer. 

The only difference salary-wise between signing in Toronto or somewhere else will be that his 30% salary will increase in the 2nd year of that deal 8% if he stays in Toronto versus increasing 5% if he signs somewhere else. Other than that 2020-21 season though, his money would be the same for every other year of his career moving forward. So basically his salary will break down like this:



Year | In Toronto | Anywhere else
---|---|----
2019-2020 | $32.7 million | $32.7 million
2020-2021 | $35.32 million | $34.34 million
2021-2022 | $42.35 million | $42.35 million
**Total** | $110.37 million | $109.39 million

**tl;dr** - the money won't be a factor for Kawhi in choosing Toronto over any other destination as he would only end up making less than $1 million more total over his career by staying a Raptor. BTW, this is a fact, not an opinion, so if it upsets you to learn that, I'm sorry to be the one to break it to you but I'm just speaking the truth.

Kareem [passing Wilt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K06R3Te4HAc) holds up better. Magic, Cooper, Worthy, McAdoo. He had another five All Star games, though.

If you’re one of 3 or 4 big market teams he’s willing to sign long term with, why mortgage your future a year in advance? Even if he gets traded to New York, unless you sign an extension on the spot, he can still walk and go to LA in 2020. Then you’re out a bunch of picks (not to mention Zion if you’re still saying he’s on the table), and AD walks away after a year. Just wait an extra year and get him in free agency, where you’ll end up anyway. 

This whole “trade for a guy on the last year of his contract” is too unpredictable. The Thunder got lucky PG stayed. There’s no guarantee Kawhi stays in Toronto even after the season they’ve had (and Toronto made the trade knowing this because they’re in win-now mode). ",nba

"Yeah it's one of those things ive had this convo in the past with others and i kinda come down on the opposite side

Him at the 3 IMO caused him to develop bad habits. I know Zach Lowe has said multiple times in the past there are people in the organization who have grown rather frustrated with Gordon's shot selection and him trying to do too much. Him at the 3 was them basically trying to make him Paul George and he's just not. 

a) Statistically he actually doesn't take a lot of his shots late in the clock(7 or less) which would be the type of shots you are forced to take because there's nothing else and nobody else could do anything. 

b) He's had one of the larger gaps in the NBA the past 4 years between his catch and shoot 3 pt % and his pull up 3 %. 35% on catch and shoot 3's. 25% on pull up 3s. Those pull up 3s are him very often just doing too much

c) This is the most damning stat with him. His FG% on drives and % of drives he passes. Compare it to the rest of the league and qualifers 

2017: FG %[110 out of 125 qualifier](https://on.nba.com/2GUCimC) Pass % on drives: 111th out of 125 

2018: Pass %: 120 out of 139 qualifers FG% on drives: 126 out of 139 [qualifiers](https://on.nba.com/2NEcbB1)

2019: Pass %: 81 out of 115 qualifiers FG%: 75th out of 115 

This is really bad. Aaron Gordon is a good finisher at the rim his athleticism is a big strength there's no excuse to be this bad on drives. It just highlights how many bad shots he takes. And you compound it with the really low pass% it shows he should be passing out of a lot of these drives. This year he's finally started to show a bit of progress but I would argue him trying to be a 3 only worsened these tendencies.

Orlando knows this they know this isn't optimal usage at all of him. But he just hasn't embraced a lesser offensive role where he focuses more on cutting, rolling to the rim and catch+ shoot 3s. I would argue he's always had better court vision than people assumed dating back to college also

Now for the Balcan countries and Italy you are probably right that they have a huge racism problem but its expectable considering black people have been an extremely small percentege of their population for the last 100 years so learning to live together with tgem and interracting with them on daily basis was extremely rare.

America had a huge black population living among them as (supposedly) free citizens with equal rights for idk almost 140 years and still is at the same spot racialy as balcan countries that only now due to enormous immigration numbers have to learn to live together with black people.

 Im from Greece and i admit it we are just as racist as Americans , maybe even more  but we never had more than 1-2 % of our population be black or generaly PoC until maybe very recently due to immigration so we never had to learn to live and coexist with other races and realize that shits is not so different .

There’s the negative effect of tiredness. But maybe you get tired whether you’re shooting a lot or not. And there’s positive effects of rhythm, practice etc. There’s the negative effects of greater defensive attention and likely worse shot selection if you shoot more.

Success is fantastic, but it doesn't last forever, and the development process and changes can be very interesting and entertaining. Also, a Zion wouldn't hurt.",nba

"&gt; future of contracts, rest time, and value.

By most estimates, contracts for elite superstars are already unfairly depressed. If you're paying Kevin Durant $40 million dollars when you should be paying him $80 million, it seems silly to haggle about him taking games off for the long-term benefit **of the team's success.**

That's another component -- it implies that teams should punish players for missing games by paying them less, when players are often missing games with the full support and encouragement of coaches, trainers and ownership. I mean, how did everyone seem to forget that Pop invented this?

Tim Duncan never played more than 75 games after he turned 32. Missing games *because your team wants you to* is not some indictment on leadership or work ethic.

Not to mention that there are still major incentives, especially for younger players, to qualify for the Rose Rule and the Supermax, and games missed factor in there too.

People seem to want to act like Kawhi is going to be the new norm, while ignoring thing like LeBron leading the league in minutes last season, or Harden taking on a crazy work load this season. Elite guys are generally elite because they have an insane level of competitiveness and drive.

"&gt;  they both had similar impacts on there championship teams.

I love Bosh but Pau was more important. The triangle system alone is great for role players to shine but it demands of your two stars to play at superstar level by carrying so much of the offensive load either by movement or conducting the ball (i've always wondered what the hockey assists % numbers would be in an actual triangle offense). And i know Bosh reinvented himself to play center but during Pau's first years ynum was constantly injured and he had to be the only big man most of the time because Odom, blessed his heart, was more of a forward in a big's body than a big. 

In 2009 he frustrated Howard and in 2010 he went to war against KG, Perkins and Wallace at times by himself. I know those are ""just"" two seven game series but he consistently did that because we didn't have much else

He also hyped Webber like crazy

"Because it still lends itself to players intentionally getting ejected. Let's say the coach takes a time out. He puts a big man on the floor who's like a 50% FT shooter, and the rest of the floor is 85+% shooters. Well if the big man gets ejected after a foul, the opposing coach is still screwed. A lot of last minute defense is trying to force the ball to the guy you want taking the foul shots. If that guy can just punch someone, get ejected, and have someone better take them than that's completely unfair. 

The rule rightly penalizes the team for a player getting ejected. ",nba

"Here’s my oooonly quibble: so many people said stuff like, ‘he leaves a team and they go in the gutter, he is the team and carries them.’ But the reality is that’s because of how the teams he is on that do well are built. When you build around Lebron and remove him, his game specifically is so integral to everything that it all falls apart. 

He, on his own, cannot just make a team win 50+ games. The team needs to be built a certain way. Which is fine and not even a knock on him. But it was an annoying myth people threw around about him. 

So those same people assumed adding him to a 35 win team+vets was gonna make a 60 win team. So it’s nice to have a real answer to that question, since this is also the first time he hasn’t had two stars added with him on his new team.",nba

"I CANNOT stand Lebron or the Lakers but it’s not like they weren’t in the mix before Lonzo’s injury. They had a pretty good defensive rating and were competitive. I think they actually were top 4 in the conference, at one point. I just hate that this narrative of wasting Lebron is getting pushed just so a narrative of “adversity” and “fighting back” for the next few seasons can reign supreme; especially if they get a top 4-5 seed with the same core. Maybe they don’t get Kawhi (I hope he stays in Toronto, but I think he’s going to LAC), but they were already a team with playoff potential this season, and (barring another major injury) will be playoff contenders next season, too. It’s just clown shoes levels of bullshit that the media is bent on setting up, what appears to be, a “feel good” story over the (probably) final 3 seasons of Lebron’s career so that it comes off as awe-inspiring if/when the Lakers make a Finals appearance over the course of his last contract.

I think AD will join him in LA (which hurts on all levels, as a UK fan and Lebron/Lakers dissenter), and he will win his fourth ring and call it a day. I don’t know the future but I can see the writing on the wall. The Warriors are close to the end of their insane historic run (especially if KD leaves), the Clippers look good but not great (if they do get Kawhi), the Celtics are who knows what before next season even begins, the Sixers will recede in wins from not being able to keep all the talent they have this season, the Bucks have a lot of money to pony-up over the next 1-2 seasons and may not be able to keep key players (i.e. Brogdon), the Rockets are already old with their 3 biggest playmakers, Toronto might not have Kawhi, etc. There aren’t too many teams that look ok (contracts-wise) during this period except for, maybe, Denver and Portland. All of this leads to Magic looking life a genius, Lebron getting a final ring, AD being the new face of the Lakers, and a new mediocre coach (because Luke will be unjustifiably fired) looking super smart over the next 3 years.

I’m sorry for the Bayless-level of ranting but this has been bugging me a lot, and I don’t think any of this is out-of-the-realm of the most likely scenario. Bookmark me or whatever and remind me over the next 3 years if this (Lebron at least making one last Finals) doesn’t happen.",nba

He was a phenomenal player, arguably the best center in the league at the time - I think Joel or Jokic def have a leg up on him now - but the question still remains the same, can he come back to what he was. And it's hard to tell, especially on a team with so much firepower, it kind of overshadows your weaknesses. Not to mention, there's still the question on his attitude. There weren't that many problems in NO  but who knows if he goes to another team and acts out again",nba

"you're gonna get snarky/meme-y answers but in each of their 6th seasons:

Giannis' adv stats (OWS, DWS, WS, BPM, and VORP) are all higher. If we look at raw splits: Giannis is 27.5/12.6 on 58.1% shooting, while Shaq was 28.3/11.4 on 58.4% shooting. I'd give the edge in that case to Shaq, the pace in today's game is higher so more possessions. Giannis' ORtg and DRtg are both better, but this is partially dependent on the other teammates on the floor IMO. Giannis obviously has more assists than Shaq by a fairly wide margin (6.0 vs. 2.4). 

Shaq was 1st team All-NBA, Giannis will be 1st team All-NBA this season. Shaq's Lakers got swept by the Jazz in the Conf Finals, it's TBD what Giannis does in the playoffs. Point being, the gap isn't super large if we consider each of their 6th seasons. ",nba

Regardless that xenophobia showed itself to be more about Islamophobia, specifically Muslim migration, I don't see the connection of any of that being relevant when talking about the deep-seeded American culture of institutionalized racism against black people. 

It isn't about a pro team not having the ability to issue a lifetime ban, as the Red Sox had proven 2 years ago, and Jazz would go on after this incident to affirm that power in the NBA (though unlike the Jazz, the Celtics ownership group doesn't own their arena). It's about whoever came to this decision not having the proper perspective needed to understand the nature of the conflict, the true severity of the transgression, nor the historical precedents set by similar incidents. Since the context of the entire incident is still unknown (who said it, who beyond Boogie heard it, what evidence exists of the incident, who ultimately decided upon the punishment, etc.), its entirely possible the people left in charge of this decision were unqualified, a group lacking any diversity, or held indoctrinated preconceived notions, prejudices, or biases towards black people or Boogie specifically. If we allow ourselves in the same manner to play the devil's advocate though, there's always a chance this incident could have been perpetuated by a minor or an elderly person suffering from senility. Maybe then 2 years makes more sense for someone so young or too old to ever return. Like mentioned above maybe it involves a very influential social or politically figure in the community who has the dastardly ability to force others to look the other way, or in the other direction, there simply was no corroborating evidence to sustain Boogie's claim, complicating the legality of invoking a harsher punishment. Maybe like with my NFL example, its a classic combination of a half-assed investigation mixed with an appalling lack of empathy, all of which is purposely meant to sweep the incident under the rug as quickly and quietly as possible. Until Haynes provides more insight, speculation is allowed to run wild, painting numerous scenarios in which the punishment varies from grossly incompetent to circumstantially understanding, with varying shades of gray in between.

The point is that institutionalized racism is so ingrained within our culture that it can be just as easily perpetuated by both an individual in an unconsciously unaware manner, as it can be an outright bigot. The former could have just made a poor, uninformed decision, while the latter could have just not cared enough the issue to make it any harsher. Given the story is still unfolding, assuming a lifetime ban should be the only outcome available in every possible scenario, without proper context, is as problematic as always expecting the world to be a fair and just place.

"Pels look like a .500 even without AD (and with trading Niko). Honestly, even with injuries, Pels could probably stay close enough to be able to snatch the 7th seed if AD was locked in. And then they had a pretty good chance of upsetting Nuggets with everyone healthy in playoffs. ",nba

"Robert Williams just needs to work his BBIQ. He's fast and athletic and has great defensive instincts. If he can learn to read plays better he will fit into the defense. Also setting better screens will help him on offense.

This holds no weight when you consider that Lebron has never had a major injury his entire career.

Except on offense where hes still throwing it down like hes 19.  You're correct though if your talking defense, he doesnt have the mental fortitude to consistently hustle on both ends.  ",nba

"We absolutely, 100% would have not only won the championship but swept LeBron in his first finals just like the Spurs did. We owned Lebron. He had no idea what to do with 7 seconds or less.   Especially at that stage of hos career. Would have been a massacre. The Suns Spurs series was the championship. If we werent so clearly jobbed it would have been a guarantee. Only way it wasnt a 100% guarantee is if Nash went down for the whole series and even then we probably still would have. You clearly have no concept of what the league was like in 2007.",nba

A lot of European immigrants dont have the same communities that central american and Caribbean immigrants do. And it is still an adjustment in learning the norms of white americans if youre an immigtant who is white. I have friends from Haiti that I think similarly found it hard to adjust to black american culture.

Teams have more power, that shouldn’t determine right and wrong. When the situation is reversed teams try to force their own work arounds. 

AD does have the right to ask for a trade, it’s makinv it public which he was fined for. Basically the NBA also says you can do this with little consequence with the small fine. ",nba

B) 4 in 19 years (if we include Ingram), is in fact super common since every year there's only one #2 pick. It's more than 20% of all the #2 picks.

"While the term “most segregated city” might technically be true I don’t think it’s a good descriptor of the the city from a cultural standpoint.  For example I grew up in Madison, a short drive from Milwaukee and found it just as segregated for different (and some of the same) reasons.  I rarely interacted with people from a different race, and distinctly remember in high school most people of a different race sticking to themselves.  Whether this is a product of age or not I can not tell you as I moved to Milwaukee for college.  Also like Milwaukee, most people of certain races lived in specific neighborhoods.  As soon as I moved to Milwaukee I started working and interacting with people of different races on a daily basis.  I’ve never felt any major tension or distance while interacting with someone of color.  The city has a lot of work to do to fix the zoning, education system, and many more issues that cause segregation, and I’m not trying to undermine these issues in any way.  That being said, I would say it does not affect my daily life in any stand-out way.",nba
"What statistics? Colin Kaepernick and his supporters have always seemed to me very open to statistics, many of their arguments are based in them. Some statistics were used to distract from or misrepresent the situation by ""all lives matter"" types though, like bringing up that more white people were shot than black people, which ignores the fact that there are a shit ton more white people in the country and the proportional difference shows greater violence towards black people. Other than that kind of thing ive never seen anyone about down statistics.

And is he doing it the best way? I don't know, no one knows. Does it matter? If we only allow protest in the forms the NFL and viewers deem acceptable, then there will be no protest at all. So people don't want to hear about how his protest isn't acceptable.

Again criticism of Hayward is not the same as criticism of Kap. One is about content, the other is (supposedly) about messaging. Very few people are saying Kap is wrong, they're hiding it behind ""keep politics out of sports"" and trying to silence his message rather than confront it. I don't want to keep politics out of sports. I'm glad we know Hayward is a Trumpee so we can call him out for it. I want his message silenced because it's a bad message, not just because it's politics.

Just because police are products of society doesn't mean I won't hold them accountable for their actions. Everyone loves that picture of the woman hitting the Nazi soldier with her bag as he walks by. I want that same sentiment toward cops.",nba
"you let their 4th and 5th guys beat you

let DMC/Draymond shoot. If they roll out a smaller lineup with more shooters (Steph, Klay, Cook, Jerebko, KD), you need less help in the paint and you still let Jerebko or Cook take their shots

While I think this could work against GSW, I also would expect Bud to tweak the plan in a 7 game series. But even if he doesn't, you really only need one guy open to send plenty of help to the rim",nba
"1. Think the Warriors still do fine if Dray leaves in the off season, obviously lose a spectacular defender and someone who is ability to handle the ball. Dubs would likely then have KD play his role on offense and I'm sure KD would flourish there. Think it's more likely the Warriors try and go for an under the radar interior defender in the off-season like a Dwight Howard type to try and alleviate for the loss of rim protection Dray can provide.
2. Not the scenario the Warriors would wanna see at all, but I think it's highly unlikely that both leave. I think the Warriors would fall maybe three or four spots in the standings if that was the case.",nba
"If Steph shot 90% unassisted 3s I think he'd be somewhere around 38-39%. He'd probably get more used to it as time went on (Harden looks weirded out when he gets a catch &amp; shoot these days lol) but he gets himself a lot of open looks through the movement and that of course helps the efficiency.

In the East you play more bad teams more often, therefore it's easier. There may be anomalies, but trying to parce these records is dumb. Who was playing? How seriously did the East teams take the Lakers maybe without LeBron?

How many of those EC victories came without LeBron?

So many things to take into account. If you know the West is better than it's hilarious you think Orlando trumps the Lakers in the East.

It hasn’t just been a couple games for Ingram. He’s the only one out there producing every night.  Zo is injury prone I will admit. But his intangibles on offense are definitely noticeable.

They would've had Kuzma anyway. They had 2 consecutive picks. They would've snatched him at 28.

David Robinson was nothing like Shaq.

I think he would have been amazing in today's P&amp;R league.",nba
We know what he means.  He's loyal to his profession and the people he cares about.  He's being a leader to an organization that needs one in the wake Paul Allen's death.  That isn't blind loyalty for the entire length of his career.  If he sees his best interests require a different  address I'm sure he'll make that decision.

"They did actually compete for the playoffs until the DSJ fiasco. And my entire point was his play after they traded all those players away, not before, which you totally ignored. Collins is a stud, and has been playing like it. Luka’s current team has none of that.

All I said was since the trade his numbers have been better than I expected and it is rarely acknowledged. ",nba
Jordan’s era also had strict defense rules where you couldnt leave your man unless you went for a hard double. The game was mostly played 1v1. It basically the same as what Harden plays today. It was much easier to break down defenses in the 80s. It was straight up easier to score.,nba
"On the contrary. Sterling moved the team from San Diego to LA in order to make more money.

Sterling ""lent"" his acquaintance, Dr. Jerry Buss money (Dr. Buss sold him real estate for relatively cheap) so he could buy the Lakers. After he saw how much money Buss was making with the Lakers, he formulated a plan to buy the San Diego Clippers and move them to LA as soon as he could.",nba
"I think that's the problem, he doesn't seem like he wants to that much. I remember specifically the game we played against the Pelicans this season in Miami, it was at least a month before the trade request and all the drama. 

AD started the game scorching hot. He scored like 20 in the first quarter and he had like 27 or something like that at the half and the Pelicans looked like they were gonna win the game. 

Then he didn't even disappear, because you could see him standing while on offense and him not doing anything while standing caught my attention. He wasn't asking for the ball, in fact after a while it seemed like he was avoiding the ball. He shot 3 times in the next 20+ minutes he was on the court and made all those shots, one (or maybe two) of them being three pointers. He tried to get into it a little in crunch time but not only was it too late, he still wasn't looking too focused.

At that point I was thinking this dude could've spanked us if he wanted to but he's clearly thinking about something else right now. We won the game. AD finished with 30ish points, 10+ boards, a bunch of assists, steals and blocks too. He was efficient too when you look at the box score. But the story of that game was so much more than the stats indicated. 

So I totally agree with what u/Dr_tuffednuts_MD is saying about stats. Even in a game that I consider as a terrible game for him, AD had amazing stats and there is no way you could see what I saw in that game from looking at the box score and not watching. ",nba

If you want an up-and-coming organization and want that California weather, head to the Clippers. From the top-down, they've become a respectable franchise.

You have someone who knows how to actually create competitve teams in Jerry West. You have an amazing coach in Doc Rivers - once he gave up his POBO position, his coaching improved significantly. He ran a team playing with G-leaguers to the 10th spot and was competing for a playoff spot for a big part of the season last year. He know is coaching a team to the playoffs this year without an All-Star. 

And most importantly, there are a bunch of solid, young pieces on the Clippers. SGA and Shamet have shown to be great young players. There's a grind/dog-like mentality with Beverley and Trez. You have a solid 3rd option on a title team in Gallo. You have 6 MOY in Lou Will.

"No it does not, but at the same time it is not abnormal or even unexpected for his decisions to be heavily frowned on.

You can't compare KD's work to an average Joe's work.  Average Joe's work doesn't have any significant impact and is easily replaceable.  If Average Joe left his company for a new job it would be similar to Jonas Jerebko joining the Warriors; no one really gives a shit (sorry Jonas).  KD leaving the Thunder for the Warriors is more along the lines of one of the top data scientists in the country making a big mistake, then joining a rival company that just beat out his company in part because of that mistake.  Not for better pay, not for a different role, but simply because his old company lost.

Even then, the analogy is not perfect because a star basketball player has far more impact on his team’s success than a top tier data scientist on his company’s success.

Again, KD has every right to do what he thinks is best for himself, and he's not an inherently bad person for the decision.  But it is completely reasonable for neutral fans to frown upon it, or to have a lower regard of his legacy.",nba

"If you sort by Total Jump Ball Win%, the top 11 are all small sample size guys with less than 50 attempts, then you have Sabonis at 72.7% (359 attempts), Shaq at 72.4% (1,125 attempts), Drummond at 72.2% (403 attempts). Then Giannis at 71.7% on 53 attempts, fwiw.

Shaq was a monster. Over 1000 attempts, still the 2nd best large sample size win%. Drummond is right behind him, if he has a good long career, he'll be right up there with him.

Duncan and KG ~~won~~ had more jump ball attempts than Shaq (1,202 and 1,131 respectively), but on only 62.2% and 54.4% win%.

edit: I was looking at total attempts, not wins. Shaq holds the record with 815 jump balls won. Duncan won 748, then Dwight has 693, Ben Wallace had 650, and KG had 615.

Drummond has won 291 of his 403. He's still just 25, in year 7. But he's actually only 35.7% of the way to Shaq's record. Not at all a given he breaks it.

Shaq also came into the league 5 years before this list started, so it's pretty remarkable just what a lead he has on the field. He probably won over 1000 in total.",nba

"This “you haven’t watched stuff” is lame. You can watch the Lakers, have been a Lakers fan before Lebron got there and still think he’s a good coach or at least think he’s been dealt a bad hand the whole time. He hasn’t mastered leaving one of his his more skilled creators in at all times  and has relied too much on Rondo playing big minutes while being a complete traffic cone. That stuff is annoying, but these rotation concerns are a league thing, not a Walton thing. The good coaches trot out zero creator lineups too. The offense is what I imagine a Lebron offense without shooters looks like. When you bring in Lebron with these dudes, this is what you get. The Lakers were unlikely to ever have a regular offense with James, it was always going to be his show a lot of the time. They have to run a ton with these guys, that is the right thing to do. 

Zubac has looked much worse in the past than he did this season. There’s a reason he wasn’t playing. Sometimes guys come out better, but Walton wasn’t at fault for not starting out trusting the kid. For all we knew, the Lakers came into this season without a trustworthy center. ",nba
"He usually storms off shaking his head and then occasionally pops off to the ref. I will say tho, for as many calls as Harden and Houston get, Tucker seems to get screwed a lot on defense. Plenty of times where he’s in perfect position and guys just bounce off of him because he’s so strong. ",nba
"Might be a bit weird, but I always liked him because he was so good in NBA Live 2004. His overall rating was in the fifties but he was a great 3p shooter. Whenever I started a new career mode I traded for him (usually 2nd rounder was enough) and started him at SG. All he could do was shoot 3s and that's all I needed from him. I always had him on my team and he always did really well. In future games I always traded for him or signed him from the waiver wire because he was a reliable 3 point shooter you could get easily. 

When he reemerged in the NBA with the Wizards it brought a lot of fond of playing him in that videogame and in other videogames and I was happy to see him have a nice comeback at such a late point in his career.",nba

"To give you an actual answer, he had a pretty good stretch of 5-6 games before the all star break but he has seemed pretty timid since the break.

"&gt; Nah, Kobe just got gifted the best all-star instead. You're kidding yourself if you don't attribute those first three rings primarily to Shaq.

It took both of them to win. Who do you think was leading the team against the gauntlet of Western conference playoff teams while Shaq dominated the against the East in the Finals with weaker frontcourts? 

&gt; And do you remember when Kobe demanded to be traded from the lakers when Shaq left?

Yeah, and unlike the Lebron stans constantly claiming Lebron has no help, Kobe actually had a horrible team and the Lakers management were sitting on their thumbs. You guys hold Kobe using his leverage as a star player as worse than Lebron actually leaving multiple teams high and dry. 

&gt; Hold on, can you sit back and imagine a Shaq and lebron duo in their primes? Would that be better than Shaq/Kobe? 

IMO they'd be worse. Lebron doesn't have the shooting ability to spread the floor like Kobe does and has never flourished in an actual system which just leads to his team playing 'Lebron ball.' He's not great at creating his own shots unless he's driving to the basket which just isn't going to happen as much with Shaq and other big men clogging up the lane. It's a cute thought though. ",nba

"Couple of things going on: 1. People with some R-less (non-rhotic) dialects tend to, confusingly, have what's called linking R where, while they don't normally pronounce the R at the end of a word like ""weather"", they DO pronounce it when it's followed by a vowel. So ""the weatha sucks"" but ""the weather-is nice"". Sometimes they also have what's called ""intrusive-R"", where the same thing happens but where there was no original R. So instead of ""Luke, Leia and Han"" an Aussie might say (to our ears) ""Luke, Layer-and Han"". Then there's also hypercorrection, where because people with non-rhotic dialects have been taught that it's bad or sloppy to ""drop Rs"", their brain tries to reinsert them when speaking formally, or trying to sound professional and mixes up which ""uh"" sounds are spelled with an ""R"". So it's not like they don't know how to spell China, but their brain interprets ""-a"", ""-ah"" and ""-er"" sound as being the same thing, basically.

The main issue is Wiggins can not under and circumstances eat up the cap space for 2021-22, 2022-23. KAT’s final season under contract in Minnesota is 2023-24 he will probably be fed up if they cant put together a at least 2 years of a very competitive team that makes a playoff run and is headed in the right direction.  If not there’s a very real chance they have an AD situation on their hands.

"That wasnt the point, that one guy said a lot of shit that was just false/wrong. Like that Luka is getting outclassed in all stats by Trae or simply giving wrong stats.

I just hate ciriclejerk and uninformed(even worse when people activly lie) reactions, its the same shit that made people call Trae a bust after 2-3 months because he sucked dick, the majority of the players start developing into star 2-4 years into the league and when I see shit like that I simply hate it. Because this isnt just about sport, these are the people that in todays age are basicly the cancer of society, its the reason problems(political) never get fixed but rather get shoved to the  side or blamed on something. Instead of informing yourself and making a judgement call on that they will rather, overreact and lie for their own benefit. I will gladly call out these people and that has nothing to do with Luka.

Here is the thing, an award isnt given for growth and the potentional of what a player could be in 2 years. Trae has looked better in march and there a some arguement(not strong ones) that he had a better january but at that point you have to value efficiency so much that it compensates ppg/rpg, steals, blocks and the fact that Trae is arguably the worst starting defender atm. Thats it, for all the other months there is basicly no arguement for him being better. But besides the basic stats there are also advanced stats that value Luka higher(every single one except AST%). And then there is his defense which from what I have seen(I dont watch a lot of Hawks or Mavs games, but occasionaly I watch some + from the stats) is garbage.

I have honestly no clue with these facts, how you could argue that someone deserves the ROTY award because he was better for 1(maybe 2) month. I have no clue where you get the idea from that Trae was better since the start of the new year, Luka basicly had his best month in february averaging insane stats at huge efficiency(57-58%TS).

I want one reasonable arguement why 1-2 months apparently are worth more then the entirity of the season because thats basicly how you are trying to argue Trae winning that award and thats just ridiculous.

Btw this is no knock at Trae he is amazing and looks like a future Superstar but at the end of the day I look at what players did over a whole season and not just 1 month and I dont consider what a player could be in 5 years in my judgement who would win that award.

Also its ridiculous that you want to try taking in huge speculation into your judgement of who is better. In generell players have good/bad months this doesnt mean that they wont improve or that they will keep getting worse, that how sports work. For all we know in 5 years Trae and Luka might be the worst or best NBA players ever, 1 month doesnt decide that(not even a whole month).",nba
"I strongly disagree then -- I think a degree of swag in all these players will make them go for the highlight reel ahead of the gamewinner, and specifically Gerald Green has a lot of these 'I'm on one, bought to destroy my man rn' type moments than Nick Young, who has consistently passed out of big shots in the last few years.",nba
"I agree. It's not the best commentary but what I do like about it is that the broadcast players are often brutal and honest about the current players. And they often have a different perspective about why a player is good or bad than the normal rhetoric you get from mainstream media. And also they're not scared to say anything.

Honestly play by play has been slowly devolving from calling the game to assisting the visuals. Compared to the broadcasting style of Chic Hern or Kevin Collaboro the Mike Breens of the current day are lousy. They can barely call who's shooting it much less describe the action seamlessly from baseline to baseline.

"&gt;So maybe the teams at the bottom of the NBA standings would really go for it in a tournament like this, but I find it hard to believe that teams like the Warriors, Bucks, Raptors, Nuggets, etc would even try a little bit.

For me that is actually part of the appeal of the competitions you listed above. They're just far more random because one game decides over whether you advance and in that game your opponent, who under regular circumstances might be considered to be much better, maybe just doesn't play as good as they could. So you will have a lot more underdog stories and that takes on a life of it's own. I just think the idea that your team can win a title even if they're not in the elite group of teams contending for the regular championship is something that might keep fans of all teams, but more specifically middle and lower level teams more engaged throughout the season. Having an elimination game every once in a while is something very refreshing as opposed to the 82 game regular season, which can get tiresome from time to time. It's adds more meaning to that ""Who watches the Hornets versus the Magic on a Thursday"" thing, because if it's an elimination game where they will actually be going at it, I'm tuning in. ",nba

"Oh... a poll on ESPN?  Right....  Appeal to the majority.  Ad hominems. Giving Kobe credit for team accomplishments?  Got it.  Makes sense. 

If you want to go down that route, just remember, LeBron has more championship without Shaq than Kobe does, he has more finals MVPs because didn't have to ride anybody's coat tails to a title. And he hit 8-straight NBA finals, and Kobe never took at team as bad as the 2018 Cavs, or the 2007 Cavs to the NBA finals.  Hell... prime Kobe couldn't even get the 2005 Lakers into the playoffs!  And LeBron's on pace to pass Kobe's career scoring number in 4 fewer seasons than it took Kobe to get there.

And you complain that LeBron is just chasing personal stats on the Lakers, but it seems like you dont' mind the fact that Kobe did 3 years of his career and use the Lakers rebuild as an excuse to throw himself a fairwell party while interfering with the development of the Lakers' young players.  

You clearly have Kobe-goggles on. 

Kobe is great. LeBron's great. I'll give them both praise... but you have such a hard-on for Kobe that you got to turn a conversation that has nothing to do with him into a debate about whether he's better than Kobe, while overlooking the fact that Kobe failed to get the Lakers in the playoffs with a comprable roster in his prime.

If he would have just waited to sign with the Knicks, instead of forcing a trade that depleted the Knicks roster, that team could have been competitive. 

To your point about nobody wanted him. Weren't the Bulls, Nuggets and Knicks willing to give him whatever he wanted for him to sign there? The Knicks even got a first rounder for trading him to OKC. Imo I feel like dude has been wanted.

"&gt; How often do top 10 NBA prospects graduate a year or two early from HS in order to go to college early and therefore get into the NBA earlier?

The thing is though at least for college, usually they're actually just reclassifying into the class they *should* have been in to begin with. A fair amount of athletes get held back a year somewhere early on so they can get the athletic advantage playing against younger/less developed players, and by the time they're in high school and can reclassify, they've done the summer work and are technically just rejoining the class they should have been in in the first place. A lot of times that's the plan all along.

Of course though you have some cases where they actually go reclassify a year earlier and end up extremely young, and that's how you end up with NBA rookies/sophomores that are younger than incoming draft prospects. ",nba

Second the Lakers were in a desperate hunt for a playoff spot before they lost to the Suns and it was one of the final nails in their coffin as far as playoff hopes went. The Bucks are still the first seed after losing to the Suns and will likely remain the first seed. It's clearly not as big a deal, can you actually not see that?

You're an idiot.",nba
I respect that. I just don’t like how some people want him to leave when we sucked for a long time and couldn’t get the top guys in FA. Then an all time great wanted to be apart of our franchise over every other franchise. In the middle of his prime too. Yet people are wishing he leaves. That just personally don’t sit right with me is all. ,nba
"Wrong.

Lebron does not have a no trade clause. NOLA can easily just trade him to another team like the Knicks or Clippers. He has 2 full years left on his contract.

AD wants to play with the Lakers. He really does not care if its with Lebron or not.  And the best thing is Kawhi/KD would love to join AD without Lebron around.

"Terrible comparison with Giannis. He's an elite defender, great leader, never causes drama, and is more impressive offensively despite not having a three point shot. His shooting is pretty much the only issue, and it's not even a glaring one. Lebron has multiple issues this season that are hurting the team. ",nba
"dude if u ever went out with a group of friends, and one of ur buddies uve known all ur life gets straight sucker punched, your fight or flight kicks in and these guys chose to fight. its not acceptable, but again if you've been in that situation, it's easier said than done doing nothing.",nba
"True but Giannis is really dominant offensively (he's going to smash the dunks in a season record) as well as being both an elite perimeter defender and rim protector. He's had one of the best two way seasons in a while, even though he's not as flashy. It'll be close.

It parallels the WB-Harden race a few years back, but now Harden is the one with the crazy statistical season.

Age might be a factor tbh. Voters will think Giannis is going to have a bunch of chances down the road and give him a make up MVP later on and give it to Harden now.",nba
"It’s not ALL about the length of the contract that a player signs and if it’s during their prime years, it’s about what the player achieves for the team during their contract too.

"Again, Curry shooting percentage creates more space for his team than anything Harden does.  He is the best off ball player ever and the best shooter ever.  That helps a team out more than just hitting free throws.  Curry’s gravity&gt;Harden getting 5 or 6 foul calls a game.  It’s not even close.


Let’s also not forget that Curry is more efficient than Harden.  It’s a proven fact that Curry makes his teammates better than anyone else in the NBA.  And how can you say that Harden creates more PPP when his TS% is lower than Curry's?  Legit everything you just wrote is factually wrong lol.",nba

"You mean the Devin Booker whose considered an elite shooter but shoots less than 33% from 3? 

LaVine is ahead of Booker because in 1 year, his first year as the lead guy on a team he has shown he can contribute more to winning than Devin has in 4 years. He can match Booker's scoring output, at same or better efficiency and be more involved defensively. 

Lou Will is ahead of Booker for similar reasons. He has been the go to scorer in LAC for a while on a team thats not very talented and done much better than booker. say all you want about coaching difference, it doesn't make in the gap between the two and their wins.

Brogdon is ahead because he is extremly efficient and has raised his volume enough to where he is a 16 PPG guy in LESS than 30 minutes. Compare the per 36 numbers with him and booker since booker has a huge MPG advantage stats are not far off.

"You ought to change your flair man. The only people falling for that Heat flair are your middle school classmates. Anyways, since you're so bent on using TS% as a measure of offensive capability, I take that you think Giannis is better offensively than Curry? After all, it clearly doesn't matter that the Bucks system allows for Giannis to get high efficiency shots when Curry or Harden often have to take improbable shots. And CP3 shooting 7/18 definitely didn't help us lol, nor would Capela shooting more (he was feeding off harden). What would Capela do if he was passed the ball with 3 seconds left on the shot clock? I'd much rather have harden taking that shot even if it means he misses it.",nba
"Play Jrue despite the risk of being injured - still helps him grow with the other players. And helps grow with the organization itself since he’s clearly in the our plans for the future. 

Play Davis - gone in a few months, wants no part of the future. Takes minutes away from people who could benefit our future.

Davis is literally only a trade asset at this point since he has no plan for the future of the pelicans. Letting Jrue grow with the team will have a positive effect on the future of the pelicans. 

What you’re asking would make sense if they were resting him for better lottery odds. They’re resting him to save a trade asset, which is all he is. They would rest Jrue for lottery odds, IF they were tanking. Basically, if Davis was being rested for better draft position, Jrue would be too. But that’s not why Davis is being rested.

"Possibly an unpopular one but, Steph Curry's injuries in the 2016 playoffs. Had he been playing at full strength against the Cav's and performed as he did in the regular season his and LeBron's legacy would be drastically different. 

Curry's season would be in conversation for one of the greatest of all time had he won finals MVP and I believe he would've been considered the best player in the league over LeBron rather than his perpetual ""top five player"" consideration since the finals loss.

LeBron likely would have a much weaker argument for GOAT without the greatest achievement of his career. 

Further, KD would not have ended up on GS and the current Warriors super team with him doesn't happen.",nba

Insinuating that because someone else calls you boy when you are not black makes it non-problematic  when white people call black people “boy” collapses the racial history and contemporary unequal social relations present between white people and black people.

"&gt; There are a lot of middle class homes around that area that have long been priced out of Lakers games.

This has already been the case for decades though and it hasn't made a difference. The Clippers whole strategy of attracting people to see their games live is literally that they're a much cheaper alternative than the Lakers are, but that hasn't won over any fans. Look at like, say, Bill Simmons for instance. The guy is a die hard Celtics fan who's had Clipper season tickets for like 15 years, and yet he's still a die hard Celtics fan. 

Most people in LA are already a fan of an NBA team, whether it's the Lakers or (if they're transplants or their parents were) then it's some other team from around the country. Simply getting cheap tickets to Clipper games doesn't make someone a fan of them. You need people who aren't already fans of some other team to start rooting for the Clippers, and the only way you establish that is with some kind of legit sustained success. And I don't mean just making the playoffs and then losing in the 1st or second round, I mean winning titles and being in championship contention.

But even if that happens in the next couple years, it's not like that'll suddenly flip Laker fans into being Clipper fans. It might establish new fans, but that'll take a long time to really grow into something meaningful and sizeable. I mean, how many people in LA are basketball neutral and are looking for a team to support? There can't be very many, probably mostly young kids. You have to appeal to them and then let them grow up as fans of yours. It takes a lot of time to do that.",nba

I’ll say 8.  Most of the top 7 seems like teams that are trying to take swings for stars. I think a team like Washington wants to build around Beal and maybe adding 3 role player type guys that could be available a littler later would be a way to do that in a hurry. ,nba

"His 34% season is the only reason he’s not a 28% career 3 point shooter. Like. Same with his 45.7 and 45.1% FG seasons. Without those he’d probably be a 41-28-82 guy. That is so shitty it isn’t funny. 

I remember in his MVP year. I watched him score a 30 point triple double but on like 20% shooting and was like “nah he’s fine” but then I started realising. Like. Every second game was 10 3 point attempts with 1 or 2 makes, 25 shots with 7 or 8 makes, 6 or more turn overs and bad shots. And it’s just been this way since. 

This year he is making some of his best decisions he’s ever made, when initiating the offence, but his scoring still remains pathetic. And that’s not good. For a guy who scores 22 a night for his career.... that’s a lot of missed shots. 

I think it stems from being shit In high school.  Then being a beast senior year, and pretty damn good at UCLA  and not needing a jumper because of the athletic spurt, where he could just bury layups over guys. All of a sudden he started playing NBA defenses after all this. Matched up on people stronger than the high school / college bodies, but he just kept taking those same shots he always has.

"Can I offer something? 

Personally, I'm a white guy who grew up in predominantly black schools for much of my youth. But in my adulthood I've seen how a lot of white people are around black people, and I think there's a lot of instances where they just don't know how to act. For instance, the guy behind the register, he may be intimidated, maybe you guys looked ""cool"" to him, maybe he asked himself, ""what's the appropriate way to greet these guys, the head nod?"" Or maybe he wanted to greet you guys but also thought to himself, ""what if they think I'm talking to them because I'm suspicious of them, so maybe I'll just respect their space."" Maybe he stopped him self from greeting you guys like he greets other white people (Howdy!) because he was afraid you guys would think he's a corny-ass white boy (if you're white and you grew up a lot of black people you've probably been called this). And maybe he's just plain racist. But I'm guessing that he has much more experience with those types of white girls and their parents, because that's what he grew up around, so he feels comfortable talking to them. I know when I came into adulthood, having grown up around lower-income people myself, I felt awkward around affluent people, like I didn't really belong there, or at a friend's frat-ish party with a bunch of privileged white kids I felt super uncomfortable and wouldn't necessarily engage. 

I hope this doesn't come off as me downplaying racism, because it's obviously still around, and I know it doesn't take someone dropping an N-bomb to be racist. But for the majority of white people I know, I think it's more along the lines of not knowing how to communicate, and then being scared into inaction. And if you're given the opportunity to strike up a conversation with these white people, perhaps that's a big step toward them feeling more at ease and less of a barrier between themselves and you. I think Jordan Peele got it right with Get Out. He showed white people being so enamored with black people/culture that they wanted to BE them. I know I wanted to jam like Shawn Kemp, not shoot a midrange jumper like Detlef Schrempf. When you see white people listening to hip hop in the car, or talking about how sexy Kyle Lowry's ass is, or back in my day it was dressing in FUBU (not me...cringe), it's just people appreciating the culture and in ways wanting to emulate it. I think these people want to be accepted by black people much the way everyone wants to be accepted. 

I'm not trying to say it's on you or any other black person to bridge the gap, because it's not. But I am trying to offer up another narrative/perspective for thought: there could be other reasons this guy, and others, treats you differently. Thanks for listening. ",nba

'I can't evaluate [Lillard and McCollum] off of that series' .... ""You got to be looking at those last few games and going, 'Yo, if we had some snipers out there, I'd have got off.""

Usually teams should get crushed for doing that, but we ran almost everything out of Dame high pick and rolls and we had literally no shooters to make them pay for it.  They left CJ who shot well but he can't run an offense at all and they had Jrue and Ad who are both monsters

I disagree with that sentiment, there was a marked difference between the teams in terms of physicality. The Celtics are not a very physical team on offense (hence why they always draw so many free throws) and Philly was more physical than usual last night.

"Kyrie did it for 2 seasons before asking to be traded. He also wasn't a back2back MVP.

Unselfishness and chemistry mean a lot both on and off the court, and it's why Curry has been easily their most important player (even if KD is likely their best player). They've looked terrible in games that Curry misses, and that team will always be Curry's team with how much he drives the style and play in their performances.

"&gt;Yeah that’s irrelevant to players who can easily create their own shot. You can guard him full court if you want to, the dude is still gonna put up 13 threes.

Players would get pushed down for shooting a few threes in a row. They'd get unfairly fouled with no call. Mark Price was great at creating his own shot.

&gt;Great post defenders exist, that’s why nobody posts up anymore. It’s too inefficient to do so.

I'm not talking about banging down low. I'm not talking about what Boogie does. I'm talking about finessing players in the post. Ayton seems damn near unguardable against certain teams because he'll feast with his moveset all game. His stats would be higher with a competent point guard. Yes, being Ayton isn't as efficient as being a player like Capela, but that's because it's a form of creating your own shot. Players don't post up because it's easier to shoot threes and get to the basket. That's reasonable. That's more efficient and it's just how the game is played. However, Hakeem would still be damn near unguardable. 

&gt;The pace is faster, but as a reason players also play fewer minutes. Possessions per game remain roughly the same between the eras (75 per game)

Yeah, you're right.

&gt;You cant really adapt to the future. Like if a player from 20 years into the future came into the league, it would take years and years to adapt to defend him.

If that's true, then players wouldn't be able to adapt to Hakeem today.

&gt;Handchecking has been illegal since the 70s. But lets say youre right. 80s/90s defenses would have to hard double Harden or let him play 1v1. Considering his scoring AND passing ability (unprecedented at the time) he would break the game. Youre sending one of the best iso players of all time back to the iso-ball era...

""Following the 2003-2004 season, you see, the NBA banned hand-checking of perimeter players. The league hoped that cracking down on pushing and grabbing would give the game's offensive stars more space to roam, increase scoring, and create a more fan-friendly, aesthetically pleasing game""

That's what I'm talking about. James Harden would be special for his perimeter play. That's why I said he'd average 30. However, his passing wasn't unprecedented. This game has always had great playmakers.

&gt;That’s true. But youre basically claiming that the game is more difficult now because there’s more good players.

The gather step didn't exist before the 2000s. Carrying and travelling rules were more strict. The type of ball handling that Durant does, for example, would get called for a carry every other possession back then. Offensive players have gotten more freedom. This makes players obviously better at scoring. Defensive players have gotten less freedom. You can point out zone defense, but that would just make it even. There's also the fact that players have better nutrition, training, shoes, supplements, and medical care. Harden wouldn't have as much freedom handling the ball now back then.

"I don't know. I mean, Ball has been injured repeatedly throughout his short career, right? IIRC, there were issues summer league his first year, significant missed time his rookie year, issues this past summer, etc. Maybe Lebron wasn't expecting him to be injured, but he probably shouldn't have counted on him to be healthy. 

LeBron missed time, but guy is has almost as many total minutes on his body as Tim Duncan did for his career. Duncan's literal nickname was ""old man river"" for fuck's sake. 

Again, maybe James wasn't expecting injuries but counting on continued good health seems like wishful thinking.

Besides that, what other injuries can you point to that put them in this position? Kuzma, Josh Hart, KCP, Lance, and JaVale are all at \~90% or more of games played. Before the recent injury, Ingram was also at about 90% minus the 4 game fighting suspension he had. Obviously, he is done for the season now, but Lakers playoff odds were already pretty much done before he went down 3-4 games ago.

So yeah. Ball continued his history of injuries that we've seen his entire, albeit short, career. LeBron starting to show some of the signs with one of the highest minutes counts in NBA history. Other than that, most other major guys are around 90%+ games played.

Luke has an *impossible* position.  We all know he can't really win with the rosters of the last few years -- except when Lebron started.  Instead of the Lakers hiring some expensive HC, we took a gamble on a younger assistant -- with virtually no downside.  

If Luke can somehow get whatever roster in place into a position to win, GREAT.  

If Luke can't get the guys to gel, the Lakers aren't out a lot of money, and the blame can more easily land on his watch.

The real meat of this all: our roster was lousy, outside of Lebron.  Holding onto cap flexibility is helpful, but no one (UFA) really wanted to be a Laker enough to give up those extra dollars.  So now the Lakers are stuck with players that want short term deals (not many), and there isn't enough talent to get enough Ws to keep them in contention.

Nearly very metric suggests that the 2012-2013 Lakers had more players providing value than the current Lakers. I can cite RPM, RAPM, PIPM, any metric you want. That Lakers team was more efficient with guys like MWP, Dwight Howard, Jodie Meeks on the floor than the current Lakers team is with Ingram, Lonzo, or whoever else you want to prop up.

The Lakers were playing well pre ASB because Lebron was playing. Ingram had a negative net-rating for most of the season, Lonzo's offensive numbers have been putrid all season-- he's essentially a one way player at this point despite his passing (though he's still a massive upgrade over Rondo which highlights just how poorly constructed the Lakers are), Tyson was not playing well pre ASB lmao wtf are you talking about? He was barely able to play spot minutes because of how terrible he was offensively and slow-footed he is defensively. Kuzma was inconsistent and Zubac came alive in late December but he still wasn't this panacea that you're making him out to be. Javale's play cratered and he was never great on defense.

&gt; **I’m going to ask you this question, and I know people will interpret it as a free agent question, but with your skills and what you’ve accomplished, do you feel the need to “build something” somewhere else? Do you need that for yourself?**

&gt; I don’t need anything in this basketball world to fulfill anything in me. The NBA is never going to fulfill me. It’s going to make me feel good about all of the work that I’ve put in, but I think those days of me wanting to prove something to anybody or walk around with a huge chip on my shoulder is not my thing.

&gt; I don’t feel like I need anything like that to prove who I am. I’ve been in it for too long.

In other words not fully sold his jumper has actually fully made the leap yet. The thing with him is he's gotta first be fully confident in his 3 because his general shot profile is not the most favorable for a guard's efficiency.

What I can report is, the healing process did take about 7 months for me to feel sturdy on the ankle and obviously he’s going to be thru way more rigorous physical therapy than I had, initially mentally I did feel less confident making certain cuts due to fear that my ankle would snap again but I quickly was able to resume playing at the same level I had before. The only thing for me is occasionally I do feel my ankle getting tight and jumping and cutting occasionally make it feel awkward but I’m sitting at over a full year after my injury and I don’t find it halting my athleticism at all.

But you'd still have to factor in the AD chase and subsequent loss in morale, which i still think would have happened. 

On court:

\-Harris and Gallo are a better, more experienced version of Kuzma and Lebron, BUT, as with the lakers, the clippers would have the problem of 3 players playing 2 positions.

"SAS was very well suited to exploiting Miami's trapping scheme, but they struggled more in every other playoff series, including a 7-game first round. They weren't bulletproof in general, but yeah that series was just vicious.

I don't think the issue is the loss, so much as how it happened. LeBron was in the hottest shooting zone of his entire career, on the receiving end of what was then the biggest blowout in Finals history (point differential), and yet he was going full quarters without even getting a shot off. Kawhi and Green were punishing the hell out of him on D as well.

The main thing that stuck out to me was just how it ended:

 I've posted it a few times before and can't find the link on youtube currently, but LeBron ended that series by bricking a jumper, taking a full ~15 seconds to walk back on defense, then taking a literal non-exaggerated 20 seconds to get back on offense, never so much as leaving the 3pt line as the Heat ran back on D, eventually got the ball fed up to him for an uncontested three, which he bricked. He then checked himself out of the game, while Wade and Bosh remained in the game for something like 10 real-life minutes longer. Everyone knew he was leaving, just like in 2010 against Boston and just like the second half of Game 4 against Golden State last year. ",nba

"People keep saying that, but the fact of the matter is that when Kanter was with the team this season, every game they won, he played in, and the lost every game he didn't play in, and the team had a better record in games where he played 20+ minutes than games where he played &gt;20 minutes.  

I assume from your use of the word 'us' that you are a Knicks fan, so I understand why you might be of a different mind, but Kanter stands as an example of where a player who makes the team better is pulled off the court for no apparent reason. 

If that reason is player development... ok.  I can get behind that, but from the outside looking in, it seems pretty clear the Knicks management (not the players) see this season as a wash and are more interested in getting a high lottery pick than 'player development'.  But one can't say for sure. 

There is a reason that Kanter is a regular rotation player on a playoff team in the West (they are 7-3 since his arrival \[a .700 winning percentage vs. a &gt;.600 before he got there\] and he has not received a single DNP;CD): he has limits, but he can contribute.

&gt; I just don't see how a Durant who is significantly worse than Lebron in running an offense would be able to conjure up 16 to 20 wins out of thin air while missing almost a quarter of the season.

The Lakers did not need any more playmakers. They needed shooters and shot creators. KD is not just good but super-elite on both, but his ability to create his own shot is matched only by Harden.

 He is the best scorer in the league, and he is MILES better defensively (yes, defense is too, a part of basketball) than lazy-ass Lebron. With KD the Lakers, already good defensively, become a lockdown defensive team, and with his scoring output, will be able to make the playoffs.

That's why I'm telling you that mentioning that 6% is totally misleading - there's no denying there are racists in Greece but tell me something, what's the only country in the western world right now with a radical left government? That's right, it's Greece. Why? Because Greeks are anarchists or communists and definitely not racists? Not really. It's the financial crisis, again, that made that happen. There are racists everywhere.

Hmmm this needs a lot more nuance. Obviously the % of SYRIZA during these years became what it is because of the crisis (and the complete disintegration of PASOK party). But you, by presenting SYRIZA as a radical far left insurgency group, become a 'bit' disingenuous. Just a bit.. 

The party didn't become a government by promising to overthrow capitalism worldwide. They promised an alternative approach. Whatever the angle one has, they did nt succeed.  At this point, especially after left wing elements leaving the party altogether since 2015, this party can be characterized as a center/ center-left party. Do I need to mention the content of the numerous memorandums voted by this party ? Can anyone in their right mind judge this government as pro labour or anything close to that ? But you obviously know this. Especially if you re a worker in greece. 

Racists do exists in every party. What is called as casual racism. It s a serious issue by itself. But that still doesn't excuse someone voting for the abomination that is the Golden Dawn. Again, you don t just start doing the nazi salute one day or actually proceeding to kill an immigrant just because he s an immigrant. Or start waving swastika flags left and right. Come on now.

"It's tough to explain. Basically receivers are super important. yes. However, for a receiver to get the ball thrown to him, a lot has to happen: the line has to give the QB time and the QB needs to make the throw. So teams tend to invest in the first line of 'what needs to happen', which is 1) protecting the QB and 2) the QB getting the ball to the WR. Once those two things are established, the rest of the players are important but replaceable. 

To illustrate this further, any running back can thrive behind a dominant Oline since they will have a lot of room to work with. Same with Quarterbacks, they can look better than they are with a good line. 

This also applies to receivers now if we go one step further: a good QB can make a receiver look better than they are with ball placement and whatnot. This isn't always the case, and receivers still need to get separation to catch the ball. At the end of the day investing a lot of money in receivers is risky because if the quarterback is bad or if the quarterback doesn' have time to throw, then the receiver has less influence in the game since the ball might never get to him. 

TL:DR: Receivers are important but there are more important things to focus on on offense, specifically offensive line and QB. Without either of those two, the receivers will have a harder time catching passes. Their production depends on the line and QB doing their job, while the reverse is not necessarily true",nba

For other sports, I would say that Memphians are fans of the St. Louis Cardinals and Nashville Predators the most.

The controversy is fueled by the claim that a man named Arsen Ilyasov, born in 1984 in Bukhara, Uzbekistan, entered Turkey as an 18-year-old in August 7, 2002 and was never heard from again, while on September 19, 2002, a man named Semsettin Bulut claimed to have forgotten to register the birth of his now 15-year-old son, and did so as Ersan İlyasova, a Turkish citizen. This claim, that İlyasova is actually Ilyasov and should be an Uzbek player, was officially put forth by the Uzbekistan Basketball Federation in a grievance, but FIBA ruled in the Turkish Basketball Federation's favor. While this controversy was brewing, some media outlets, such as ESPN's Chad Ford, openly referred to Ilyasova as ""The 17-year-old forward from Uzbekistan is widely considered the best prospect to ever come out of Turkey."" Other biographies, while not claiming an Uzbek birth, still maintain a 1984 birth year.

"In my opinion you can't say that for sure, because FIBA was quite content with letting Euroleague run things for over 15 years.

Maybe a competition like the champions league of UEFA would have been better, but you can't expect things to change over night. Especially since the wealthiest and most popular teams have said closed contracts with Euroleague

FIBA seemed to be under the impression that they could destroy the Euroleague in one day, and so far they failed to lure even a single powerhouse team away from Euroleague and to the Basketball Champions League.

Also, let's not pretend like the FIBA competition is perfect. Their competition system is unnecessarily complex and uses format that are outdated ( like home and away games decided on point differential instead of playoff series )


All I am trying to say it's that it's not black and white. I don't know what the best solution will be for European basketball but for sure we can't dissolve the Euroleague and expect everything to be fine.

"I mean that is the literal definition of racism (prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior).

As to your points about the left, yes and no. It is subtly based on racist ideals to promote democracy in other places, but not at the same level of paternalism nor does it directly stem from colonial expeditions that were to promote Christianity to the ""savages who needed to learn"" which inform missions. Robert Lupton wrote a good book on the ineffectiveness of missions and their history. However, you make a good point that more people need to realize - much of our world is subtly racist/prejudiced, even on the left of US politics. And yes, that would also be racist of Mormons - racism is very complicated and also heavily connected to religion (basically all of them).

There are ways to do missions that aren't racist, but those require much more planning, insight and are not that common. Missions should about learning about the culture, being in a partnership and listening and understanding. Often they are paternalistic and heroic, and that is definitely based off of racism.",nba

Nothing about his scoring going up while Wall is out is surprising, and it would be a lot more impressive if he could somehow get them some wins.

Dame is an average defender, as is Simmons. People **always** hype up the defense of guys who can't shoot. Idk why it's a thing, but it is. The worse you shoot the better people think you can defend cause obviously you must be doing something positive right? No. He's not that level of a defender.

I’m not saying Booker is like Carmelo prime wise, but it’s unfair to compare Booker’s team success to Melo because Melo at this point of Booker’s career definitely got more help than Booker, since Booker has really had Ayton, Bledsoe and Warren as his best teammates in his tenure, who are good, but not as good as the help and coaching Anthony got. Carmelo was the definitely the main player but he also had great help for those nuggets teams.",nba
Curry much like most non rockets fans knows Harden is more than good enough without the acting.  I have a feeling a lot of players around the league don't like Harden's style of play because of that.  Marcus Smart flops because he isn't that good without it but Harden without flopping would still average 25 plus easy.  Curry also basically never gets calls because he plays through contract without flopping.,nba

They traded or let go a ton of draft capital to end up with Mike Muscala and the possibility of getting Kawhi or Klay this summer.

Lebron has only won championships when his team has at least 3 All Nba level players, tons of shooting, and a top2 payroll.  At that point almost any MVP level player is going to win titles. ",nba
"No the difference between a minstrel play and Robert Downey Jr. is how the context affects the viewer, not the intent of the minstrel vs. the intent of Downey.  I don't care if someone's trying to make a commentary on idiots who wear blackface.  I care if someone makes that effort clear enough that the viewer can tell.  If Downey Jr. just wore blackface as a joke or a commentary, people would see that as mocking and therefore racist.  Here, the intent was the same, but the execution was such that it was unlikely to be seen as mocking.  Racism is about effect on the listener, not the speaker's intent.

If racism was based on intent, there would be no such thing as unconscious racism, which is the primary type of racism discussed in modern business settings.",nba

"I’m getting pretty tired of all the blame being levelled at Kyrie and morons like Bill Simmons wishing he gets injured. Kyrie has had his best season to date and earlier was in the MVP convo (if remotely). 

The problem has been expecting too much from young players who’ve done nothing of longevity in the league and who have a pretty big ego from getting to the ECF. The problem has been Stevens unable to manage those egos. The problem has been Horford being subpar. The problem has been Hayward being awful.

Kyrie isn’t a great leader and he’s definitely said some dumb shit but it’s bullshit to say he’s the biggest problem there. ",nba
"I agree that harden is having a phenomenal season. I just think that since Giannis doesn't control the ball as often he is still not getting his due. How many people had the Bucks placed at the top seed of the Eastern conference with their roster. And last but not least, Giannis is a monster on the defensive end as well. I honestly think a lot of people are obsessed with stats and fail to look at the whole picture. It's unfair to disregard Giannis' accomplishments this season over Hardens scoring heroics based on player usage. Look at the year Kobe averaged 35, granted his seed wasn't as high as the Rockets but his team was ten time worse and made the playoffs. Scoring should only be glorified if it actually correlates to the top seed or second seed in my opinion, there's so much more to the game than that, in my humble opinion.

"&gt;Since 1990, the Detroit Pistons are the only team to win the championship without an MVP

Techincally right, but it's not what it looks like. 

 - 2014: Spurs have 0 MVP level players.
 - 2011: Dirk is arguably a top 5 player, but nowhere near the best in the world/ MVP level.
 - 2008 Celtics had post-prime KG (still a superstar, but not MVP level). 
 - 2007: Arguable that Duncan is still an MVP player, but he's 4 years removed from his MVP.
 - 2006: Wade never won MVP. Counting Shaqs here is just..idk
 - 2004: No MVPs in the roster.

&gt;Steve Nash is the only non-lottery talent to win MVP in NBA history

 - Kawhi finished 2nd in 2015 and 3rd in 2016 (picked 15th)

 - Giannis is gonna win this year (picked 15th)



&gt;Almost always top 3 seeded teams win the finals

Better teams win more often! Better shooters make more shots! Thanks!!!

&gt;A center hasn't won an MVP since 2004

Giannis plays 25% of his minutes at the center position. Embiid and Jokic are both gonna finish top 10 in MVP. Not exactly sure what's your point.

&gt;A team with 2 prime MVP's has never not won an NBA championship

Which teams have had 2 MVPs in their prime in the first place? Cause the Lakers lost in Kobes/ Shaq prime, but Kobe did not win MVP until a few years after.

Dr. J and Moses were not on their prime in Philly, even though Julius got a lifetime award MVP for no apparent reason. Barkley and co were washed up.

Essentially, the sweet spot is 4 WAR players.   One 4 WAR player is worth more than two 2 WAR players, but two 4 WAR players are worth more than one 8 WAR player.  

The reason is that there are tons of 2 WAR guys, so it's a benefit to free up the roster/lineup spot by having one 4 WAR guy.  In contrast, there aren't nearly enough 4 WAR players, so if you spend enough to get an 8 WAR guy, it means that you're going to have a hole elsewhere in the lineup.

Furthermore, Murray and Barton have been very inconsistent and their insertion has led to players somehow fighting more to ensure their shots off - which has led to some selfish plays and poor shot selection.

The team has a ton of potential, but a lot of work to do before they can be considered contenders. I think they should try to get an athletic PF and a solid PG who can defend in the offseason.

He's scoring 15+ points a game with zero plays run for him.  His screen and roll gravity is incredible.  He's making passes and right now he IS the offense.  It all runs around how he changes the floor.

Free throw percentage is a laughable critique in the first place but he's hit over 80% in the clutch and is nearing 70% on the season, not even BAD now.

"Yep Chris Paul in 2017 had the highest net on/off court differential in the NBA like +20.2 it was historically high. They literally went 30-15 with DeAndre, JJ, CP and Paul Pierce's corpse it was absurd how they would just not miss a beat without Blake. He camouflaged a lot of weaknesses and shitty roster management for yrs. This is pure hindsight but had they traded Blake Griffin around 2015 it likely would have helped that team a fair bit. 

Ultimately they are an ex of how hard it is to win a title in the NBA. Look at the talent they lost to in 2014 vs OKC in a series that could have gone either way it's hard to say that was a failure its just the way they lost that killed them. 2015 their issue was they never took defense seriously all year but even then it's hard to argue through 3 quarters of game 6 vs Hou up to that pt they hadn't been impressive in the playoffs till then. 

But like you said earlier GSW raised the bar for what a title contender is to ridiculous standards from 2015-17 it was an unusual time in the NBA. Had the Lob City Clippers best teams come in say 2010-12 it might have been a different story had they gotten a few breaks. 

It's also impossible not to talk about how they didn't love playing with each other when looking at this roster in hindsight. Everything was so delicate. That 2017 season was the perfect ex start out 14-2 and they get smacked vs GSW and basically never recover. Even after they got healthy in Feb they just couldn't get back to how they were playing earlier if one little thing derailed them that was it. ",nba

His judicial style was markedly different in this way, and to pretend otherwise is foolish. He said it himself many times.

I didn't say he was a shitty judge (not by the standards of ""upholding the law"" anyway), I said he had shitty views and was a piece of shit. 

I don't care if the supply for racism is going down. As I said it was going down after the civil war, but great efforts were still undertaken to make sure it went down faster. Was that not pragmatic? Should they have just let it slowly decrease over time? Why is my desire to see racism drastically decrease through active efforts any different? 

I do understand that that is the role that judges are meant to have in the United States. That doesn't mean I agree with that role. There is no such thing as a non partisan judicial decision.

In 2017, he was ass against Indiana, even more ass against Toronto, great against Boston, and great against Golden State (although they lost in 5).

Optimization of the game makes everyone become samey. The narratives and history of teams wouldn’t be as interesting. If every championship team played like the 2014 Spurs, then their selflessness wouldn’t be as note-worthy.

This was a team that barely lost in 7 to the Clips just the year before with their only healthy center being Jermaine O'Neal, but now they had a new coach, a better system, a healthy center rotation, and elevated play from Steph, Klay, and Dray. And this is compared to a Clippers team which was pretty much unchanged from 13-14 to 14-15. I couldn't see a rational argument saying that the Clippers would be better than them in the playoffs; even the regular season series went 3-1 in the Warriors favor (I could understand if the Clippers won more games of that matchup, but they didn't).

"&gt; That players get ""in the zone"" is not in doubt.

The hard part is establishing statistical significance to those streaks/outlier performances.  If you flip a coin 100 times (let's say heads is a ""win""), you're going to have streaks of heads in there, as well as the reverse. A certain level of variance in ""performance"" outcomes is to be expected, even for a simple IID variable like a coin flip.  We wouldn't say the coin is ""in the zone"" just because it came up heads 5 times in a row (or maybe we would?).

I'm not saying players don't get ""in the zone"", just that proving it isn't as simple as merely observing that sometimes players have outlier performances, since a certain degree of outliers *should* be expected even if no such ""zone"" exists.  Quantifying all that in order to try to identify statistical significance is the challenge, which is why the research tends to focus on the simplest, easiest to objectively quantify examples (like shot percentages after makes and the like).",nba

He's a very good player but 2 players like Randle and Mirotic  aren't representative of the entire supporting cast.

2016? LOL

2017? harden/kawhi/westbrook all had better statistical seasons than lebron while the first 2 players' teams also had better records. lebron was no in the mvp discussion at all tthat year. not only that, but they played with less help that the lebron on the cavs; who managed to get a 51 win SECOND seed in the east. 51 wind in 2017 gets you 4-6 spot in the west

2018? harden clearly deserved it. not only deserved, but earned. i dont want to hear any bullshit about 82 games played or the ""if you remove xxx from xxx team, then they suck""

and (unpopular opinion )he shouldnt have even won the 2009 mvp, cavs struggled against all the top team in the league and in head to head with the runner up (kobe), they ended their undefeated streak at home; while at staples, lakers blew out the cavs by 20+.

There are however a lot of double last- and surnames so the real figure will be smaller than that. Not a real accurate measure by any means, I know. 

I just remembered that 3500 figure cause it seemed awfully low to me, but it ain’t far from the truth, if at all.
From this total number I’d conclude that there is quite a low turnover of players considering that the NBA is 80+ years old and a high turnover rate would amount to a higher total number of players.

"I don't understand the eastern conference argument. Is the west better? Sure but, at the end of the day, LeBron can only beat whoever is in front of him. 

And I do watch every single lakers game actually so yeah, I've watched him play. In fact, your claims that he's not playing defense would suggest that you're the one reading r/NBA and calling it ""watching games"". Does LeBron take defensive possessions off? Sure. Has he been more engaged in the past 4 or 5 games than previously? Definitely. I don't understand what people want from LeBron on defense sometimes. He's not going to guard the other team's best player when he's 34 and has to carry the majority of the offensive load. The possessions when he stands under the basket and waits for the defensive rebound are inexcusable, but to act like those haven't decreased significantly since the criticism about his defense and the reality that the lakers may miss (almost surely will now) the playoffs has kicked in is very misleading.

No one thinks he's equal to 2011-2014 defensively, but the circlejerk that he plays ""no defense"" has reached Harden levels of ridiculous. He takes plays off, he snoozes and loses his man, but confirmation bias makes you believe that's every play when every time he actually does stick to his man and contest a shot or force a pass you don't take the time to jot it down in your little notebook to rant about on r/nba.

LeBron does much more on offense than making freethrows or hitting his shots. He controls the pace of the game, creates opportunities for his teammates (arguably better than anyone else in the league), and pulls multiple defenders (usually even more than 2) consistently. 

EDIT: and what's up with discrediting stats? They don't tell the whole story, of course. The eye test is still extremely valuable and since you're apparently the only person who can claim to watch LeBron play, then you should know that the number of open shots that his teammates miss is absolutely ridiculous, even after some wonderful passes from LeBron. Stats still mean something. They're literally the best representation we have of what happened in the game outside of watching it. 

Of course LeBron carries some blame for the performance of this team, but it's nowhere near as much as people like you make it out to be and he certainly is not playing losing basketball. ",nba

"""... the denomination of the debt. The US can print dollars. Greece cannot print euro. You don't have to think this through very hard to see that this means the US can ALWAYS pay its debt in dollars, while Greece cannot say the same in euro.

Now, if the US prints dollars to pay its debt, that can cause inflation, but the cost of inflation is borne by everyone while the cost of default is borne by only the bondholder. This is not only a difference, but a vast difference--one which is easily large enough to change the result.

In the case of Greece, and countries like Greece, default on sovereign debt causes the banking system to fail, which is an existential problem for a modern economy. In the case of the US, and countries like the US, high inflation erodes wealth and creates various pernicious incentives, but it (almost) never causes the banking system to fail, although in very extreme examples it has been seen to do so occasionally, for example you could look at the Weimar Republic between WWI and WWII.

But if you did look at Weimar you would see what an extreme case it was, Germany having lost WWI and been saddled with huge reparations by the Treaty of Versailles, and the US is nowhere near that situation.

Bottom line, in Greece you get a collapsed banking system. In the US you get inflation. Many regard inflation as a problem, and rightly I think, but it's not as bad a problem as a collapsed banking system.""

The rest of the team needs to be fearless, whenever the big 2 are having an off-game, the team craters.",nba
"Exactly. When you play the refs all game with flops and whines  it gives the ref uncertainties about how to read the plays.

"The most frustrating part of the criticism of Lowry is that no one ever takes into account his injuries. Every time his shooting sucks, he's either injured or coming off an injury (and therefore doens't have rhythm yet).

"&gt; he has incredibly shot blocking ability, incredible rebounding ability

Those things will not translate to the NBA as good as you think, he's only 6""7, which is good in the NBA, but in the NCAA that's like being 7"". 

He really isn't like Lebron, and I feel sorry for him to get such an insane benchmark, it's really not fair. Lebron back in HS was renowned for the completeness of his game, his vision, his scoring, passing, the whole deal. It was the marriage of BBIQ and raw power that made the hype so crazy. In Zion, for now, it's mostly the brawn he's known for, not the brain.

"Not saying I believe this shit but if I were to put on my conspiracy hat I could find a few things.


Paul Pierce was 169 games and 2375 points from passing John Havlicek in all-time games/points in franchise history and was traded.

Rajon Rondo franchise leader in APG (8.5) was easily on pace to pass Bird, Havlicek and Cousy in total assists and got shipped out.

Isaiah Thomas broke Bird's franchise PPG record 24.7 in his Celtics career to Bird's 24.3 and immediately got shipped out after breaking his body and losing his sister during a ECF playoff run.

Kyrie Irving is currently third in franchise PPG at 24.0 and he will end up not returning.

Paul Pierce was stabbed and almost killed in a Boston nightclub.

Reggie Lewis died at an offseason practice facility in Waltham, Ma.

Len Bias died the day following signing ceremony with the Celtics' coaches and management.



TL;DR, Boston is racist, Celtics traded Pierce and Rondo because they didnt want them breaking White records. The Celtics attempted to Murder a young Paul Pierce but he survived thanks to teammate Tony Battie. They poisoned Len Bias during a signing ceremony and killed Reggie Lewis at a practice facility.",nba
"This exactly why Kyrie is going to LA. The 2nd option has it pretty good under LeBron. They're well respected, liked, but LeBron/Third Options/Coaches always take the blame. Kyrie was in a position where he was loved, considered a bad boy, but got to deflect much of the criticism. 

LeBron/""His legacy is over!""/The Lakers are going to be the focal point of next season. Kyrie knows that. He joins LA. The NBA cheats its way into the Lakers getting Zion, and then AD becomes a Laker.

"You're basically penalizing the coach for thinking statistically; some people's brains are wired that way, and it won't become the norm for most sideline interviews or anything unless the game becomes overly reliant on stats.

Anyway, since points per possession is obviously how many points are scored per possession, saying that ""we only allow 0.56 points per possession when we get into our half court defense"" should be as obvious as it looks; the Knicks don't allow many teams to efficiently score on a possession once they properly get into their half court defense.",nba

"&gt; IMO, yeah. Creating a superteam is worse than joining an existing superteam.

We'll have to agree to disagree on this. Creating a new team IMO is much less likely to fail than sliding into an existing one. Like if Lebron went to Boston (who while not as good as GS was when KD was a free agent and also older is the closest comparison I can make) would have been way worse than trying to build something new. 

&gt; Bron may have signed last, but there's no chance that Bosh and Wade signed without knowing Bron was on the way.
&gt;

I watched this very closely when it was on going (I was 20 at the time and was really diving into basketball that year). Bosh and Wade made public recruitment comments AFTER the signing to try and bring Lebron there (even on their duo Sportscenter announcement they alluded to it). There were reports from insiders that this was a power move by Bosh to tell Lebron that this was the only place he was going so if Lebron wanted to team up it would have to be Miami.

"""they just didnt know about it"" lmao. Hate to break it to you kid but basketball was never some big mystery. Teams wanted shooting and dribbling where they could get it, but it was just a nice bonus since you were required by rule to guard bad shooters and bad dribblers anyway.

"&gt; He is leading the league in deflections

....which is one of about 10 things that makes up being a good defender. This is maybe the only area he's actually above average at.

&gt; Sure he's a guard whose defence never even matter that much

This is just a ridiculous take. Guards' defense doesn't matter AS MUCH as centers, but they are still extremely important. You really don't think having someone who plays &gt;75% of your minutes who constantly gets beaten off the dribble and barely contests shots isn't important?

&gt; You're discounting how crazy Hardens season

When exactly did I discount Harden's season? Because I said he's a below average defender, which he is? He's the best offensive player in the league this year. But the gap between Giannis and Harden on defense/rebounding is about 5x as large as the offensive gap. Giannis also carries an insane burden and they're still 3rd in the NBA in offense (a fraction behind Houston).

&gt; he's legit doing 1/3 of the scoring for his team EVERY GAME

His USG is 10% points higher than Giannis's. So it's reasonable that his offensive output is about 10% higher. The TS% disparity is high enough for me that I'd do out on a limb and say that if Giannis took as many shots as Harden did, he'd average within 1 PPG of him.",nba
"This type of comment is what makes it so frustrating to actually talk about the step back, because Harden does travel sometimes when performing it.

But this is not a fucking travel. Not in 1950, not in 1970, not in 1990, and not now. He pushes off with his left foot. His right and left foot are then allowed to come down. From there it is a judgement call whether either foot can be his pivot, or if the right is since it landed first. In this case it is moot since he simply elevates for a jumper.

This is not even close to a travel. He still has his pivot foot and can step around with it, and even lift it after taking a step to elevate for a shot.",nba

Cricket will probably always be the number one sport in India and Pakistan, but as our countries develop, more sports will be given a chance. Most countries are exposed to a variety of sports - why is that so impossible to imagine in South Asia?",nba
"KD's shots to close out both Finals Game 3's were not wide open. Watch the tape.

I don't care if Lebron was double teamed (he wasn't) if you are the BEST IN THE WORLD you figure out how to win those games.

Don't give me Bullshit excuses.

The Cavs were obviously good enough to win both of those games.

2017 Game3 - up 6 with 2 minutes left

2018 Game3 - up 1 with 2 minutes left

You close those out.  Lebron literally just had to score 1 bucket in 2017 to win that game. 

Stop making excuses.  Lebron's teammates put him in prime position to win BOTH of those games and he failed.

Again I didn't expect Lebron to win either of those series. But going 1-8 is absolutely embarrasing.",nba

"Yeah he was as terrible in one game against them, from memory it was the first game they played. 

The other two he's been phenomenal, 32/6/3 in one game and 22/10/6 in the other (that one being 70% from the field and 2/2 from 3).


He fouled out in one game yes but in the others he only had 1 foul in thrir opening tilt and 2 fouls in their 3rd game so really, the other two games he barely fouled and he had one game against them when he fouled out, which seems to be just a random occurrence that happens to centres, rather than any trend. 

I meant no chance colloquially not literally 0 percent. I wouldn be very surprised if they pressed the nuggets to 7, let alone win said game 7 on the road against them.

The nuggets should and would be very clear favourites in that series. They've been phenomenal this season and finally seem to be fully healthy with Barton back and Millsap having played back to his regular form. I don't really see a way for the Spurs to stop what is a fantastic offense 4 games out of 7 in the playoffs. ",nba

"95% is 5% more than 90%, so you can say that someone who shot 95% makes shots at a probability 5% higher.

how *good* someone is based off these percentages is based on the difficulty of being 95% likely to make a shot vs 90% likely.

it easily could be that in order to shoot 95% vs 90% you have to be twice as good.

the actual numbers of the percentages arent the exact difference between levels.

"Think of it like this: before Jerry West, Clippers were a mess. They didn't know how to run a basketball franchise properly, be good in public relations or pick out the right players. The Donald Sterling era was all about profit over performance; he ran on a shoestring budget by consolidating two jobs to one person, or nixed a job altogether if ~~he found it to be expensive~~ it hurt his money. This practice continued during the transition to Steve Ballmer. Then you have Doc Rivers who became president just to prevent Sterling from screwing things up (which he had a major habit in doing over the years), with the unintended consequence of screwing things up himself. He signed players who played for him before or defeated him, he traded draft picks to erase his own mistakes, he even traded for his own son. Then you have the Lob City era with the teammates not get along with one another, the repeated playoff disappointments, the sour behavior that was expressed on the court. The front office knew these problems but were afraid to do anything about them because they feared turning back into the Sterling era Clippers. Trade Chris Paul, you're back in the lottery. Trade Blake Griffin, you're back to being losers forever.

With Jerry West, the front office is making the right decisions. The coach is only coaching, not running the business side or being a father to his son. The team was so distracted with wanting to be loved, respected and worshiped like Lakers, West had to make them understand that respect must be earned, not handed down to you. Instead of the superstar trick he did for Lakers and Warriors, he opted to turn the Clippers into a Hollywood version of the Spurs, something Doc Rivers was aspiring for ever since he came to Los Angeles, but could never do right because of the Sterling factor. Not a single player has made the All-Star Game, but not a single player has a bad ego trip that would make casual fans take notice. Here's how I know: before the Tobias Harris trade, Clippers were 0-6 in games where one of their players or coach was ejected from a game. Since the trade, 1-0, that win being where Doc Rivers and Bulls coach Jim Boylen were thrown out.

You can credit the guys who actually acted out on the moves because of their title. But nothing of this sort would have ever happened without the advisory of one Jerry West.",nba

"Thanks for posting this. To add on, I searched for every rookie 22 and under with 1000 minutes and a BPM under -5, There were about 20 guys. A bunch ofc were busts but there were legit good players in there like Allan Houston, Mahmoud Abdul Rauf, Jim Paxson and Jamal Crawford along with a few solid role players like Austin Rivers, Nick Young, Antonio Daniels and Kenny Gattison. 

Not exactly stars, but there’s no reason to completely panic and just write off Knox and Sexton. Both of those guys are the first lottery picks in there in 6 years (Rivers) so it’s possible they’re historic busts. It’s also very possible that the Cavs and the Knicks are historically bad teams to give rookies such a massive green light, which doesn’t necessarily break with the eye test. They could easily be solid to really good players in the future.

I admittedly liked Knox before the draft but I never expected him to become a star, rather a flexible stretch 4 who can create a little bit and fit with other stars. There are definitely concerns but I’m not gonna panic based off his rookie numbers",nba

Hawks had 3 straight first round exits on sub 45 win teams.  Won 60 games and got to Con Finals.

Celtics missed the playoffs 2 straight years.  Added 2 good players and immediately won a ring.

"The average redditor knows this one truth. The best way to state your case is to first form your conclusion and then make the facts fit. My personal favorite is the bitching about Klay/Draymond making an All-Star team followed by the “of course the Warriors won they have 5 All-Stars.” 

For me LMA is the most frustrating great player of this generation. The guy can flat out dominate when he wants and so often settles for the easy shot.

He's got some decline left in him which will effect the rate numbers a little but right now he's 4th among all players in WS/48 (well ahead of the next PG, Magic, at #8) and 8th in PER, also well ahead of the next PG (also Magic, at #15).

There are a decent chunk who might be close but I wouldn't say 4 PGs out of the entire league is ""a good amount."" Granted, those are somewhat arbitrary numbers to pick, but the point is those numbers aren't as easy to get as you might think.

Honestly, I still think Fox has room for improvement defensively (navigating screens, man to man defense especially in the paint) and tends to gamble a bit on defense which is why he'll get blocks and steals, but it's still a positive sign.",nba

"&gt; To be fair I think the Lakers are just delusional rather than dysfunctional. 

But I feel like it actually fits a bit better the *other* way? 

The Lakers have a deep seated belief in their exceptionality, because they're ""The Lakers"". And actually, that isn't wrong? Like, the whole premise of delusion is if the Lakers are deluded about their ability to pull FAs. And maybe they were wrong on PG. But they landed the biggest free agent in the world, purely based on their brand.

So maybe some overstate this exceptionalism. Some Lakers fans think they can just point to a player, and get them. But it isn't delusion to think the Lakers have a special advantage. When it *mattered*, they signed the biggest FA in the world based purely off their brand. AD wanted to play with them just fine (the Pelicans just didn't want the trade). 

It's actually *dysfunction*, not delusion, that seems to be the issue right now. The Lakers as an organization have been exceptionally poorly run, just as poorly run as any of the other bottom feeders in the league.

Now, the fact is, given that they *aren't* deluded, their brand does make them vastly more likely to break this cycle than the other teams on this list.  They have Lebron James on their team, and have a shot at pulling other superstars. They have a very good chance to be a top team soon, unlike these other teams. 

But this is *in spite* of their dysfunction, which is obvious. If they succeed, it won't be because we all underestimated how well the Lakers were run. It will be because, Lakers fans were correct (and not deluded) that they are a hugely prestigious team that players *want* to play for.

TLDR: The Lakers are *not* particularly deluded (they landed Lebron James!), but they *are* dysfunctional, so I strongly disagree with this.",nba

"&gt; Giannis is a freak, but he's really only got one way to attack a defense

That's not true. You either haven't watched Giannis or have a simplistic understanding of the game. He lacks an outside shot, but he's a 6'11"" athletic freak who can score in transition, from the perimeter by driving, and also by posting up.    

&gt;in a seven game series it's easier to adjust and counter   

Absolutely. Bud is a pretty good coach. He gets to adjust too. Not many coaches in the East are going to straight up fool him.   

And in any series in the East, Milwaukee has the best player. That counts for something. You can take things away from him, but an MVP level player can't be just shut down by scheme. They impose their will on the game. You're acting like he's an Embiid, Simmons, Lillard, Oladipo, etc... level of player who can be schemed around. I don't think that will apply to Giannis any more than it does to a guy like Durant.

"Yeah this is true. I obviously remember that season pretty vividly (being the 73-9, 3-1, etc.). Kerr basically had the offense established and all Walton had to do was keep running it.

He didn't need to do much tbh. I do distinctly remember a bad use (or lack thereof) of timeouts and it always seemed like Walton was never the best at ""managing a game"" because he never needed to.

Rightfully so. Kobe quite literally did more for the franchise, stayed longer, didn't disrespect Doctor Buss (aka the one guy that was universally loved), didn't play for the Celtics, didn't come back from offseasons 50 lbs overweight and took until January to get into shape. He asked for a trade - sure, but he took the criticism we levied at him and earned us back. His resume as a Laker is peerless. 

Again, another free lesson that you can't find in box scores.",nba
What? No I dont lmao. Either way he came back to a team fully capable of making the playoffs and through his own laziness on defense and blowing up of the locker room with his usual LePolitics he made that next to impossible. A 36 win pace will never be more impressive than a 50 win pace especially considering the Lakers won pretty nuch the same amount of games last year with Julius Randle in his place.

With Hiel an Russell, a big part of the growth is being in a situation where they actually get the ball and get to shoot.  Siakam has managed this huge leap in a secondary role on the team.

"This article was written by a former NBA player, Etan Thomas, who has personal experience with the racist and abusive treatment given to black athletes at Jazz games, and he may have a point with what he's saying. Gail Miller's late husband, the now deceased Larry Miller from whom she inherited the team, broke his TV contract with UPN back in 2001 [because he felt UPN was showing too much ""urban/ethnic programming"" on their station:](https://variety.com/2000/tv/news/salt-lake-dust-up-1117788177/)

&gt; According to a copy of KJZZ’s final affiliation renewal proposal obtained by Daily Variety, the station demanded the right to drop UPN if the network added any more series deemed too “urban.”
&gt; 
&gt; In the letter, submitted to UPN two weeks ago, KJZZ — run by Larry Miller, who also owns the Utah Jazz basketball franchise — requested the option, “with 90 day written notice, to cancel this contract should UPN increase the urban/ethnic programming above the current two hours per week.”
&gt; 
&gt; According to the netlet, KJZZ also requested — though not in writing –the right to move UPN’s Monday night block of urban sitcoms out of primetime permanently.

At the time this happened, Gail Miller was still married to Larry (as she had been since 1965 and was up until his death in 2009), and of course, David Stern was the NBA commissioner at the time. Stern did nothing to address any of this, just like how he similarly did nothing to address any of the [decades long issues of obvious racism that Clippers owner Donald Sterling publicly displayed.](http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story?page=jones/060810) It wasn't till Adam Silver took over that we *finally* saw some movement on that front.

So *maybe* Etan Thomas is wrong to make that leap in giving some credit for the good handling of this latest incident to Adam Silver when it may have 100% been all decided to proceed like this by Gail Miller. But it's sure not a slam dunk to say that's the case.",nba

All of this being said, culture is a massive part of the schooling experience.

"Something worth looking at are the types of analytics being done like here:
http://www.basketballanalyticsbook.com/2018/04/19/anthony-davis-rates-as-the-nbas-best-defender-in-2017-18/

This is interesting as it shows that Towns (last year) had a pretty strong interior defensive rating but a fairly poor exterior defensive rating.

In this evaluation, his total defensive rating using this methodology is not fantastic, but still positive and still top-90 or so.

But you can really see a massive gap with a guy like Covington who has a PDR of 7.0 + IDR of -0.2 while someone like Teague has a PDR of 1.3 and IDR of -2.4. Wiggins is negative on both metrics with -1.3 PDR and -1.7 IDR.

This type of approach is potentially a bit more fair as it doesn't rate guys like Westbrook all that high.

But even this shows that Towns last season wasn't terrible, just not fantastic. And I'd say his defense has been better this year in general. (Although I'm curious to see what the total numbers are by this metric at the end of the season.)",nba
"I’m going to go in to bat for my boy.

I’ll say he’s nowhere near all NBA and he’s not on the level of most all star starters.

But what I will say is that you look at guys rated around the same as him. Beal. Holiday. Conley. Griffin. I’ll even add in Jimmy Butler. Did these guys single handedly lead their squads to playoffs carrying the whole offensive load? Beal hasn’t and he had Wall and Porter for half the season. Holiday hasn’t and he had Anthony fucking Davis for half the season. Conley didn’t, ok fine his roster isn’t that great IMO although personally I think it’s neck and neck with ours excluding our star PG. Blake didn’t and his team was probably worse than ours until Reggie and Drummond started playing like borderline all stars.

Even Dame Lillard who I’ll take 10 days out of 10 over Kemba has always had Aldridge or CJ(in his most improved year) as a second teammate to carry the offensive burden.

Lamb has never reached close to all star or MIP level. No one on this hornets team really has consistently looked like starting caliber second option for Kemba. Even like the Jazz have a consensus top five coach, DPOY lock, a legitimate 9 deep roster and their biggest defensive liability is probably Mitchell who at least has wingspan and athleticism.

The last two years our teams were dreadful honestly so I’m not gonna use hat as a blight against Kemba. What I will say is, almost every defence we go up against is putting two guys on Kemba, making sure he’s double teamed if he gets into the paint. If Kemba kicks it out our best shooter is Marvin who clanks everything in the fourth quarter. It’s just not a fair fight and I think whilst almost every year teams have planned for Kemba, this is the first year it feels like he can have an impact every game despite getting exposed the most for his lack of size.

I don’t think Kemba is a top 25 player personally, but I also don’t think it’s fair to have him lower than Donovan Mitchell or Bradley Beal. Kemba isn’t a good defender because he’s small but he actually has really good lateral speed so even if he gets burned off a screen he contests hard, he takes charges. Yes he’s fallen off since the start of the season but that’s because teams realise that when you give him single coverage he punishes you like Boston and Philly found out.

How many times do you seen zone defence, box and 1 and flat out double teams work in the NBA. They are one of the worst possible defensive schemes most of the time because usually NBA teams have 5 capable offensive players who can shoot, pass or drive. We don’t. Against a zone if we create open shots they are bricked, or Cody/Marvin brick a layup/floater. The supporting cast for Kemba just isn’t enough, and even if Malik comes good we become worse defensively because of carrying two guys who are both about 5 inches undersized for their positions(Kemba is literally like 5’10”)",nba
"Team was not built for long term, mentally was not prepped for games without Bron, young guys not ready to take the reigns, vets not good enough to do so. Then they fell in standings, and the pressure got to them at the trade deadline and beyond.

"I guess I just don't get your point? Fringe playoff teams with the 16-20th best record aren't likely to draft players that are stars right out of the gate, unless they have some sort of draft day trade to move up in the draft or win the lottery. No shit. If players in the 8-14 draft range were impact players right out of the gates and leading their team to the playoffs those players would have likely gone 1st.  Making an impact immediately is a very hard thing to do. 

Your parameters (fringe playoff team, draft a late lottery rookie, they make an immediate impact and are a star player, make the playoffs that players rookie season) create a situation that is nearly impossible. There is hardly any instance of a middling team that misses the playoffs, then drafts an impact star with the 8th-14th pick and proceeds to make the playoffs. Regardless if it's the East or West conference. The closest you can get is the 2007-08 Bulls with a 33-49 record, then drafted Derrick Rose and make the playoffs the following season with 41 wins. He was good but hardly a 9 game difference maker. He averaged 17/7. He was also the #1 pick, he was expected to be good, and the Bulls were hardly a playoff contender. The East was just hot garbage that year. 

Obviously players are going to improve and if a team narrowly misses the playoffs (like the teams you mentioned), chances are they have other young talent from previous drafts and are steadily improving (a la Golden State with Curry, Denver with Jokic etc) and naturally they will make the playoffs if their trajectory continues. The only time huge impact players enter the league, they are almost always #1 or #2 picks and go to a 15 win team.

"Yes and no... It's a bit more complicated imo     
       
The Lakers' first pick has indeed raised its value, but only if it's traded to NO before the draft (or Pels and Lakers agree on a player to draft and trade). However, any further Lakers picks than that still lose most of their value since the team will be obviously way better, and Lakers still don't have other teams' picks to sweeten the deal, unlike Boston or other teams.       
         
Ingram's DVT is a question mark, really. It could flare up again next year or never bother him again until he's 50, you have no way of knowing when a clot will form again, and with no way to prevent it and knowing it's practically a season-ending illness if it does come up again for him, I'd be surprised if he didn't suffer from being given less money/shorter term deals. He's not a player you can max anymore, even if this particular instance of the clot doesn't leave long term damage. IIRC he had to get studies done to determine whether he's got a genetic predisposition for it or it was just a one-time thing, though I don't know what turned out from that. You should also mention that the 19 athletes statistic includes players from other sports, which definitely affects the way the stat is perceived - an upper extremity DVT is less of a concern for, say, soccer, than basketball, simply because of the strain and use of different muscles.      
         
I'd say overall the package has either gone slightly down, or stayed at the same value, with the added value of a possibly top 10 pick offsetting the down value of knowing Lonzo is injury-prone. BUT the big thing to consider is not the Lakers' package value in a vacuum, but in relation to other available packages, and that's where I really think the value is lost: whereas teams were reluctant to make serious offers to NOLA during the season (either being locked out like the C's or from teams not wanting to have their players know they're on the trade block mid-season and alienate them, like the L's did), every team can now seriously consider retooling and making offers to the Pelicans, however enticing they may be. The Lakers package lost value by mere fact of having to compete against 28 other teams' offers.",nba

I think if he had the conditioning, which so few rookies do, he would be at 24/7.5/6 which is already all NBA levels. 

After that all he needs to do is get incrementally better at things, add a new thing to his game every year like James Harden. Add a floater, improve first step speed, etc. He’s already so good that if he just improves by 5% on all his stuff I think he’s a top 10 player in the league by his 3rd year, and he’ll be an all star next year.

If you aren’t even the best of the generation in which you’ve played at your position, how can you be “generational”?

Here's the Bucks with Giannis in the playoffs:

- Bulls series: way too young and no talent
- Raptors series: Giannis played great and for three games the Bucks gave the Raptors all they could handle but the lack of production outside of Giannis, Khris, Thon and the stupidity of Potatohead did them in
- Celtics series: the Bucks pushed the Celtics the hardest they were pushed during the playoffs, even harder than Cleveland. Brogdon was coming of a huge injury from a torn hamstring and played like doo doo, Bledsoe played the worst games of his career, and only Giannis and Khris played great. Potohead's coaching staff was still there the weight the whole thing down...

No, Giannis is not at Peak KG level yet. Peak KG was as good as peak Duncan/Shaq in the Regular season. Peak KG was a better passer and much better defender than Giannis.

I don't give any fucks about playoffs wins in this comparison either. Hell, you put KG out East and he probably makes a some ECF's. ",nba

If anything I feel for teams who  have stars like Embiid and the team can easily fight a 5th spot and above. Very high impact but his durability is an annual concern. So you would rather have him play at full strength even if it means he plays 60 games and have him try take the team far into the playoffs.

They both have foundations and do a ton of charitable work. They both also have opened schools and stuff.

It's a close race and there will be some tough decisions. I don't have any personal feelings toward Kawhi. I have hard time rewarding someone who sit the third of season for load management over a player who carried his team (to maybe 50 wins) every game in a tough conference. The same goes for LBJ. He doesn't defend at all. He puts the numbers, but the lakers are 7 games below .500. Being inactive on defense saves him energy for his numbers on offense. If you are always active on both ends like Pop asks to, it takes a lot energy, especially for frontcourt players who have to protect the paint and defend opposing guard when they decide to switch and LMA is able to do both.

LMA is really underrated. People praise the spurs, but it would only take an injury and him missing a few games to realize how important he is to the spurs, with or without Pop.",nba

He was fighting through all kinds of screens and chasing PG around. Raptors did everything they could to keep kawhi on PG...And he held PG to 19 points due to playing great defense. Most of the shots PG took weren’t even on kawhi, but kawhi played such good initial defense that he prevented PG from even getting shots off all night. And then in OT he locked down Westbrook and prevented HIM from getting shots off( when he was guarding him). This whole game was kawhi trying hard on defense and as a result a return to his 2 time DPOY form, or damn near close to it. I see this being the way kawhi plays on defense in the playoffs, and it’s gonna be a huge boost.",nba

It's also really hard to ref someone like Curry who flails his limbs out when he shoots. I get he's trying to protect his ankles, but as a ref that makes it very hard to see if he's getting fouled. Abd you have players like Harden, who built much of their game around drawing contact.

You can't just negate Harden's stats by saying that ""if Giannis shot more he'd have similar stats"" when the fact is that Giannis shoots less and plays less because he has others on his team capable of scoring and so he is less central to their offense.

There are several minute stretches within games that LeBron rests.  He won't sit (because LeBron gotta stat) but he rests on the floor.  During those rest periods he will frequently not get back on defense, and when he does he choses not to actually play defense (by not helping, rotating, or closing out on shooters).  

Its not uncommon during these rest periods for him to stand well outside the arc and not move for full offensive possessions either - hadn't bothered mentioning that the first time around.

If he had a *single* event of a 9th make, and the chart said ""9 - 100%"" the interpretation is ""OMG he basically can't miss because he's so hot once he's made 8 in a row!""

When, the reality is, we don't have nearly enough information at that point to have any idea what his ""true"" percentage after 9 makes would be in an extrapolated fashion. It could easily be that he just shoots his normal percentage after 8 makes in a row. He could even shoot less. Who knows!

More and more wings and length are given more importance but that's outside of MJ's control. The guy was 6'6 and long enough to thrive in today's league. He had huge palms and was insanely clutch.

If you’re going to use hardens usage against him shouldn’t you factor that into why he has so many turnovers? Giannis can’t really play in a pick and roll offense because then it’d be easier pack the paint on him. He’s very fortunate to have brook lopez there’s nothing wrong with that,nba
I was more or less referencing how he was on a bad team (before Lebron) but now he is on a decent team (Celtics) so he could fall into this category. I know what he did with the cavs with bron and love but I think looking at the Celtics and what he does with them is a bit more interesting ,nba

There just was no chance to. That 02 playoffs was probably the first year where i really got to see him for more than a few games, and to see someone that tall, shoot and move the way he could - off the dribble and driving on someone as good defensively as KG, was shocking to me at the time.

Its because Lebron wants SPACING. He wants 3-point shooters everywhere. Problem is it is very hard to find guys who are great shooters and defenders.

If Lebron got better defenders then his offense would struggle.

Either way KD is putting up 30-35 per game on 65-70%.  He is unstoppable. Just face it. Even Kawhi Leonard had ZERO shot of slowing down KD.  KD is 4-1 versus the Spurs in the playoffs.

"I honestly am not arguing with you about the idea that Europe is racist, and there are enough anecdotes from soccer players alone to justify that. And (I'll do more research on this myself) but you very well may be right that many European countries are MORE racist than the US. But I really think you missed the point I was trying to make because I was never debating that.

Additionally a point I think is important is that comparing which country is more or less racist isn't a productive conversation that furthers a productive discussion on racism. For example New Yorkers could say ""well we didn't have Jim Crow"" about the south, but that doesn't absolve them of the racial issues in New York. And it doesn't get to the heart of what race is, it's function or how racist ideas persist and evolve.

Maybe America is discussed more because it is the preminent world power for the last century, is more what I meant in terms of being discussed. Everyone knows American politics etc. and they are more heavily scrutinized due to their position as a super power.",nba

"&gt; Lakers are going to become the Knicks with James Dolan. You have an ego driven owner who won't accept that they aren't specialized in making basketball decisions and will NEVER sell the team.

There are pretty significant differences between Jeanie Buss and James Dolan, and I'm not talking about personality-wise or their abilities as owners or whatever, I'm just talking about their authority over their respective teams. Dolan flat out owns the Knicks, so he'll only sell them or step away if he wants to, nobody can make him. 

Jeanie Buss, however, does not outright own the Lakers. She and her 5 siblings each have an equal partnership in the Buss Trust which itself owns 2/3rds of the Lakers. Jeanie doesn't actually own any more of the Lakers than any of her siblings do, she's just the one that's currently elected as the controlling owner. The board could vote to replace her with someone else, either another Buss sibling or somebody else to be the controlling owner. 

Or if 4 of the 6 Buss children decided to sell the Buss Trust's stake in the Lakers, they would have to do it, even if Jeanie didn't want to. Already two of the Buss children have made it known that they want to sell their stake in the team (Joey and Jim), so if any two other siblings joined them, then the Buss family would no longer have any ownership stake in the Lakers (the Anschutz Entertainment Group has the right to be the first bidder for their shares, as they are the 2nd largest minority ownership group in the Lakers currently).

"Alright now that I'm home, I can provide some scientific proof that doesn't add any racial bias that you claim. If you'd like to educate yourself, please take a chance to read my summary of the studies I have read and what I know, and the links I provide which back that up. 

People of African decent generally have more fast twitch muscle fibers, this is observed in biology (not racist as you falsely claim). A lot of this is attributed to the ACTN3 (alpha-actinin-3) Gene, which has R and X varients. The R variant determines speed, power, explosicity, etc, and this variant is observed higher in black people more than any other race. There is also the ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) Gene, which determines heart pumping capacity, and black people tend to have the D allele more than other races which helps with athletic performance. The summary is that these genes cause the production of fast twitch muscle fibers (for athleticism) at a higher rate than other races, such as white people who have more slow twitch muscle fibers (endurance, so think runners and cyclists, etc.). Anecdotally, obviously there are athletic white men and endurance black men (Kenyans for example) but scientifically they are likely to have more fast twitch fibers. 

The best scientific source I could find for more details is The Physique of the Olympic Athlete by James Tanner, a journal published in the 1960s, which has been backed up by several similar studies. You'd have to purchase that, but here's a good summary of the original and many follow up studies that you can read: http://run-down.com/guests/je_black_athletes_p2.php

"This is literally false. 

Rapm has Lamar as a slightly over average player, nothing to write home about. 



Lamar Odom is weak second option, his impact gets better as he becomes a third or a fourth option. 

Lamar was an inconsistent shooter, and was consistently average as an offensive player during his tenure. Even looking at his raw on/off for high sample, he’s around a plus 1.4 offensive rating guy. This is extremely mediocre for a playoff second option, if not below average. To put this in perspective, Kobe was a fucking plus 11 guy offensively. 

However, he WAS their best defensive player... but that’s really not a fair comparison considering Bron’s team was relatively stacked defensively and Kobe’s team was pretty mediocre on that end. 

If I mention all those garbage players and you try to refute by saying Lamar Odom, your take is laughable. Lamar Odom was a very weak second option.

* Wiggins is downright awful on offense, highly inconsistent, highly inefficient, has no interest in facilitating and doesn't go hard for rebounds despite his size. He is not a good mid-range shooter. He does the nasty 4 games a year against Oklahoma City and sometimes against the Lakers or Cavs

* We were 37-22 before Jimmy went down last year. That's pretty good in a stacked West. This year Jimmy blew everything up to leave and we went 4-9 before he left. We are currently 5 games under .500 and Jimmy lost us some of those games singlehandedly and yes won a few singlehandedly. But, he doesn't do that and we're at least at .500. Those 5 losses matter in the West.

Elite  players have to change their game to mold into the team. Jordan actually had to start scoring less in order to get a championship. He’s spoken about it before. Going out and preforming well individually is easier then being a player that can lead a squad to a championship. Especially when the team isn’t capable of winning without you. 

Also that your team has a lot to do with winning the mvp if your team sucks the chances of you getting the mvp reduce. ",nba

Moreover, he did this for the previous four year in Cleveland. Last year’s trade deadline moves were also prompted, dramatically, by LeBron and made in an attempt to appease his public unhappiness.

He’s an all rounder not a pass first or a score first. If he was a score first he’d probably have career numbers of like 22/7/11 because he has all that passing ability but he’s not pass first by any means. How rare is it for people to take as many shots as Harden does though too?,nba
"Indeed.

And I misspoke earlier. They have been players who scored 0 PTS and played 48 minutes, but Wilt is the player who played the most minutes (46) without a single field goal attempt or free throw attempt.

The game was March 27, 1973. Wilt's stat line:

* 46 Minutes
* 14 boards
* 4 assists
* 0 FGAs
* 0 FTAs

And the Lakers lost by 1, lol.

So Wilt has the record for most points scored in a single game and the most minutes played in a single game without attempting a single free throw or field goal. He was an interesting cat.

"i don't think anyone has approached harden's volume in over a decade. I think Melo had a couple of seasons where he created 62%+ of his offense, which is a lot for a forward (or it was a lot until point forwards became more common in the last few years). Harden is creating around 87% of his offense.

I wish they had possession stats from earlier years though. Would be easy to compare and look at Harden's season relative to other great isolation players. ",nba

"The funny thing is, the Rockets with Harden on the bench have a better net rating than the Bucks with Giannis on the bench.  

The Rockets have a +3.3 net rating with Harden on and a +3.4 rating with Harden off.

The Bucks have a +12.3 net rating with Giannis on and a +3.2 rating with Giannis off.

Harden plays a lot more minutes and has missed fewer games, helping him.  He also carries such a high offensive load and raises his game when teammates get hurt that he gives his team a fantastically high floor, Rockets can't get too bad when he is out there.

Giannis's per minute production/effectiveness is arguably even better, though, and comes in the context of a more dominant team.

I think both players have a fair argument for MVP.  Paul George actually has the best on/offs of the contenders.  ",nba

"Outside of a good game 2 in that Utah series PG didn't live up to his defensive reputation at all that series.

Excluding several times he got beat and Ingles passed out to open guys due to the D having to collapse Ingles having rewatched the game in these 91 poss had 25 pts while vs PG. Again this excludes all other poss and some off ball rotations he missed. Not elite by any standard.

Last 3 quarters of game 5 and game 6: He covered Donovan Mitchell. Game 5 he kept showing too little resistance switching off Mitchell and letting him repeatedly get matchups he wanted vs Melo or a big. Game 6 he covered him 31 times per matchup data. Excluding times he got switched off Mitchell he alone vs Mitchell allowed 17 pts on 5/10 shooting including multiple And 1s. On just 31 poss that's awful

I mean, an NBA star asks you back to his place at 2am to do what..? She agreed to go and I can’t think of too many other reasons for her to willingly go, other than to bang. 

Not to mention she said the 64k was for her brother’s college? I mean if she’s living in NYC, in an expensive place that millionaires live in, you’re telling me she would just let a rape slide for what is probably less than a year’s worth of rent? 

Again, rape is an awful fucking thing but her story doesn’t add up at all. Im guessing she tried for months to blackmail him and threatened to go public and when he refused, she reported the allegations. 

The bottom line is whoever is at fault here, needs to be severely punished. If KP is found guilty he deserves to have his name dragged through the mud forever and will probably wind up out of the league since no one will want to sign him.

IMO Harden has to be top 2 seed to win it. It is not as if Giannis has slowed down in the meanwhile. All the teams Harden won, Giannis did too, often more times, often due to taking over in the 4th (like in the last one with the Pacers).

They had their hand forced by the NBA...[then explains how the NBA doesn't put things in writing they just ""strongly recommend"" things]...What they strongly recommended the Pelicans do is they play Davis every possible game you can play him, but not only that, he isn't allowed to deviate from his average minutes by a significant amount. So it's not like you can just check him in and sub him out 3 minutes into the 1st quarter and call it a night. No, you're looking to play him 27, 30, 33 minutes a night...

&gt;...What if the Pelicans go ""screw you guys, I'm gonna just eat whatever fines you throw at us"" because it's just simply not worth us risking our asset. Well, they can't, because the fines are daily fines and they grow and then you get into the loss of draft picks.

It’s just super impressive that Giannis was able to destroy Gobert like that.

there are specialized medical centers throughout the globe depending on the case. I think most of them are in the US but not all of them. if you consider the rarity of the case is kind of silly to spend billion of dollars in each country just to deal with a case or two per year. it is much better to have one medical center that will deal with all the cases worldwide.  so it is not a matter of obstacles or incompetence from the side of europe. just an international cost-effective plan.,nba

"Once?  He's gotten a critical flop in 3 different games LMAO.

Andre holds him under his rebounding averages, forces him into 3+ turnovers every time including a 7 turnover game, has embiid over his PF average.  Embiid always takes the game personally, has only had 1 game where he bothered to pass the ball at all.

You sixers fans are so caught up in the narrative HE spins I don't think you've watched how frustrated he gets w/ Andre.  He's good enough to win shooting fuckawful midrange shots over a 7' player.  But Andre often makes him take fuckawful contested midrangers, he creates deflections on post entries like crazy, etc.  You can play a good player well, make them uncomfortable, and still have them score.

I have no doubt that Embiid could still have great games if he played them straight up.  He hasn't yet, he's spent all his energy flailing like a fish trying to draw fouls and crying when someone bigger than him doesn't let him do what he wants.",nba

"Bro a team with just Wiggins and Jimmy and Gorgui Dieng starting at center is not better than what the team was with Karl Wiggins and Jimmy. The 5-7 when KAT scores over 30 is as cherry picked as the Celtics being 6-0 without Kyrie and 0-6 with Kyrie ~ it depends on what teams they were playing. His supporting cast is absolutely weaker than AD's. Jrue Holiday alone is better than Wiggins and Teague on both ends of the floor, add in guys like Randle and come on. 

This is a really bad take. The team was better with Jimmy because he is a top 5 two way player in this league. It's some bullshit to say he's hunting stats or whatever when he literally doesn't have a reliable second option. I don't think you really have watched Timberwolves games if you don't realize that. Karl defers to his teammates when they're on - he's deferred to Wiggins every time they play OKC. It's really dumb to say him putting up numbers doesn't help the team when nobody else can really do it. That's his job as the franchise player, he has to put up those numbers. What do you think he's being paid for?

What evidence do you have that he only cares about stats? I looked it up and I can't find anything about Jimmy or Jamal Crawford talking about that. All I've seen is that Jimmy was mad he didn't care about losing and didn't play good defense and didn't work hard. I don't think Butler minded that a guy on his team was putting up numbers. You score points to win. That's how it works.",nba

That's part of the reason why I don't get the hate Warriors fans get. Warriors fans aren't talking like this is how it's always going to be, they're just partying it up for as long as it lasts.

We've got all that history of being between absolutely terrible and ""just good enough to lose in the playoffs"".

Most of us think that we're headed right back to there once this group falls apart and/or gets old - like we don't believe we can actually change what we are and that this wonderful stretch is just an extreme aberration.

At the back of all the partying is this very real belief that it's going to firmly end.

Imagine if Chicago Bulls fans not only weren't surprised by the drop back into being mediocre once Jordan retired for the second time, but almost seemed relieved by it because mediocre was more comfortable to them.

That's what it feels like the Warriors fandom is doing - partying, but almost wishing for the bad times to return because winning is too stressful.",nba

"Actually, MJ was more of a good defender by 96 than the elite one he had been in the late 80s/early 90s. In 96, Phil Jackson started using Ron Harper to guard the other teams best guard and Pippen was taking the best player. Look at what young Damon Stoudamire and Pooh Richardson did to older Jordan - MJ couldn't guard either of them, when he would've shut them down if he was still 85-93 MJ. He was still a good defender, but not elite.

All-defensive teams have always been influenced by narrative, past performance, and offensive performance. Look at Butler last season - Richardson should've gotten that nod (Smart could've too).",nba

"I used to have a blog dedicated to the Spurs. I wrote this (10?) years ago. I have countless joyful memories of his play, and he will always be my favorite player. (My apologies in advance if the formatting is garbage.)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

While watching the Spurs / Hornets game from the anti-bowels of the Where the Spurs Play Center, Wayne commented how much faster Tony seemed in person.

&amp;#x200B;

I think Wayne was right.

&amp;#x200B;

There was one particularly telling fast break.  Sean Marks, back-pedaling at the elbow, was essentially the only guy back for the Hornets.  Tony ran at him full speed, went around him and then laid the ball in *on the same side of the basket*.  All Marks had to do was turn around, take one step and block the shot.  He didn't even get turned around.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course Tony does this every game, against all sizes of opponent.  But seeing it live and realizing the guy still seems ridiculously fast when he's 200 feet away from you... it gives you a different appreciation for his insane athletic ability, like watching a cheetah chasing down a gazelle from a helicopter.  Except Tony only has two legs. 

&amp;#x200B;

And he didn't eat Sean Marks.

&amp;#x200B;

But my brains can make sense of Tony's greatness.  The NBA is obviously comprised of world class athletes.  Even amongst them, Tony's one of the fastest end to end, and few can match his quickness.  He understands how to attack individual defenders on the fast break and has the ability to finish with either hand on either side of the basket.  I understand why Tony is one of the 25 best players in the NBA.  It's not complicated.

&amp;#x200B;

But I cannot figure out why Manu Ginobili is even in the top 100, let alone the top 20.

&amp;#x200B;

He's not overly quick.  He's not a great leaper.  He's not a *great* shooter.  What most befuddles me is how he continually, repeatedly, over and over again, ad nauseum, get wide open step-back jumpers from 18 feet.  He'll face a guy up, work some hypnotizing voodoo or some shit, and wind up taking an essentially unguarded 18' jump shot.  Most of the time the defender doesn't even get a hand in his face.

&amp;#x200B;

It's as if Manu has learned how to imbalance his opponent, how to get him shifting the wrong way.  More importantly, he seems to anticipate the vulnerability and execute his step-back as the imbalance is occurring.

&amp;#x200B;

He ends up with all the time in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

(This must drive other NBA players crazy.  It's one thing for a guy like Lebron to get the best of you.  That's explainable.  Just look at the guy.  He's a freak.  Dwight Howard?  Freak (plus he prays and stuff).  Tim Duncan?  Tall (plus he's boring so he doesn't count).  Kobe?  Quick as hell, amazing athlete, crazier than shit.  Yao Ming?  Crazy communist genetic-engineering.  Chris Paul?  Ridiculously quick hands and first step.  Etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how Manu got to be this way.  Maybe it's purely instinctual.  Maybe he read Book of Five Rings and it all came together in a shroom-induced fury of clearheadedness.  Maybe I'll take the ~~sportswriter's~~ easy way out and credit his time playing soccer.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder if even he knows the origin, the planting of the seed.  I think he does.  I think he guessed the ending of the *The Usual Suspects* and can sense magma shifting miles beneath the surface of his earth.  I think he's trying to unravel the very foundational fibers of the NBA.  I think he's diabolical.  I think he's formed a one-manned cabal.

&amp;#x200B;

The evidence is there.

&amp;#x200B;

He'll dribble through a guy's a leg or go around his back during a layup, but only when necessary.  He'll occasionally try to dunk on somebody, but only when the situation suggests it is the most prudent course of action.  He'll attempt outlandish passes and impossible shot blocks; but allow me to suggest and believe he does it primarily for the same reason Einstein attempted to quantify the universe:

&amp;#x200B;

Because there is joy in the attempt.  And because he thought he could.

&amp;#x200B;

He scrapes, claws, and tosses subtle elbows as he goes to the basket, yet he does it coldly, without aggression.  He rarely, if ever, makes eye contact with an opponent, but it never comes off as a lack of respect.  You never seeing him talking with opponents during the game.  He doesn't smile on the court, but he plays like there's no other place he'd rather be.  He doesn't hype his game to the media.  He downplays his own abilities and emphasizes his struggles.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not by accident.  This is part of his game.  Part of his plan.

&amp;#x200B;

He's won a gold medal and three NBA championships, but he's lacking something so fundamental to the NBA, to sports, to competition in general.

&amp;#x200B;

Manu Ginobili is entirely without swagger.

&amp;#x200B;

He does not strut.  He does not preen.  He is not there to put on a show.  He does not react to hard fouls.  He does not react to being booed.  Manu Ginobili's performance may ebb and flow, reacting to his health, or to the situation, or to the quality of defender.  But from game to game, the competitiveness never changes.   Ginobili doesn't need to be pushed to achieve the paramount of his abilities, and this is why he has un(?)intentionally become a mirror that reflects the inadequacies of the NBA's world class basketball players:  deep down we all know that swagger comes hand in hand with insecurity.  We strut not to convince competitors of our dominance; we strut to convince ourselves.",nba

I am not saying that its not possible that the eyewitness statement is true, however there has been cases where rape accusations have been used for personal gain although not very common. I agree that if it is confirmed that she is a victim of course the it is evidence. However it is not confirmed that anything happened. A extremely generalized example would be a kid crying that another kid hit him. Would you believe the kid if the other kid was convinced he was innocent.

"I think the Knicks have the possibility for the biggest variance. If they swing and miss on their top targets, do they fall into the trap of over-paying some 2nd tier talents, and giving them 1st tier money for the sake of walking away with something?

There are several teams that have circled this off season on their calendar, and cleared cap space to sign 1-2 max free agents. More teams than there are going to be players available. That means that there are going to be more than a couple of GM's that overpay just to have something to show for their off-season. 

The Celtic's are right behind the Knicks as far as potentially winning or completely screwing the pooch in the off season, as we are counting on re-signing Kyrie and then making a deal for AD with the Pelicans as our big moves. 

Obv neither of those transactions are guarantees, but I can at least take some solace in knowing that Ainge (likely) won't over-correct if he misses out on Kyrie and AD by overpaying someone lesser talents, which may also mean that we don't get anything in the off-season.  ",nba

He was supposed to be Draymond with an offensive game. He could defend, run the floor, shoot 3's and grab some boards. He was the #1 pick for a reason if not easily a top 5. He was a 5 star coming out of high school and the #7 player Overall. 

It really wasnt a bad pick. Its just hard to determine if a kid wants to  work for a paycheck as oppose to relying strictly on the skills he developed growing up playing the game.

3. Vince Carter if he never got injured back in 01-02 and missed the playoffs he would’ve never gotten the hamstring injury later on and gotten traded which means this could’ve affected which pick they had gotten in 03 which means Toronto would’ve never gotten Chris Bosh (so supposedly the heat move up a draft pick) so the heat who were interested in Bosh would take him instead of Wade so this means the heat super team might have never happened.

It's what made that Houston series last year annoying it highlighted KAT's biggest weakness which is that he just sometimes thinks way too much and voluntarily basically disengages himself from the game or plays right into the opponents hands. 

 Im not kidding either when I say generational offensive talent though

a) High quality passer when he wants to be 

b) 39% career 3 pt shooter 47% from 16-22 ft historic stuff for a big really 

c) 72% career at the rim shooting. His past 3 seasons has always been above average in playtype data as a roll man


d) For his career 52.3% FG on drives. [For reference here are all the players with at least 200 drives this year](https://on.nba.com/2O0Ej1) 52.3% is like 80th percentile. 

e) Great shot creator. No matter how. 

For his career 54.3 eFG% on shots with 7 on the clock or less. You can see [for perspective here an eFG%](https://stats.nba.com/players/shots-shotclock/?Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;ShotClockRange=4-0%20Very%20Late&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=EFG_PCT&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=FGA*GE*60) amongst qualifiers this year of 54.3% late in the clock is a 95th percentile level stat as a rough guide 

For his career 1.01 PPP on post ups on 1498 poss well above average

Not Anthony Davis(shooting), not Joel Embiid(shooting), not Nikola Jokic(3 pt shooting) not Blake Griffin(not the same quality of shooter or roll man).

This failure this year is not because he can't win against amazing Western conference competition but because he missed 18 games and his team as inexplicably been losing against the worst of the worst. ",nba
"**Andre Roberson (left knee surgery) could still return this season, according to coach Billy Donovan.**

It doesn't sound likely. Roberson has yet to do any on-court work and Donovan said he wants to be optimistic, rather than abandoning the idea that Roberson could contribute this year. Maybe we'll see him at the end of the season, or in the playoffs, but either way he's not going to help fantasy owners.

But in terms what role your transitioning to, from a nobody to a solid starter is a big jump, going from a role player to borderline Star is a big jump, going from a star player to a slightly bigger star isn’t a big jump...that’s why Curry, PG and Harden would never win MIP even thought by your logic they should",nba

"No. The Bucks exposed Harden by just playing defense on his left side. You couldn't do that to Kobe. Guard him on his strong (right) side, and he'll easily take you with his left.

"If this man had the confidence, he probably could have been doing this earlier on.  Problem early on was he wouldn’t trust himself.  For example, he would often shy away from the open 3 point shot and take a few steps forward to take a long mid range shot (which he completes at a high percentage) instead.  This has stopped as of late and the reason apparently is that his teammates would fucking yell at him to just take the open 3 shot.  

He’s only 19 and so the lack of faith in his abilities is expected.  But as his confidence has developed thanks in part to the support of the vets on the team, he’s really opened it up.  It’s like he just realized this is still basketball, he’s still lethal and he just needs to do what he’s always done.  I honestly would not be surprised if he continues this hot streak to close out the season.  ",nba

PPat said he heard “like your (you’re*) used to” and when Russ says it it’s he says “like you used to” which would sound racist but you gotta realize a lot of people just replace “you’re” with “you”.

LOL.  I watched the majority of MJ's games that were available on TV and that man never fucking wandered back like a lost child on defense like Lebron does.  Lebron acts like a 10 year old who is afraid to ask a girl to dance with him on D nowadays.  He stands in an area where he hopes the ball won't come and barely makes an effort even when the offensive play with the ball rolls right on by him.  They need to cut his minutes if he can't put forth an effort on both ends of the court.  I don't give a fuck how good you are offensively if your teammates are playing 4 on 5 on the other end of the court.,nba

"In his minutes this year, he really struggled without a point guard who could see him on mismatches and open under the basket. He looked extremely raw but he showed flashes of what he could be. His 3 point shot was better than most of us thought too, which is good 

A lot of Magic fans have been down on him, but they have to understand that Mo is a project pick. He’s going to take time, but I trust our new developmental team to help him reach his potential. 

I’m a huge fan of his game and I think he has a very high ceiling. You can’t teach length. Once he bulks up and we get a PG upgrade (Fultz pls) then he’ll be much better

"Agreed on Shaq, but like I was saying, if an NBA FO decided KD wasn't the #1 pick then how is anyone supposed to pick correctly? Sure, I can say ""Ja Morant looks like a beast and will be a game changer"", and maybe that happens and I feel validated that I'm good at picking players, but I'm sure that I've thought that about other players that didn't work out(off the top of my head, Markelle Fultz I actually did think would be good), but it's easy to dismiss the misses in my picks. 

In order to feel confident in my ability to pick players, I would need to mark every player in the first round, and where I think they would pan out on draft night, and then recheck that in 5 years, and calculate my error etc. My belief is that smart FOs like Rockets/Warriors/Sixers/Hawks etc have realized that similar to 3pt percentage in NBA and college 3pt percentage, there is much less correlation than one would think about picks, and have realized going wide increases the chances of a hit.

Out of publicly available data, the easiest thing that I can point to is that outside the #1 pick, the chances of a hit between 2-10 are all like equally likely( source: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6hslaq/what_draft_picks_are_statistically_best/ ).

If it was possible that we actually could have kept him if we sent him the bigger offer initially... damn. We could’ve won a chip or two or three or four.

The more recent stuff is quite fresh in the mind, but I’d still rate that stuff below the Shaq lowball and also the rashard Lewis - Arenas trade and Vince career J rich trades... We weren’t in a great position, but those trades were true panic trades that basically meant our time as an East elite was over.

"Nah. Lebron is NOT a very good shooter.

He is shooting 34% from 3FG for his career and 35% this year. That is well below league average. His mid-range jumper hovers at about 32-34%. Which also well below average. But even worse is he is so streaky. He can go a month shooting 45% from 3 and then another month going 20%. His shot is all over the place and his bad mechanics are clearly seen with his weak free throw shooting.

Lebron is just like Giannis. You need to surround the team with shooting everywhere or they drop hard in efficiency. In contrast a guy like Curry, Harden, or KD can play with weak shooters. KD made 4 conference Finals playing with 3 horrible shooters in the starting line up (Russ, Roberson, Adams).",nba

"You’re not going to find out if booker is a ball hog unless you watch the games, stat lines won’t tell you the whole story.

His teammates pass him the ball with 2 seconds left on the shot clock multiple times a game, because they don’t really understand the fundamentals of team basketball. He has to be that guy all the time, and it tanks his percentages, makes his usage rate skyrocket, and this pretty much explains why people think he’s an inefficient ball hog. Again, if you’d watch the games, (for a lot of players on tanking teams, not just booker) you’d see how those systems ruin players stats. Each bad system hampers it’s players skills in certain way, and you will not be able to figure it out unless you’re watching, not following highlight pages on instagram, but watching. ",nba

1stly, she reported this months ago, this isnt a brand new allegation its just now coming to light

2ndly, yes??? i might?? do you realize how legitamitely devastating rape or sexual abuse is. The woman could have been shell shocked, depressed, whatever for months. She still could be. It's not easy to just wander up to the police station and be like ""hey beloved athlete with millions of fans raped me"". Even in cases in which dont involve a celebrity.. it's incredibly difficult

people like you are part of the reason why rape victims dont always come forwards. Because they are, every single time, met with people that either victim blame or flat out chose to not believe the accusation. It's a difference between letting the legal process take place, and just flat out never believing victims. People are victims of rape so much more than people lie about being raped. yet theres still this perception where, every single time a person comes forward and claims somebody raped them (especially if that somebody is famous), they're met with far more doubters than supporters. That makes it harder for victims to come forward.

Is htere a chance its fake sure. Is there a chance the charges get cleared, but he still did rape her? Yes. 

But I will literally 100% of the time hear what the victim has to say and give them some benefit of the doubt. Doesn't mean imma be out here saying Zingis for sure raped her, but I am going to empathize with her and hear her story that is tremendously difficult to tell. if shes lying thats terrible, but she deserves the same ""wElL leTs seE hOw tHe StoRY unFoLdS!!!"" as zingis",nba

"The relevance comes from Lebron's mercenary aspect of chasing sports. The hypothesis of the book is that sustained success, instead of 2-3 year runs, comes from leadership.

He also makes it clear that talent is ultimately necessary, but, again, will not sustain the run if character is not high.

He mentioned the 2000s Spurs and Barcelona as well, even in this individualistic era. Interestingly, he also highlights that because of media we've conflated talent and leadership when in the past, we understood that the two were often different. A leader's job is to bind the team. The star's job is to play and deal with the immense pressure put on them.

Sometimes they're the same but strangely this has become our default position.

So my point was that of course Lebron beat us. After all, he is simply more talented. But it is telling that his teams always have drama and never had sustained success beyond 2-3 years. ",nba
"&gt;He's been playing like ass lately.
25 points on 25 shots, 14 assists 9 rebounds. 

Is that playing like ass to you? 
Has he played poorly down the stretch?  Yeah. He has. Which is uprising since he is 34 years old and is being expected to shoulder the load on a team where is getting the most minutes while leading the team in points, assists, and rebounds.

And with regard to whether or not I enjoyed him getting his ass kicked, I'm not really phased by it one way or the other. I'm not the LeBron fan you assume I am based on your binary thinking. I've traditionally rooted against him, but I also recognize a talented player when I see one and I like to watch great basketball players play. 

But you are moving away from the debate. Why? Because you don't have a case. 

You want to say ""Kobe is better because at 34 he 'led' the Lakers to the playoffs.  The fact is that he led the short handed Lakers to a losing record (which I don't blame him for because they were down a few guys; and I don't blame LeBron for the Lakers current record because they are not only down a few guys, but he is the ONLY player on the team in the plus). 

Kobe and the Lakers didn't get back over .500 until Kobe had Artest, and Howard, and Gasol and Nash to play with.  Which, I'm sure you can agree, is a SIGNIFICANTLY better roster than what LeBron is playing with right now.  

Neither was Kobe expected to lead the team in rebounds and assists, like LeBron currently is. 

Also... Kobe played 78 games that season, so he had more of an opportunity to help the team. That is a quantifiable fact.

As mention, LeBron's  current season is more comparable to Kobe's season in 04/05, when both only played around 2/3 of the season and both had comparable rosters (and both players saw a big shift in personal from the season they played prior).

But for some reason you just don't want to admit that. You have this ""Kobe is better than LeBron and anybody who disagrees with a LeBron nut hugger"" attitude, and that is because you are clear a Kobphile... which is fine. Kobe was one of the best and there is good reason to be a fan of him. 


But let's compare apples to apples. Yeah? And if you get desperate and want to point to a single game to support your flawed reasoning, you can go ahead and do that, but just know that's a bit silly.


Guys who are 34 years old and still able to put up a night like 25/14/9 (even it is with a low FG% and 8 turnovers) is not playing like 'ass'. That is fucking amazing!

"&gt; I don't think Tatum scores like Melo, but he is absolutely a scorer and he wouldn't be a role player on any other team

I feel like Celtics fans have this bizarre talking point about Tatum, that he's a scorer. If he's a scorer, why doesn't he score? You think he's a scorer cause in a photograph he looks like he *should* be a scorer, but when he's in the actual games he's not doing it. I see this constantly from Celtics fans around here: ""Tatum is a scorer, he just doesn't score."" ""The Celtics are a good team, they just don't play good."" You can't just *be* something without doing any of the things that go along with what it takes to be that thing.

Also, I submit that Tatum *isn't* a role player on the Celtics, because even though he's not even putting up 16 ppg he's still their #2 option on offense. You say he wouldn't be a role player for any other team, but I think part of why the Celtics have been so underwhelming this season is specifically *because* Tatum is such a mediocre 2nd option player. Go look at any other playoff team in either conference and almost all of them have better 2nd option players. I mean, Tatum scores like Rudy Gobert and Pascal Siakam, but he sure doesn't defend like those guys do. 

So maybe Tatum is *playing* like a role player on the Celtics this year, even though they're featuring him, but the reality is that I don't think Tatum would be featured this much if he was on almost any other playoff team, not if he was playing like this. And instead of being featured this much he probably would be in much more of a role player kind of role for most of those other teams. He'd probably be in a bigger role on a team at the bottom of the league, as that team tried to force him into the kind of role of a player they could build around, but would that team be any good? I doubt it.",nba

He isn’t even a focal point of the Cavs and he is still doing that. He is also becoming a better playmaker too.

&gt; Giannis faced basically zero adversity in the East. He has an entire team built around his weakness. Hell their Center is one of their best shooters. Giannis is basically playing 4 corners offense and barging into the lane hoping the refs won't call him for offensive fouls.

"This ""sub"" if we're going to generalize, has shat on Tatum all season. I've seen so many posts of ""Ingram &gt; Tatum"" where the proof is literally citing shooting slashes. The problem is that Tatum thrived in the postseason as the #1 scoring option and he's been relegated to a different role with Kyrie back. Meanwhile, the Lakers struggled with and without LeBron even with Ingram putting up better shooting slashes in the 2nd half. 

So the question of ""who is better"" will only be answered in the coming seasons, especially if Kyrie leaves. Then we'll know if the postseason was largely a fluke or not. Even then, these are 2 young players, both might develop at different rates based on other factors (ie D'Angelo Russell, Victor Oladipo). The question of why do GMs/scouts view Tatum more favorably? How many rookies have you seen do what Tatum did in the playoffs last season. It's why I thought the many who moved off of Mitchell early this season were crazy. ",nba

I know I’ve been blown away by watching Gasol’s passing (who is averaging similar assist numbers to Vucevic) on the raptors it really helps to connect the team together when your primary pick setter can also be such a good passer. 

Apart from that hopefully SGA can continue to improving on the playmaking front. He’s never going to be another Chris Paul, you’ve definitely been extremely spoiled in that sense but I also don’t think anyone in the league right now is as good a playmaker as Chris Paul was in his prime.

Literally because he can't. He's not a great midrange shooter or 3pt shooter and for him to 'take over' would require him to put significant physical effort into the game as me gets most of his points in the paint. This takes a lot of work and he'd just burn out early. 

The faults in his game are starting to show. Over the regular span of the game, since he's so ball dominant he'll get his 27+ points and ~8 assists, very physical and strong at 6'8 so you know he'll get ~8 rebounds but... he can't take over games like some of the greats and past hall of fame players.

"The Jazz game comes in mind where he was left until the end despite a comfortable lead. He was stuck at 28 pts for quite some time and it seemed as if his coach left him a bit more than necessary. I have no issue with such behavior BTW. In some bucks games I have seen something similar with Giannis. Coach brings him in much more than how he used to (doesn't rest him in the 4th) all because he wants to help his boy to stat pad. So none of the two is innocent of this. All I am saying is that streaks are not necessarily the best indicators in this day and age. General performance is a better one.

Yes, it makes a difference. When post players are also the primary passers it opens up the game so much more than when a perimeter player is. They cause the defense to collapse on them and open up perimeter shooting. Most/all shooters around Giannis are having careers years percentage wise because of that very fact.

Some players and teams are more exciting to watch than others, regardless of which is the strictly speaking better. Harden is an absolute master of offense, but so is Steph and his playstyle is way more visually appealing.

The Rockets when they flip that pace switch and are on point are really fun to watch, but for the rest of the time they have the third slowest pace in the NBA with more than double the ISO possessions of the 2nd most ISO heavy team. Harden alone has more than 1.5x the ISO possessions per game as the 2nd place team. Is is really fucking impressive that he can do that? Yeah, it's insane.

There are so many plays where he literally ambles towards his man, doesn’t help on the drive, watches a shot, doesn’t box out. When he plays Center, it’s rare that he will even pretend to be a rim protector - he’ll watch from the weakside as a player drives at the basket.

It’s not that he’s a bad defender (although he does make plenty of bad defensive plays), it’s that he plays with zero intensity.

I just want to say this is the first year of my life where I have actually enjoyed watching basketball. A friend has gotten me into watching and I’ve been enjoying it a lot. I now have been really getting why this is a crazy sport.

That being said; JESUS CHRIST! That happened so fast I had to watch it 6 times to remotely understand how. I don’t have any way to rationalize this other than being a career breaker which fucking hurts to see. ",nba

"For exactly the same reasons LeBron went to the Lakers last year. 

KD has been trying to follow LeBron's career path, going to Golden State was a very similar move to LeBron going to Miami, they were both basketball decisions to get rings. 

KD is trying to combine the best parts of LeBron's move to Cleveland (winning a title for a starved franchise) and LeBron's move to LA (playing at iconic MSG, the Knicks as a brand, busine$$$) into one move to NY. 

KD doesn't really have a fanbase that's firmly behind him. Everybody respects him as a player and his greatness on the court, but nobody worships him, because he left the Thunder and the Warriors are Steph's team. ",nba

"So your argument is essentially that the Lakers don't need to make the playoffs and shouldn't care about missing them or? Unless a team is intentionally tanking for a high draft pick (the Lakers are not), they have an obligation to succeed as much as they're able, especially with a player of Lebron's caliber on the team. You don't see the Jazz or Portland not caring about wins just because they aren't realistic championship contenders. The Lakers still had high expectations at the beginning of the season. They were generally seen as a top five seed by most people. Missing the playoffs is an abject failure from the whole organization no matter how you look at it. 

The bottom line is that Lebron is not willing his team to wins in the way that is expected of the player regarded as the greatest in the world. It's not entirely his fault, but he is not doing everything he can. ",nba

They just have no depth. Even fully healthy they were *starting* James Ennis to begin the year.

I don’t get how anyone can watch us play, with or without Giannis, and not see a massive carry job. You can argue about which is more impressive and I’m not even saying you’re wrong for picking Harden as MVP but this is a team with one other All Star, who is *barely* an All Star, and we’re still having a legit all-time season.

&gt;Wade was washed by year 2. 

22/5/5 is not washed..

&gt;Bosh underperformed

So did Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman in the 98 finals. But that doesn't fit your dumb narrative 

&gt;Ray Allen was old

Still an elite 3 point shooter who could spread the floor and was a great 6th man..


&gt;Battier was a bench player. He was a key bench player, but he was not guarding the best player half the time. LeBron didn’t have a Pippen to lessen his load to bully undersized 2 guards like John Starks. 

He started in games where Spoelstra decided to go small ball. He also started in some playoff games. He was a great wing defender who did take main assignments lol. Did you watch those Heat teams?



&gt;Shut down Derrick Rose at the peak of his powers.

Derrick blew by him but ran into the Heat help defense. Rose had no other scoring option and wasn't a good shooter. That's what happens when you're a primary scorer with no legit 2nd option on a defensive minded team

&gt;Literally guarded the 1-5 in Miami. 

That ""1-5"" is a myth. Explain LeBron getting ate up by David West in the ECF? The Pacers literally considered him an exploit in the conference finals and made sure Roy Hibbert or David West post up on him.

&gt;You’re taking legitimate nonsense.

You didn't watch LeBron in 2013 and you're repeating what every casual claims prime LeBron did lol..

&gt; LeBron would put his hand on every players lower back and they would not be able to do a thing about it Jordan included. 265, bigger stronger and faster than every win ever. LeBron with a handcheck is a bully. Physics wins. 

Isn't a good iso defender, he was a great help defender. Like I said, watch games instead of repeating casual shit.


&gt;Jordan had a more significant size and athletic advantage over  “elite defender “ he faced than LeBron. Jordan never faced a wing that defended well as Kawhi, PG or Draymond. 

Joe Dumars? 2 time DPOY Sidney Moncrief? DPOY Gary Payton? Don't talk shit about legends if you don't shit about history.


&gt;So size and strength don’t matter in an era where you can be more physical? Watch more basketball

As for the topic at hand

1) The best way to know the statistical performance of a player is to run a sort of metastudy. In the case of basketball to watch who tops many if not most of the advanced statistics. In this analog an advanced statistic is ""a study"" and their averaging"" is a ""metastudy"" this is a standard practice in science and works remarkably well.

2) If you do that you get two performers. Giannis Antetokounmpo and James Harden that are quite far from the rest of the pack.

3) If you do that in any other year too you are going to find 1-3 people in that category. In all the years that you can run this ""metastudy"" that belongs to the modern NBA (I.e. post 1979, after the merger, the 3pt line and in particular the drafting of Bird and Magic) you are going to find that the guy that belongs to said exclusive club *and* is the first seed wins it 100% of the time.

Now you don't have to believe me, you only have to run this ""metastudy"" yourself. So instead of wasting my time and yours by writing here, go, do and accept that your boy is going against a 40+ year tradition.

Now if you think that he will win all the more power to you. I kinda doubt it, that is the only point that I meant to meaningfully make in this topic. I won't let you (again) to stray me off topic.

"I didn't watch the finals last year because I knew Lebron and that Cavs team had no chance in hell.  Blame the drop in finals viewership on no team being able to push the Warriors, not on Lebron missing.  I watched the WCF between the Rockets and Warriors because I knew it would be competitive.

"Probably 4ish less... the East has been tanking for a \*while\* now, with stellar non-performances by Chicago, Cleveland, and the Knicks. In the West only the Suns are that level of trash. Each game they'd probably still be the favorites because they're just that good, but I think that the main difference would be in how they spread minutes due to the increased difficulty of the grind. 4 games against Sacramento, Lakers, Memphis, and Suns (a 4 game road trip vs. 9th, 11th, 13th, and 15th in the West) vs. 4 games against Orlando, Washington, Bulls, and Knicks (the same only in the East) just seems a lot rougher (not on Giannis, the guy is at least 25% Abrams, but on the mere mortals around him) physically.

&amp;#x200B;

The difference between the conferences isn't only in the trash. The Celtics and Spurs have the same record, but the Spurs are the 8th seed in the West (and scheduled for a first round against the god damn Warriors) while the Celtics are the 5th seed (against the Pacers) at the moment. And if you've watched the Spurs play even a bit in the past couple of weeks, they're playing better. That being said, the Bucks are really good, and they'd probably be ahead of the Warriors who might also drop a game or two extra because of that... but it would probably put the Raptors at #1.",nba

"As someone who grew up in NZ, do you guys consider people from other countries ""bandwagoners?""

Our main sport is rugby, but I didn't pay much attention to it, or any sports in general.

Then the current era of the warriors came, and it's what got me into NBA

&amp;#x200B;

I had heard of the legendary jordan when I was young. And he was pretty much all I knew about NBA.

Fast forward to 2015, my friend was showing my highlights on youtube. namely steph curry, who was very impressive. so I loosely kept up with the team though highlights... then they won :O

Started paying way more attention to them in the 73 win season, it was just amazing to see the winning steaks. They made it to the finals, had a tough but exciting series against OKC. Then lost to lebron. I didn't know much about him at the time, but that made me legitimately mad/sad. Such a tough loss.   
Then KD joined them. Such a rollercoaster of emotions. 

And yeah, been constantly watching them ever since. And I've become a fan of the NBA as a whole.   
I know most of the good players from all the teams. I sports-hate the rockets because they almost gave me a heart attack. 

Greek freak, Fox, Dame, PG 7 Joicik  are some of my favourite non-gsw players. I especially love the warriors, and almost feel bad for other teams for how good they can be....   
but I'm happy I got into NBA in just the right time to see one of the best basketball team assembled.   
Even though it's cliche, but I assume this is what jordan fans would've felt like. 

I finally see the appeal of sports. The losses feel painful, but the wins satisfying. 

&amp;#x200B;",nba
"Not sure how well known Jake Layman is to the public outside of some cool highlight dunks.  He went from ""why are you in the NBA?"" last year to a solid bench contributor for us the last couple months.

He has been in a slump that last couple weeks... hoping the slump is the fluke and not his play the months prior to this.",nba
"Plus you know, KD's famous rant at that one dude on his quiresultan burner, plus a bunch of tweets clapping back at various fans saying things like 'you gotta be a piece of shit if your dog rather be on the streets than in your home' because someone joked about their dog pulling a KD.

Nobody is a saint, and I get that throwing some shit doesn't necessarily means he deserves what he gets, but I'll perhaps save my pity for those in more need, while giving him all my empathy for this tragic loss.",nba
"40 straight finals, because that means you also play good basketbal which you can enjoy. I mean you would never know you lose the finals, so the journey each year would be incredible. Also if I look at the bottoms now at watch their game... I really don't want to watch the Suns or Cleveland for 39 years because one championship",nba
"I would be inclined to agree with you. The Warriors have the benefit of having good passers at almost every position. So having Lebron would obviously improve on that aspect, but maybe not have a large net effect. 

The warriors really struggle with mid-range scoring without KD. Klay is second best, but not in ISO like KD is, which is why KD is very important to the Warriors. I also think this is where the biggest impact that Lebron would have. Passing out of the post and scoring high/low post I would assume would be his bread and butter. The thing with that is, KD and Boogie have that aspect of the game down pretty good, and KD has improved his passing out of there. So again, not sure if Lebron would make the team 'better'

The biggest question mark is really the defensive abilities. When KD is on his game, he's freaking good at defense. Lebron hasn't shown his ability/effort in that area in recent years, which obviously doesn't mean he's not capable. As a continuation of this, the Warriors are best when they are constantly moving and screening off ball, and I don't see Lebron being capable of exerting that much energy at this point in his career.  

That being said my only exposure to Lebron's recent play has been watching him when he plays the Warriors, which has pretty much been in the Finals. ",nba
"Hey I can admit my Wolves are up there with them. Not quite at that level though.

And I disagree he would not have blossomed. Harden had all the tenets of a great player, he was just young like a lot of great players at some point. I'm not saying he would have been as great as now, but you can't act like the dude was regressing in OKC lol.",nba
And his teams have been winning for a long time... which really gives credibility to the fact that it's not his fault.  Magic putting him with a toon squad with no 3 and D guys is why the team is failing.  Lebron is a GOAT candidate but that doesnt mean he can do literally everything.  There are 5 dudes out there at a time.,nba
"He should've told the team in PRIVATE, which would have given the Pels a heads up and time to develop a strategy, then announce it publicly at the end of the season.

It's fine that he wants to leave -- who can blame him? -- but the way it was handled was a complete clusterf\*ck.",nba
"He needs an elite traditional PG to play alongside with.  Rondo was the closest he's ever had, and look what happened.  By far their best postseason run.  Now imagine him with CP3 or even the White/Murray/Mills combo in SA (I think he would be Tim Duncan reincarnated if he replaced Aldridge in SA, personally).  AD is also just kind of a weird player to build around, in general.  He has displayed really good passing instincts throughout his career, I actually think his arms are physically just too long for him to ever be an elite passer/playmaker, though.  He needs to use those arms to grab lobs, dunk over people, and develop an elite skyhook/fadeaway repertoire.  Perfect for a second-tier trad point guard to pass to, imo.   ",nba

Timing is impeccable, though, and it was obviously not an accident by Chriss.",nba
"That's an even better thing for the nuggs then. Looney is too small and so is bell, jokic will bully them for sure. The bogut trade though I think was to basically get a big dude to lay on someone's center for a solid 10 mins a game and box out, basically just be a big immovable rock. 

He also would be expected to do the exact same thing on offense, set a hard screen, shoot a close to mid-range shot or pass the ball to the open man. The warriors basically just need him to be a literal brick wall in peoples way and that's it, the only running he is probably gonna do is a jog to get back on defense. 

His injury history is obviously a concern, but he did play almost 30 mins a game in Australia so I think he can probably take the amount of strain the Warriors will put on him. I imagine he will do something like 4/5/2 with maybe .5-1 block in about 10-15 mins a game once the playoffs begin, they will probably barely even play him before the postseason to try and let him get some rest after just coming off  the fairly short Australian season.

"Honestly, I’d take him back for a year plus a team option at a vet minimum in a heartbeat. He had a really nice stretch with us through the first half of the year and his locker room presence and attitude was valuable to our young guys.

"If he gets maxed we won’t, but nobody’s that dumb. It depends, if we want to roll it back next year (so, as long as we don’t collapse in the playoffs) we’ll be going into the tax. From there it’s a matter of how far into the tax we want to go. Middleton, Brogdon, Lopez and Mirotic are all FAs at the end of the season and we don’t have Lopez’s bird rights, so for him it’s just a matter of whether or not he’s willing to take whatever MLE we can give him. I’d be very surprised if Middleton didn’t come back, so there’s 25-30m/year probably. I don’t see us choosing Mirotic over Brogdon if we don’t want to pay that much tax, so from there it’s a matter of matching contracts.

That’s even assuming he’d sign an offer sheet from a team like Phoenix, I don’t really know if money’s a big priority for him. I would kinda like to see him on a lesser team with increased volume if he does leave, I think he could be a 20-5-5 type of guy without so many scorers on his team like he has now. Don’t know if he’s the type you really want to look at though, he’s best played at the 2 because he can guard PGs alright but he lacks the lateral speed to give most of them any real trouble, and he is a good passer/playmaker for his position but he’s not really somebody I think can properly run a great offence. Maybe if he and Booker split duties it could go alright but the fit isn’t amazing.

At 13 u can be charged as an adult.. like I said it’s gross but u don’t know the exact circumstances.. and as well my grandmother had her first baby at 15 and that was perfectly normal .. so should my grandpa be sent to jail for rape considering he was 17 at the time ?? ,nba

As far as Sterling Brown, he definitely shouldnt have been tazed, but if anyone remembers, he escalated the situation by trying to get into his car when the police officer was asking him why he parked the way he did.

I’m sorry you can’t understand my arguments man.

What future asset did they give up? The 8th pick in the draft and two players who got traded again ASAP? Oh ok. Stupid Celtics 





&gt;Your argument, verbatim, is ""they didn't expect him to leave when they made that trade"". Are you fucking kidding me? If they are wrong, which it seems fair to say is more likely then not, you conceded that hes had meltdowns thrice this year(doesnt sound like someone who in happy with their situation), then the trade doesnt make sense. Your own arguments say as much. 

Are you brain dead? My argument as clear as possible has been, how is the trade not good when the only reason you have is based on an what if scenario. “IF KYRIE LEAVES”. That’s my argument, don’t know how I can make it any clearer than that. 



&gt;As for what they gave up to get him, I will repeat for the third fucking time: Id rather have Sexton than nothing. 

Well you don’t have “nothing you still have Marcus Smart and Terry Rozier, even with roziers struggles he’s still better than Sexton, plus they are pretty similar players.


&gt;Id rather have higher respect in NBA circles by not doing IT dirty(in the minds of some, its just business in my eyes but thats not the case for all NBA players) than have nothing. 

So you’d rather have the player who’s injury ruined his career and will never play the same again over the all nba point guard who just hit his prime, to cater to NBA circles, over Rozier and smart? Because again, it isn’t “nothing” it’s pretty disingenuous to keep saying “nothing” when you still have 3 serviceable PG’s on the roster

"Budenholzer is a Pop disciple so it makes sense he has the same strategy. And he certainly has the personnel for it.

I'm not really trying to ignite a Curry vs. Harden debate but one key difference in the effectiveness of this defense is Curry's elite off ball ability. While there are obviously other things defenses can do to slow down his off ball effectiveness, this defensive strategy is not one of them. It makes it easier for Curry to counter this defense than Harden.

Another feature of this defense is picking the player up full court. I didn't see the game so I don't know if the Bucks did this at all. You might not always do it with your starters as it is tiring, but you can certainly do it with your backups. Pop used to have Cory Joseph hound Curry full court the entire time he was in, to keep him uncomfortable and try to wear him down.",nba

It really feels that people think Beal is a good defender because he **was**.  Not is, but was.  This year with his increased load due to missing John Wall, his defense has weakened immensely and by DRTG he's the worst starting defensive guard on the team.  Beal is doing pretty solid working on a similar load to what Booker has always had.  He still got toasted last night by Book though and his team barely squeaked out a victory over a team that gave Booker his Starting Teammates of 3 Rookies and Dragan Bender lol...

"Because he’s so good at generating open looks with off-ball movement. Harden doesn’t really do off-ball movement so all his shots require him to break down a defender, which will automatically lead to tougher looks, whereas Curry can get an open shot anywhere on the floor (I mean ANYWHERE) by using screens and just constantly moving, so you get more open looks because it’s harder to defend off ball against somebody like Curry. Harden meanwhile is probably a better tough shot maker so he doesn’t need to do all this offball movement. Also with offball play, your relying more on your teammates success than Harden is, so your naturally going to get less shots. This isn’t saying Curry is bad on ball, he’s obviously fantastic off the dribble, but he doesn’t do it anywhere near as much as Harden.",nba

That's why the NBA never plays with brand new Balls, every Ball needs lots of practice time, before it should be used in official games.

Y’all gonna downvote me but will worship Tatum but the minute Ingram does a pull up midrange shot like Tatum, he’s trash. Don’t base your opinions on what r/nba says. Trae was supposed to be a bust here and Donovan Mitchell was a chucker lmao ",nba
"Or, all of those seasons are historic in some way or another. That’s why all those guys won MVP. When you’re looking at six different stats, as you apparently want to do, chances are the best player (or couple of players) in any given year will have a unique combination of them. Unless you’re using the term “historic” to mean “literally the best box score of all time”, I don’t really see why Kevin Durant having historic volume and efficiency in 2014 precludes Giannis from having a completely different type of historic stat line five years later.

But hey, if we’re talking about “relevant stats” like there’s some list of box score numbers from worst to best, let’s talk about minutes per game. That seems pretty relevant, right? Maybe even the most relevant, the more minutes you play the more all of your other stats except TS% are going to go up. Wonder who’s matching up to Giannis there.",nba

But what I gather from the youtubers I watch and the way the anthony davis ordeal went and the way the team is built, it was definitely a condition of lebron signing that the lakers were going to spend all of their roster like currency to get the team lebron wants.

2. Mitchell - west play off caliber team as the number one option while providing good defense.

4. Booker - the game is about getting buckets and he does it, very difficult to rank him above the other two.

5. Doncic - I think he has the highest ceiling and will be the best player out of the bunch in his prime, just relatively young right now. The fact that’s he in this conversation and honestly I would respect anyone putting him below jrue and holiday gives enough perspective.

Normally a scheduled loss is on a 3 in 4 night away stand, or a 4 in 5 w/ two back-to-backs and a day in between (not even sure this is a thing anymore), which is why I had pointed out that there was a home game, a day off, a home game, and an away game.

He didn't join a team that was already historically great.

"With how the situation played out I'm glad we don't have Butler, that's not really that delusional. There was talk of keeping him for the season and trading him at the deadline, and that's what I'm happy did not happen. I can be mad at Jimmy Butler if I want to as well. He went about getting traded in the worst possible way, and was a complete dick on his way out (waving his towel with Golden State fans during a loss/that interview he set up with ESPN). He's good at basketball, yes, but I'm happy we didn't have to watch him for more than a few games. That's also not the deal that happened, so there's no point in hypothesizing. If we'd gotten LeBron for Andrew Wiggins we could be a potential contender too, but that didn't happen either. Glen Taylor screwed us over with Wiggins' contract, and Thibodeau, while we did make the playoffs from his trade, screwed us over by getting rid of a young core for nothing. We're absolutely fucked until Wiggins is gone because of his and Gorgui Deng's contract, so forgive me for not wanting to watch Jimmy Butler make the team even more toxic like he was doing while he was still here. Also, since I seemed to miss the point of your comment, it's probably still reasonable to be upset with Andrew Wiggins too. He got supermaxed and then seemingly stopped caring about basketball. He's consistently a negative on the floor in his effort, his defense, his shot selection (good gracious the number of bricked long two pointers) and by actually being a negative +/-. There's no reason to support a guy who doesn't care and is getting paid the largest possible amount of money to do it.",nba

"He's been as good as PG imo. Look at their stats and per 100 there isn't a huge amount of separation in pretty much any stat. PG has more assists, Kawhi scores more. The rest of their stats are very similar. PG has had a better season defensively no doubt but it's not like Kawhi hasn't also been very good. Kawhi is also even more efficient than PG.

I would also put Kawhi over AD for sure. AD was coasting hard this year and after the trade deadline he only plays like 25 min a night. And the amazing thing is that Kawhi was coasting and *still* being this impactful.",nba
"I think the post game is still there but it has also evolved into something a bit different from what it’s been in the past. I feel like on a game to game basis KAT gets plenty of touches in the post, but a lot of teams have moved into a moving post off of different kinds of screen actions. Like you notice a lot of pnr’s that turn into post situations now than before. I know the wolves love to get Towns moving into post position and just going to work instead of having him weight and have people clear out. I know the Sixers run a lot of stuff like that for Embiid as well and I wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of these teams with really offensively talented big men did some similar stuff.",nba

They should and hopefully will take RJ Barrett. I have no idea how a lot of people have started just putting him behind Morant all of a sudden. Ja is good very good but he is a sophomore doing this.

He gets his assists in an offense that is more than one player just running constant high PnR/iso.  Harder to get high assist numbers in a democratic offense.

I will say, I don't care too much who wins MVP.  Harden plays many more minutes and has a far bigger offensive creation load.

Look at :31 of your video. We see Bledsoe shading his left side and not really fighting through the screen, allowing Harden to go inside.

Look at :57 of your video. We see Bledsoe shading his left side and not even paying attention to anything else.

Look at 1:45 of your video. Hill noticeably defends Harden's left side and does not offer any resistance to his movement towards the paint. 

Look at 3:24 of your video. Snell offers no resistance to Harden's drive.

Look at 3:30 of your video. Bledsoe shades his left and offers no resistance to him.

Look at 3:45 of your video. Hill shades his left the entire time. 

Look at 4:55 of your video. Hill shades his left the entire time.

Look at 5:58 of your video. Bledsoe is literally on Harden's left so much he'd have to reach across Harden to touch his right side. You can hear the announcer say ""here's Bledsoe again, sitting on Harden's left hand.""

Look at 6:06 of your video. Brogdon shading Harden's left side and allowing him an easy path to drive. 

Look at 6:48 of your video. Hill is firmly planted on Harden's left side. 

Look at 8:14 of your video. Brogdon's shading Harden's left so he passes to the opposite side of the court. If he had tried to pass to the left side, the ball would've bounced off Brogdon. Because Brogdon was shading his left.

Look at 8:30 of your video. Giannis shades Harden's left, and even when he gets back in position to defend, he still shades Harden's left side.

I'm white, so I obviously can't speak to how emotionally provocative those comments are to a black person, nor can I say how I would react if I were in that situation, but I do think there are right and wrong ways to handle that anger. Not sure how I feel about Russ's reaction, because on the one hand, I'm not sure how many people actually think Russ would have gone into the stands to assault the guy and his wife, but on the other hand, physical threats are physical threats.

I’m a girl who was never into sports but basketball was something I could watch and get engaged in if my dad was watching a game on tv. One night he was watching a Warriors game and I saw Curry shoot an incredible 3 point shot.

Four year later and I’m not just a Warriors fan but a legit basketball fan who follows the analysis and standings of both conferences. ,nba

"It's a good thing we don't need hypotheticals then, because Giannis has done less with the same talent/coaching level as Harden had, all while in an easier conference. 0 top 4 seeds, 0 1st round wins. 

&gt;A perfect example is the 2015-2016 rockets. You complained about Hardens injury on his teams the previous year..but when he had an all healthy team the following year ( a healthy Dwight playing 70+ games) that team won a paltry 41 games.

OK? And where did I say he deserved MVP that year? Keep moving them goalposts. So you lost the 15 Rockets v 19 Bucks argument, now you want to move on to 16 and 17? Nice try.

Harden. Their supporting casts were near equal overall and they played in the same conference, making an easy 1 to 1 evaluation. Unlike 19 Bucks vs 15 Rockets. +10 wins easily beats out +2 rebounds. But, record/stats/narrative overall still point to Kawhi over either.

Although the fact that injury is why nobody is judging LeBron for this fail is ironic because most of LeBron's claim to greatness revolves around him being an ironman, putting up longevity stats, and never having to recover from athleticism sapping injuries. That extremely rare health is a big part of what has raised him above a lot of other stars and now that it's faltered the lack of it is being used to prop him up.",nba

"I agree that people are unfair towards him often, I mean, you will see him getting fouled and going to the line and people will be mad about it. It's just prejudice against him after a point and I understand how annoying it can be, and also how hard it is for him to escape that reputation.

Yes, many people on that list do more than one thing. I think the main factor that makes people hate Harden more is that he is in the MVP conversation every year - so in a sense, he is more ""relevant"" than others during the regular season - don't forget that most of the other players are either old or just not as good as Harden, so they don't get much attention.

I mean, people surely hate Olynyk and Beverley more than Harden, but who the fuck cares about Olynyk, he is irrelevant. Manu used to be hated just as much, LBJ always had stans and haters too, but he happens to be the 2nd best player ever so he gets a pass for most of his shit. I mean, if you ask me, I dislike LBJ more than Harden - LeBron is throwing his team under the bus repeatedly, gets crazy calls too, flops, complains non-stop to the refs, acts like a crybaby. But it's mostly a trend. Like, Harden is currently the villain. Again, it isn't personal. I assure you, if Harden stops foul hunting / flopping, people will slowly stop hating.

The beef with other fanbases (GSW, Lakers, OKC, Bucks) because of either playoff series or MVP arguments etc. doesn't help Harden be likeable here either.

Also, keep in mind that you are talking to a Bucks fan - we beat the Lakers yesterday and the front page was full of Lakers' highlights and threads. Nobody gives a shit about us. Mainstream media still say the Raptors and Celtics are the teams to beat in the East. Every fanbase has its ""issues"" with r/NBA or journalists.",nba

You think that if Middleton and Bledsoe and Lopez get injured today and miss the rest of the season and Bucks finish 2nd, it's gonna matter? Giannis will not win MVP if the Bucks finish 2nd or 3rd overall even if the whole squad gets injured.

"Klay is a much better defender.

With regard to playmaking, I'm inclined to frame them as equals, or near equals.  Allen had a couple of opprotunities where he could make plays, but Klay has been playing with alongside Curry and Draymond.  The system Klay plays him requires him to pass and move the ball, which he does well and with limited turnovers, but the stats do show that  Allen has an edge there. 

The question is about being able to create off the ball.  Klay has been better from beyond the arc from the get go, so the Warriors have pushed that skill set, but he does have other offensive tools.  

The issue is that it's hard to compare him with Allen. Allen played in the league when SGs were still expected to create off teh dribble a lot, and as the primary option with the Sonics and Bucks, he had to do that. But when he went to Boston, we quickly saw how much more effective he was when he took on a roll like the way Klay is in right now.

"I wonder how much voters care about how liked/popular a player is and their importance to the league.

That is the only valid argument against Harden. People understandably hate the way he plays. If you want me to elaborate I will, but for now, I'll just leave it at that.

The All Star voting showed how unpopular Harden is amongst fans and players. For the incredible, all time great season Harden is having, his all star vote numbers were really low. He was picked next to last (just ahead of Oledipo) by the All Star captains. And based on a Brian Windhorst report during the all star break, the young NBA players don't like Harden very much (because of his game).

You can argue that this shouldn't mean anything, and maybe you are right. But Giannis is better for the NBA. Harden's numbers and him carrying a sinking team (when they were sinking) should get him the MVP. But if I had a vote because I worked in the industry and understood the league MVP directly influences my industry and job, I would def not vote for Harden.

I can't stand watching harden dribble in place and then launch a 3 with 4 seconds left in the shot clock. I don't care how many he makes its fucking boring. Watching Steph throughout a possession and he runs himself open off ball is amazing to me. He repositions, gets himself open, finds his spots and launches. I'm not trying to talk you into it, I just can't fathom how Harden's flopping and one man game is entertaining.

Warriors had more talent and 'strength in numbers'.  

Kerr did a horrible coaching job in Game 1- Game 4.

It was obvious he should have attacked Kanter/Morrow on defense. Instead he was satisfied with running his motion offense and not isolating against Kanter/Morrow to force them out of the game.

Kerr survived the OKC series.  But he burnt out his team in the process and they were easy prey if Cleveland could extend the series. And Adam Silver did just that.

If Kerr attacks Kanter/Morrow from Game1 the Warriors win in 5 and have enough juice to beat the Cavs in the Finals.

* Getting a 6th man

* Filling out the deep end of the bench (this piece i'm less worried about because we have 3 prospects that I really like in Shake Milton, Zhaire Smith, and Jonah Bolden though Bolden i think may be limited in the long run).

"Yes, I'm talking about gerrymandering which, as you noted, isn't always illegal or unconstitutional. In this case, however, it was ruled unconstitutional, and as part of the investigation, there were emails revealed that made it very clear what the intent was: to effectively disenfranchise black voters. Perhaps if they'd JUST ""accidentally"" drawn the districts in a way that gave the minority population (Republicans) more seats/representation in the legislature, they might have gotten away with it... however, that's not all they did. They also closed down polling stations in black areas, and they did it on purpose (again, emails revealed this). 

Gerrymandering can be a good thing. If you've got a sizable minority population concentrated in an area, then it makes sense to try and get that population their own representation by drawing a district around them.

I mean this is in the most objective way possible - you are one of the dumbest people on this sub and if this is how you think about fandom and basketball, I’m truly sorry for you.

Your entire bit is I’m a troll for making a crack about Westbrook, but you literally are still making KD snake jokes. Everyone on here is an idiot in some ways - but this is a special type of stupidity.

I also think it's gotta play into the minds of whichever team they are playing against when KD isn't playing. Not to say I think you guys will lose (I think you win) but I think the Rockets thought the game was easy money and the warriors had a 10 point lead pretty quick from that. Slow start for the Rockets isn't good with how they have been playing (quick leads in games). ,nba

They should have worked him in slowly and let Tatum and brown get those starter minutes early. That would have eased the pressure on him and allowed him to spend more time working on getting comfortable with that ankle. I know this is with the benefit of hindsight, but I heard Jay Williams say this and I thought it was a point. 

As a fan of this team it’s starting to get difficult to stay patient with him and the team at the moment. But I’m holding off any long term judgements for Gordon until we see him next season with a full offseason under his belt to build that confidence back up.

Would you prefer it if he doesn't say where he plans to go in FA so that a team can trade a lot of assets for him and then get fucked when he leaves as a FA ?

If anything, he did NOL a solid by telling them so early he won't re-sign once he's a FA, so NOL can trade him to a team that wants to take a flyer and try to convince AD to stay in their team (like OKC and Torronto have done).",nba
"Totally agree. This is symptomatic of broader issues with the hiring process in a lot of professional fields imo. It seems like experience and the ability to do the job rank dead last amongst candidates' most sought-after attributes, behind their paper qualifications, past achievements which may or may not be relevant to the job at hand, social/public standing, familiarity to the organization, and being somebody's child. And it seems like every time some shortsighted exec tries to make the  process more ""holistic,"" they just tack on even more bullshit.

Sports management is particularly bad because the FOs actually skip the paper qualifications and go straight to the irrelevant past achievements. I'm sure a lot of this has to do with placating the fans by bringing in a recognized name, but the payoff (or lack thereof) surely isn't worth it.",nba

"You're being extremely disingenuous. Sophmore players single handedly turning a team from medicore to a 50+ win team as shown from Embiid's recent absence is more than a ""promising"" core. He's a generational talent. Ben Simmons has that type of potential as well.

Dlo, randle, lonzo, kuzma, and ingram never even got to play a single year together. Although despite being a year younger last year and having no reason to tank having traded their pick and without dlo who is continuing to improve, they won 35 games in the west. Instead of going for Lebron and another FA, had they kept dlo and Randle and tanked one more year and then signed someone like a Kyrie, KD, or Kawhi, they'd be younger and would actually have a realistic window at a title.

Every report says that no major free agent wants to go to the lakers. Particularly the players that would have a chance at making the lakers relevant (KD and Kawhi). And for good reason. Lebron will be *38* making 40+ million a year. 

Bringing up CP3's massive contract is irrelevant to how bad Lebron's contract is but I'll entertain you. 

The Lakers' goal was to sign two stars. The moment they sacrificed their core to fit two stars instead of one only to sign a 34 year old Lebron, it was over.

On the other hand, the Rockets had and still have one of the oldest teams in the league. Their window is now as evident from their WCF trip. They aren't waiting to grow and develop their core and are in win now mode. Chris Paul is supposed to put them over the top when they're already out of cap space. Lebron James on the other hand puts this team in no man's land while no FA is willing to join this team for good reason. ",nba

"It matters because he’d actually be in 3rd? He wouldn’t be in 5th. You don’t give the MVP to the best player on the 5th seed team because so many other teams are outplaying that team, that you have to ask yourself whether the value he provides is actually the most valuable in the league when it’s not even good enough to help his team be better than those other teams.

It doesn’t effect his intrinsic value to the team, which is what you seem to be arguing, IMO, but getting the 3rd seed *actually does effect* that player’s value with respect to the league. If he was the 5-seed, as a voter, you’re asking yourself, if he was the *most* valuable, couldn’t he have won a game or two more that they lost along the way in order to get to that 3rd seed? Getting to the 3rd seed is a reflection that for this particular season, he’s shown his value by winning all the games he’s needed to to get to that spot. 

If OKC is winning games left and right still, and they still had the 3rd seed, then Harden might not be the *most* valuable, because he couldn’t do for his team what George’s able to do.

"I think basketball, unlike the other “big 4” sports, is the one where you absolutely have to look at team success. The NBA is a superstar league, and superstars win championships and games. Basketball is rare in the fact that you can impose your will throughout the entirety of a game on BOTH sides of the floor. Baseball players get 1 at bat for every 8 teammates, NFL players only play 1 position, hockey players see about 20 mins ice time per game (1/3rd of game time). It’s not uncommon to see NBA stars play 40+ minutes a night. The best player on the floor gives their team the best chance to win. Simply put, the team with the best player should win on most nights. ESPECIALLY this Lakers team. Lebron was not surrounded by a bunch of fumbling idiots. But you’ve got to be willing to do it on both ends. Lebron hasn’t seemed too interested in playing defense this year. When you’re essentially down a man (your superstar) on one end, it makes it very difficult to be successful as a team.",nba

He stocked up the Magic/Kareem duo.  He brought up Pat Riley. He draft Worthy, and Byron Scott, and AC Green, and Vlade, and brought in Eddie Jones and Van Excel. He set up the Shaq deal. He got Kobe. He brought in Phil Jackon.  Two dynasties he put together.  And then, when in Memphis, he gifted the Lakers with Gasol.

And Dr. Buss nixeed certain moves that would have helped, like bringing in McGrady.

Dr. Buss deserve credit for not micro managing and supporting his guys, but when it came time to chooe between West and Jackson, he chose Jackson, and as a result, it was the Warriors that Wet helped build his third dynasty with, and now it i the Clippers who have hi services.

If Dr. Buss had stuck with Jerry West, the Lakers would be in a far better position now.

I don't mean to diss Dr. Buss; I just feel like Jerry West doesn't get enough credit in these conversations.

Dr. Buss was the owner of the Lakers. It was easy to sign free agent, but it was West's drafting and trades that put this thi franchise on the map over the last 35 years.  It was when West left that the franchise started to fall, and it was when the final piece that West had brought in retired that the team flatlined.

Garnett in his last season before being trade to Boston saw his team go into the lottery and was posting his losted FG% in five years.  Ray Allen shot a ten-year low from the arc his last season in Seattle, and never shot that low again for the rest of his career.

Seriously, every single game, a fan of the opposing team will comment on how this is PLAYOFF INTENSITY and they LOVE IT and meanwhile... for the Warriors, that's every night.  It's not possible to maintain that level of intensity all season. The one time they did, it caused what we'll call ""issues"" in the playoffs, and they're older now than they were then.

Most games? They're not trying that hard. They'll win if they can win by applying moderate effort, unless they just cannot bring themselves to bother, if it's the Nuggets or the Thunder they'll actually lock in and try for real because those are apparently the teams they actually see as real threats, and mostly they're just trying not to get hurt, because last season was a horror show for injuries and this season hasn't been ideal.

Fundamentally, though, comparison to the Warriors isn't the point. The point is how do they compare to the teams lower down the table. The Thunder are the sixth seed, and in a seven-game series? The only team I'd say I'm sure could take them is the Bucks.

Shaq got peeved at Tex Winter's comments about his defense in the Finals against Detroit, then Phil was let go which led him to feel the Buss family was making decisions to cater to Kobe.

He was offered to a number of teams - including DALLAS for DIRK but Cuban said no. Miami swooped in after word got out of the ultimatum.
