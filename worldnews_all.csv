Unless we see someone that can motivate dems the way Trump can motivate the reps soon it could just be more of what it's been: people who don't *really* care either way choosing not to vote so they can avoid the problem and people who feel an intense hatred towards a certain party gathering together and making sure they vote. 

And whatever side the people in power choose will likely win. All it takes for some people is a single commercial the day before voting to remind/convince for someone to vote and since people tend to vote for familiar faces/names whoever can advertise more will likely win.

&gt; NEW YORK - Three men and a teenager have been arrested after planning to bomb a Muslim community in upstate New York, and investigators have recovered three homemade bombs and nearly two dozen guns, authorities said on Tuesday.

&gt; The alleged plot was uncovered after a student at Odyssey Academy, a school in Greece, New York, showed a classmate a photograph of another student and said, &amp;quot;He looks like the next school shooter, doesn&amp;#039;t he?&amp;quot; Greece Police Chief Patrick Phelan told reporters at a news conference.

&gt; The group had planned to attack Islamberg, a small enclave in the Catskill Mountains about 150 miles northwest of New York City.

China doesn’t have the blue water (away from the coast) naval experience, so while they’re building carriers, they’re still learning to run one based on the old Russian carrier they bought from Ukraine with a shell company.

They will also likely be able to get more specifically favorable trade deals with Anglosphere countries and countries like Japan than they did as part of the EU because they don't have to make concessions to continental interests that often conflict with UK interests.

The US have been doing this since Carter. So this is nothing new.

In April 1980, border patrol agents faced off with a group of 500 illegals who had gathered near San Ysidro.

&gt;Tear gas was also used at the border in 2007 in response to attacks on border agents with stones, bottles, bricks and ball bearings fired with slingshots. Border Patrol officials argued then that the use of nonlethal force was a potentially life-saving measure, not only for law enforcement officers but also for those throwing the rocks; stone throwers at the border were fatally shot in 2005 and 2007.

"So far you have explained that :

1. London losing high paying jobs leads to a decrease in housing prices;
2. a decrease in housing prices means new homeowner have more discretionary spending by saving money on new homes;
3. savings by new homeowner creates jobs by increasing the net amount of discretionary spending.

1 &amp; 2 may be true, but 3 is false. Let me explain why. When someone buys a home, it means someone sold it. If a house loses value, it doesn't change the amount an existing homeowner has to pay on his mortgage. So, is there a net gain of discretionary spending in a decreasing housing market? Probably not because for every corresponding gains by buyers there is a corresponding loss by sellers who still have to pay off their mortgages.

Also, negative returns on investments don't generally tend to increase investments. Since construction-related employment accounts for about 14% of jobs in London(1), there will probably be a general decrease in employment in London.

Also, keep in mind this discussion is in the context of London losing high paying jobs. So your logic is basically :

Lose high paying job

"Lula was white (to the extent that Brazilians are white, anyway), look up a picture of him before you make a fool of yourself like this.

"&gt; Bottom line, addiction is classified as a disease because it causes actual, physical harm to the body and brain and typically cannot be overcome without treatment. Obesity is just the latest in the list of potential addictions that should be included in treatment options.

Ehhh. So long as you're being completely clear that it's the addiction, ie: Decision to keep using that causes harm, then I agree. Your lack of appetite, poor decision making due to poor mental state and risk taking behavior is what actually causes the most damage (OD's and murders make up the deaths). It's pretty well known that most ""hard"" drugs you'll end up dying from external factors like misuse or risky frisky behavior.  Take heroin for example. You do know that heroin itself doesn't cause really any damage by itself right? All the damage is done through misuse and risky addiction thinking. Like morphine, it's perfectly safe when dosed and used ""correctly"" but the risk of abuse is too high (haha) to warrant a need for it. Plus we have fentanyl now, we gucci.

 Bottom line is, when used ""correctly"", it's less damaging to the body than tylonyl, or other common OTC medication.

&gt; If you have lung cancer, you have to choose to accept treatment to get cured.

The difference is, you can choose treatment, but you cannot just choose to not suffer from it like you can addiction. That's a huge difference. You really think people with cancer would be afraid of two weeks of hell to be completely cured? They'd take that opportunity like Jared in a day care. You're completely glossing over the fact that addiction can be cured with NO external factors. Literally just sit on your ass, do nothing, you're good. You can't just avoid lung cancer by not going outside. Addiction is also 100% curable at any stage, whereas real diseases you can't just decide to be healthy, you have to take medication, get treatment, Xrays, follow ups. Anyone who is an addict can technically stop today, no doctors, no help, literally don't need a single other person (makes it a lot easier) or external factor to cure you. That's not a disease, just a decision. Not to mention, I could get treatment for cancer, do literally every single thing I can, and still die. If you do literally every single thing you can, nothing held back, you'll overcome your addiction.

So does over-working. Co-dependancy, and poor self esteem. Chronic masturbation too. I guess technically anything that has negative health consequences is a disease?

My main point is, it should be classified as a mental disorder. That's how it manifests. Realistically, I just don't feel right calling something that is just a series of poor decisions a disease. I personally feel it takes away from the responsibility of the individual to buy some bootstraps and pull themself up.

Regardless of all the science, studies, and opinions, you can't quit until you've made the decision to stop using. No argument, you gotta actually want to quit to be successful. No one has accidentally ""cured"" themselves of addiction while still wanting to use.

My question is, what's the difference between a disease and a mental disorder then? What's the point of even labeling them if pretty much everything can be classified as a disease.

Is my depression a disease? Also, are there any medical/insurance benefits to classifying it as a disease? Do you get more funding, taken more seriously?

&gt;Not at all true. An addiction changes the neural pathways of your brain, causing damage. This is why it is considered a disease. It can be treated, but strong addictions almost always require help to overcome.

*Almost*. Funny how you always have to have that disclaimer, because you and I both know it's entirely possible to quit 100% on your own, simply because you want to. It's not easy, common, or fun, but it happens. Again, if all that's standing between you and death is to just not do anything (no treatment, no doctors, no risk barring some drugs), that's not exactly a disease in my opinion.

Overall, like I said, I understand addiction way more than you'd assume. And I'm sorry, but unless someone's talking from experience, there's very little to weigh in. That would be like a ""healthy"" person trying to give advice on depression with literally no background, not a good idea.

And I'm not denying that it *could* be classified as a disease. I just don't understand this huge jump to take responsibility away from the addict to make the change. Some people need more help than others, I get that. Still, it's 100% up to them, and them only to take the first and last steps. Just from many years of experience, when you stop expecting someone to help themselves, and don't require a heavy input from them to solve their own problems (with help, of course), you're not going to cure anything, nor help them. That only strengthens their belief that they have no control, and the fact is, they're the only ones with control.

&gt; Taiwan&amp;#039;s Central News Agency reported that Admiral Lou gave a long speech on the state of Sino-US relations, where he declared that the trade spat was &amp;quot;Definitely not simply friction over economics and trade,&amp;quot; but a &amp;quot;Prime strategic issue.&amp;quot; And that if China wants the US to back off, it must be willing to attack US ships when they intrude in Chinese territory.

&gt; BEIJING - China&amp;#039;s economic growth hit a three-decade low in 2018, adding to pressure on Beijing to beef up stimulus measures and settle a tariff war with Washington.

&gt; Growth slowed to 6.6 percent from 2017&amp;#039;s 6.9 percent as both the world&amp;#039;s appetite for China&amp;#039;s exports and domestic consumer spending weakened, official data showed Monday.

&gt; Communist leaders want to steer China toward slower, more self-sustaining growth driven by consumer spending instead of trade and investment.

"&gt;What's the proportion 

That is immaterial to my argument. Everyone knows it is beneficial to the 'herd' overall. If you continue this line of 'reasoning' I will ignore you.

&gt;and that should be enough

Tell that to the people who's lives have been changed through no fault of their own and while taking the advice of our medical system. Keep in mind that **all** of those people who experienced an Adverse Reaction went in to get the (or their child's) vaccination because they thought it was the right thing to do.

&gt;Do you just want people to be nicer to each other? Do you think that's the real problem here?

That is certainly part of it. The level of vitriol in the posts below directed at human beings acting on fear is counterproductive. If a Mom has a kid who suffers a reaction then states she doesn't want to vaccinate another of her kids, people online shit all over her.

The real problem here is that instead of tackling the problem, victims are made to feel like an enemy of the state.

&gt;Because I think not calling out and properly criticizing bullshit is exactly how we got here in the first place.

How we got here in the first place is that hundreds of people suffered Adverse Reactions through no fault of their own and were largely ignored. More recently ""calling out and properly criticizing bullshit"" has become a sport for some (r/vaxxhappened for instance) and people have lost the plot.

For me, the frustrating part is that your solution is now being championed by people who are **just as undereducated** as the 'antivaxxers' fed by the plethora of pharmaceutical industry information.

"The qing had been trying to prevent opium use and trade for decades, and had been trying to monopolize trade for their entire existence. The British trumping the sovereignty of the qing on these issues is hardly a small matter. The only reason the opium wars were not more significant was the choice of the qing to give up fairly quickly to the British. They would have lost complete control of the coastal areas if they insisted on fighting because the people along the coast didn't care what the dynasty wanted and were happy to deal with the British.

If the dynasty had been representing the people, and the coastal population hadn't been indifferent to the rules of the dynasty, the war wouldn't have gone the same way. 

The reason the British naval superiority over the dynastic military was such a humiliation was that it showed that the population was waiting for someone to free them from the influence of the dynastic inflexibility.

"&gt; Brtain wanted to leave the EU, not be encumbered by EU regulations on manufacturing, and re-establsh border control to revent the flw of eoole and goods?

This isn't accurate. The arguments to leave are numerous and varied, and are not in any way a chorus. Look at coverage before the referendum, and a recurring theme was the UK staying in the single market post Brexit and generally maintaining ""business as usual"" but with a relationship closer to what Norway has with the EU.

Once the results came in and a few months passed, that rhetoric slowly shifted to no deal being a viable option, the concept that all our EU trade deals are shit (they're not, they're out bread and butter money makers by a massive margin) and we need new *better* ones with other nations outside of Europe.

If anyone has presented to you the image that the UK voted leave to do something very particular and focused, they're lying to you. Ask most leavers why they voted, and then look up some figures on what they're saying. You'll often find that reality is the opposite of what they're saying.

On top of that, /u/Spektroz claiming that the EU is now punishing the UK by not bending over backwards to accomodate us is also inaccurate.

The EU has always been clear that there's no such thing as ""partial membership"" and access to the single market comes with obligations that the UK, and May specifically, have made their red lines.

The EU isn't going to break their well established standards and rules to accomodate a country that wants to leave the union. They have made considerations for some nations in the past, but that always comes with strict obligations i.e. passing legislation that will align that nation with EU rules, or accepting freedom of movement (one of May's red lines). In that situation, they're abiding by EU rules but have zero say in what those rules are.

So in short, the UK has spent 2 years since the referendum fruitlessly demanding the EU let them have their cake and eat it too. The entire time they've been told that isn't a possibility, and rather than adjust the demands or call quits on Brexit all together, they've decided to run down the clock to pressure parliament into taking some mildly revised version of May's shit deal, with the other option being an even more devastating no deal scenario.

"Your perception is clearly not aligned with reality.  The British were NOT comparable to the Nazis.  I never indicated that everything they or the allies did was defensible (especially when it comes to the Soviets).

I glanced at the rest of your statements but as soon as I read ""They are the same"" I knew you were not credible.  The country that blunted the Luftwaffe's momentum and fought back the campaign of indiscriminate bombing of civilian centers by the Nazis (At least until the V1 and V2) is clearly not the same as Nazi Germany, who had a state run system of oppression that eventually resulted in the  murdere of millions and millions, the Nazis who violated international treaties, the Nazis  who initiated a truly global war, the Nazis who enslaved and murdered millions of POWs, the Nazis who placed sirens on their Stuka dive bombers specifically to strike terror into the hearts of whoever they were attacking, civilian and soldier alike, the Nazis who were found guilty of war crimes after they were defeated.  

You'd have to be an idiot and would have to ignore the true facts and evidence of how truly evil the Nazis were, to say that the enemy of the Nazis are their identical counterpart.

By such a shallow assertion you could argue that if you swapped out Hitler's Reichstag for Chamberlain's Parliament (You could argue that Churchill never would have become prime minister had it not been for Nazi aggression), that the British would have then went and oppressed and eventually tried to exterminate the Jews.  After all, in your own words, ""they are the same"".  Despite fire bombing later in the war, one would have to be an utter fool to truly believe there is no difference between the British and the Nazis.

You can try to refute this, but you said yourself the British and the Nazis are one in the same, which history has clearly shown is not accurate.  You don't get to be selective when you say they are identical.

Now the way Britain exploited ""uncivilized"" peoples in the 18th and 19th centuries is another story and I see you mentioned that in one of your attempts at a rebuttal.  However, imperial Britain of earlier centuries and Britain in the mid 20th century were two very different animals.  WWII helped lead Britain away from colonialism, however this only accelerated the decolonization attitude in Britain that existed since WWI.  You trying to compare imperial Britain with mechanized Nazi Germany is just plain laughable and any rational person can see it's trying to compare apples and oranges.  The Britain you compared Nazi Germany to in your rebuttal did not even have an air Force yet because it was before planes were invented!  The Britain you equivocate with Nazi Germany couldn't even bomb indiscriminately as flight was still far in the future.  Come on man, THINK!  Apples and Oranges.

The impending exploitation of Africa by China is going to make the last 200 years of European exploitation look like child’s play. Goodbye Africa’s environment as we know it.

"It does hold, but you have to understand how Buddhism actually works. No part of Buddhism can be truly held in a vacuum because it all intersects and supports other parts. The Eightfold Path is something you practice together and not as eight separate pieces.

The precepts are taken daily. You take them in the morning and you adhere to them as best you can. If you break one, there's some practices to do to restore the commitment.

Killing, however, is special. Killing carries an enormous burden. I mean ... someone is *dead* because of the intentions and actions of another person. That is not at all equivalent to lying or stealing, and Buddhists aren't so naiive as to pretend it is. It's very, very heavy.

If you take the precept and kill anyway, why would anyone consider you to really be a Buddhist? If you know it's wrong, if you know it goes against the core principles, teachings, and ethics of the Buddha-dhamma, but you do it anyway and you do it repeatedly, then no one is going to consider you a Buddhist.

We have here the ""Boy Who Cried Wolf"" situation, or the case of the drug addict who keeps promising they'll get clean but they just keep going back to drugs over and over and over and it's neither rational or compassionate to believe them when they say they're going to get clean.

This isn't about strict adherence to clearly-defined ""rules"", this is about actually living by your vow to take the precepts, keep the precepts, learn the teachings, put the teachings into practice, and actually make real efforts to realize the path.

I can compare it to someone who says they're a university student ... but they don't actually go to university, they're not taking any courses, not taking any exams, not earning any credits toward a degree. Other students, professors, and administration of the university wouldn't consider that person a student.

"Here's my guess:

1. Vote goes ahead on Tuesday on whether Parliament will accept May's Brexit deal.
2. Government will lose the vote. As a result of one of the amendments passed by those in opposition to the deal, the Government will have 3 days to present a ""Plan B"". This would have been 21 days if the amendment had failed.
3. Plan B will be the Government announcing a vote on the cancellation of Brexit with the aim being to withdraw the Article 50 notice, as confirmed as legal by the ECJ. May has threatened during one of the Prime Ministers Question sessions (PMQs) that she would cancel Brexit if her deal was defeated, and this I think is the Plan B. 

May has been playing the long game here I think. She wants the deal to fail to pass through Parliament so that she can carry out her threat, a threat she made because that is what she actually wants to happen. She did campaign for Remain during the Brexit referendum and she wouldn't have made that threat if she wasn't willing to go through with it. She could have easily threatened to go ahead with no-deal Brexit if the deal didn't pass through Parliament, going for the ""have some of it or none of it"" approach.

If she pulls this off, I'd be very impressed although this is only part of the problem. May could potentially keep the UK in the EU but the EU needs to improve their Public Relations. MPs have a history of blaming the EU for nearly every major problem faced in the UK, which lead to the issue that the Remain campaign had in regards to explaining why the EU was important. Leave had an easier message to sell, even though it was built on lies. A message that doesn't need to be explained will always be better than a message that needs explaining in regards to telling the public why they should support one side of an argument over another.

Honestly, this needs to be a wake up call for the EU in regards to how they sell themselves to the citizens of the member states. The clusterfuck that was the Brexit deal negotiations have helped massively with support for the EU, but unless the EU themselves can explain why they are needed on a level the general public can understand and support, there will always be the risk of a member state voting to leave.

I'm pretty sure there are 4 state investigations that are going on right now into both his enormous amount of tax fraud and his blatant emoluments violations. Honestly the emoluments violations are what I'm most concerned about. 

Something about politicians using their positions to funnel money into their own pockets, especially the president, leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

Why do you believe Trump is the best? He's an awful negotiator, he's barely gotten anything done, and the economy is crashing down around him. The market took its sweet time to correct what with all the buybacks and tax cut injection, but it corrected and it's just going to keep doing so. 

Wages have stagnated and are losing against inflation, our debt is way more out of control than it has any right to be, and our markets with the rest of the world are being hurt, not helped, by Trump's egotistical and completely idiotic trade wars. And our government's shut down because he's throwing a tantrum about his vanity project. I'm going to guess this next recession is going to be just as bad if not worse than 2008, and now we have zero Clinton ridiculously effective fiscal policy money in the tank to make up for it. Instead of a useless tax cut for the rich on the tail end of a boom (who in their right mind thought that was a good idea? Oh right, the guy who benefits from a tax cut for the rich) we should have been collecting money ad trying to actually fix our budget. Our country is pretty screwed to be entirely honest.

And we still spend the most on healthcare and yet have the shittiest coverage in the world. And we still spend moronic amounts of taxpayer money on a military that we use for politics more than anything useful. 

Trump's not only an idiot who's terrible for our foreign relations, he's done nothing useful at all. He's even proven how little he cares about conservative values and just up and outlawed bumpstocks all by himself. Just unilaterally made a bunch of people's property suddenly illegal. He's not the worst president we've ever had, I would argue even Bush was worse just on a moral standpoint, the man started a war for no reason. Reagan was worse for the economy, he started the war on drugs, bloated the military even more, and just exploded our debt, and I mean we had Andrew Jackson and Richard Nixon at one point.

Agree that both no Brexit and no deal will be bad for UK either way but no deal in my opinion runs a high risk of being very bad both internationally and nationally so is the worst option of the two. 

Having Brexit stopped with a referendum will mitigate the fallout of no Brexit massively. Obviously, stopping Brexit with one is far from a given but since all the polls I've seen that show variations of, no Brexit, no deal, or May's deal as options- no  Brexit and May's deal are always ahead so no deal is avoided.

The Supreme Court. McConnell damaged the Court by putting obviously biased judges onto a court that absolutely needs to be impartial. Anything that even gives the perception of a skewed court would deal immense damage to the court's credibility, and Kavanaugh's confirmation did exactly that.

Alright, that's that.  At the end of the period you specified, using only the amount an employee would invest in SS as the amount invested into the market, we didn't reach that $1M mark.  I will grant, however, that if you had the employee invest double the amount to reach that 12.4%, they could have hit $1M.  But that's requiring the employee pay twice as much into the market as they would pay into SS, and not taking into account commissions, fees, minimum investments,  etc.

There is one other issue here though: none of this takes into account inflation.  That website you linked?  It has different return rates when you factor in inflation.

That same year, a Kremlin-connected think tank released a report entitled, “Putin: World Conservativism’s New Leader.” In 2015, Russia hosted a delegation from the National Rifle Association, one of America’s most influential conservative lobby groups, which included David Keene, then-president of the NRA and now editor of the Washington Times editorial page, which regularly features voices calling for a friendlier relationship with Moscow.

When the territory was divided, it was Israel for the Palestinian Jews, Jordan for the Palestinian Arabs. Jordan Arabs are Palestinians because they're Arabs from the former territory Palestine. The Arabs lost the war of aggression they launched and lost the west bank in the battle. Following Israeli occupation of the west bank, Jordan revoked Palestinian citizenship and created an artificial division between Jordanians and the new refugee group dubbed Palestinians. Revoking Palestinian citizenship is politically advantageous and quietly continues to this day, with Palestinians learning they're stateless when going to renew their drivers license and get a birth certificate.

&gt; A former security guard for the US firm Blackwater has been found guilty of murder for his role in a notorious massacre of unarmed civilians in downtown Baghdad in 2007.

&gt; Slatten was convicted of killing Ahmed Haithem Ahmed Al Rubia&amp;#039;y, 19, an aspiring doctor who was one of more than a dozen civilians killed by Blackwater guards in Baghdad&amp;#039;s Nisour square on 16 September 2007.

&gt; While escorting a diplomatic convoy, Blackwater guards opened fire in the bustling square with sniper rifles, machine guns and grenade launchers - allegedly without provocation - leaving at least 14 civilians dead and at least 18 wounded.

&gt;“Chinese companies are not necessarily interested in the very upstream exploration,” Prince said. “They want to buy something in production, which leaves that gap for us.”

Remember his dramatic change from supporting left wing policy to right wing policy? It was about as sharp a U turn as I've ever seen in American politics. Did anyone ever wonder why that happened? The GOP will hate to hear this, but it's because their base is easier to manipulate. Democrats have always had a more progressive platform. Imagine Putin trying to connect with that. It would be impossible. Democrats, for the last 20+ years have leaned towards hope and possibility for change. While Republicans have leaned towards fear and being a victim. It sucks that this is the truth because I have friends and family that have fallen into this trap too. Ultimately what it comes down to is Putin knew Trump would never have a chance running on his actual beliefs - so he forced him to change. Trump has been living a lie for many many years. I urge you to really look at this as an outsider observing evidence and make your judgement - so many people have blinders on about this and that is how Trump got elected to begin with.

"That we are omnivores is very questionable, but a large portion of us aren't emotionally strong enough to honestly consider, contemplate or converse about the evidence. It's that we don't want to accept the conclusion that the evidence is pointing toward as we examine it. Lying to oneself fixes the emotional problem well. 

Just because we can eat meat doesn't mean it is the optimal food for us nor that we evolved eating it like we image we did. I've seen a starving cow eat a small live bird whole, masticating much like it was grass. That didn't make it a carnivore nor omnivore though, did it? 

One could compare our teeth, our digestive system, our initial behavior in regard to causing suffering and death toward animals, and our inability to deal with dietary cholesterol, without contributing to heart disease, to other animals. That indicates we are closer to being herbivores. Again, herbivores *can* eat meat. They just don't process the cholesterol optimally. Omnivores and carnivores can just fine. You only get dietary cholesterol from food from animals, not from plants. We have the same problem with cholesterol in our food as herbivores do.

Our teeth are closer to plant eating animals than omnivores nor carnivores. They have pointy teeth for penetrating and tearing flesh. We, like herbivores, favor cutting and grinding for eating plants.

The stomach acid is weaker in herbivores than omnivores and carnivores have even stronger stomach acid, for digesting meat.

The digestive track of carnivores is shorter. They don't get as much fiber and the material shouldn't linger so long, as there are more toxic byproducts that harm health inside the waste. It's longer in omnivores and longest in herbivores. They pass more fiber, so they can keep the flow going better.

One of the most obvious things is behavior. Well, only if you observe it with your mind's eye. Observe children witnessing killing animals for the first time. They act like they are witnessing a demonic ritual and don't hold it back, so much of the time. This shows they aren't so naturally inclined to this behavior. However, when you expose cats or dogs, much farther along the scale toward carnivore, but still somewhat omnivore, to prey, they have a thrill playing hunt and kill. They don't have to be taught. They'd have to punished for doing it to stop it. Our children are the opposite. They have be trained to accept it. The behavior we have killing animals is not so innate.

I find it interesting how many fruits my cats don't want to eat, while I find them delicious. Our kids often love fruits without training at all. We can twist ourselves into almost any kind of behavior we want and then fool ourselves that we've done so. It doesn't change the underlying reality though. That takes more time and change.

Maybe if we try hard enough, we can evolve to have a mouth full of pointy teeth and a love for hunting and killing more like a raptor or lion. Wow, that's what we really want to be, isn't it? 

*Now I'll go back to my chicken, shrimp and chorizo fajitas with sour cream, with a small side of hypocrisy. Just because I have come to these unhealthy habits doesn't mean I have to ignore the evidence against what I am still doing. I am strong enough to tell the truth in such a scenario. Sure, it's weak to not adapt to it, but being able to accept the truth even if it contradicts what you prefer to do is a strength I value even more. It's the precursor for almost all positive change. Truth sets us free by allowing us to make choices more aligned with what actually is.* ",worldnews

The question isn't about whether people want to go to war because you as well as I know nearly every soldier thinks that the suffering individual soldiers cause and receive isn't worth what manybwars gain us. The question is, do you have a valid exemption from joining. While this may not make sense to you, the exemption for service isn't ""I don't want to kill people because I think killing is wrong"" the exemption is, ""under no circumstance would I use lethal force on any individual under any circumstance"".

A great example of this would be if you owned a gun to defend your home, you would not be able to claim you were allowed to be exempt. Being willing to kill someone to defend yourself, but being unwilling to go to war shows that you're willing to kill, just not for what the state is asking you for, which is against the law.

"I don't know much about this missile other than what's in the article, but I think you may be confused if you're talking about size. The reason this missile is large is because it's a ballistic missile. It goes up into space before coming down on its target.

See, the thing about being a ""carrier killer"" is getting there. A man with a bomb strapped to his back can be a ""carrier killer"" if it's the right kind of bomb and if you can get him on the carrier. The problem with your Mach 2 sea-skimming missile is that it's too slow. A carrier group's detection radius is 200 km, which gives them plenty of time to detect the missile and shoot it down. Carriers have Mach 3 and Mach 4 missiles just for this purpose.

This Chinese missile is an IRBM, meaning it reenters the atmosphere at Mach 20 to Mach 25. That is way too fast to be shot down **unless you can plot its course exactly**. Anti-ballistic missiles work on the principle that the target they're shooting down may be fast but it's on a ballistic trajectory that was locked in when its motor burnt up its fuel and detached. Your satellites give you early warning of the launch, they monitor the course and get a trajectory, and then you send an ABM to kill it.

But the difference in this Chinese missile is that it's a ballistic missile but **it's also maneuverable**. It has fins that act as control surfaces to make course changes. So the mainstay of ballistic missile defense, which is that they can't change course, is lost. Here is a missile that travels at ballistic missile speeds, but is still maneuverable. Which means it can make course changes to avoid being hit, and make course changes to follow the carrier if the carrier tries to evade it.

Probably there is other technology is development that attempts to deal with the problem of Mach 20 ballistic missiles that act as cruise missiles, but it's not just a matter of size. Like I said, this is big because it's ballistic.",worldnews

It is clear that Russia is attempting to undermine and influence western democracy especially in Europe but in the United States as well, Russia has been our ideological opposition for quite some time whether it was been Communist and Capitalist ideologies or otherwise. Russia and China are both our rivals and at time, our enemies as well.

That being said, many of the vulnerabilities outlined in that book are true and thats why they work. this tactic only works if it is A. Failed to be recognized by the public at large and B. Adopted as a political strategy for personal gain. America is a highly diverse and independent nation, turning that diversity against us by creating friction between other groups is how you weaken us and turn us against one another. Russia will never be able to conquer the continental US, but it could distract us long enough to give itself more flexibility on the world state and become a more disruptive actor in Europe. 

Now to speak specifically to the proposed doctrine regarding the US, Trump has indeed made the US more isolationist, but i think that this policy is a welcome change from the highly interventionist approuch we had for decades before, i do not think it is either fair or wise to intervene military on the behalf of those who do not appreciate it, much of the Anti-western extremist groups were born out of hatred for our action in that region of the world, the middle east is today's staging ground for proxy wars. I think the attitude of taking care of yourself before you can take care of anyone else is an appropriate attitude, especially with how determined the rest world is to satisfy it's own interests first.

The other half of the coin is the identitarianism that plagues our society today, in decades prior this kind of overt racism toward any ethnic group (even the majority) would be rejected, i believe the key to harmony is a message that encourages neutrality and equality, but not to the point where the gripes of a complaining group are weaponized as political power against what they percieve to be their opposition, this only creates new animosity, I believe that the Left has largely adopted a culture of identity politics in order to muster the political power required to defeat Trump and bring a return to the status quo where they were in charge, its a desperate move which hurts America and it puts us right where Russia (And China) wants us for the purposes of creating a distraction. Although the left will claim that the right has all of the identitarians, there is very little open rhetoric specifically demanding that minority groups adhere to right-wing rhetoric, although im sure quite a few leftists would disagree with me.

This is a problem that we need to solve ourselves, but as long as identity politics is being wielded as an instrument to gain or maintain power, it will never be resolved, until then we can only try to resist it and denounce it on an individual basis.",worldnews

"&gt;If you spend your time stocking up for the Apocalypse then there's definitely something wrong with you. I'm not saying that preppers are bad people or dangerous. But I am saying that there's something wrong with them.

Right. And I'm saying that that isn't necessarily true. 

&gt;I'd be supportive in suggesting that they seek counseling. But it's unhealthy behavior and shouldn't be enabled.

It can be unhealthy--but anything *can* be. Prepping for itself is not unhealthy however. That is something you will need to defend I think, and I don't think you could.

&gt;Sorry, but that's an excuse.

It's not an excuse. It's an explanation.

No it's not. I'm saying that prepping cannot be taken on its own as a sign that someone is psychologically unhealthy.

Again--I never excused it. My position is that it doesn't require an excuse.

There are plenty of non-military preppers too. I will say this. I know a lot of preppers. I met them after I became curious about modern day prepping communities and did some outreach (don't ask--it was relevant to my work). I can say this with absolute certainty: they're not insane. None of the preppers I know believe there is an impending apocalypse, nor do they believe anything of the sort is likely.

"&gt;With all this mounting evidence and guilty staff surrounding and incriminating Trump

Guilty charges of people Trump employed: Flynn for lying to the FBI, Manafort for tax evasion from a decade ago (when he was working with the Podesta brothers/Clintons/Obama), Cohen for ""campaign finance violations"" for a payment to Stormy Daniels...

Far from providing any evidence of the collusion between Trump and Russia the media and Democrats were hoping it would find, Mueller's investigation has failed to even paint a clear picture that any such conspiracy existed. All the charges he's brought aren't even loosely related, they've been a bunch of disjointed indictments for wildly varying things, all of which established - at best - only tenuous links between Trump and Russia, and in some were not even remotely related to one or the other. It's a fishing expedition that has come up empty handed in its primary purpose.

There is no evidence against Trump, which is why your Guardian article above doesn't list any evidence against him under his section. The media and Dems have only clung to the conspiracy theory because:

- a) Trump's election illustrated the increasing irrelevance of the liberal legacy media in the internet age, who, for the first time since the invention of the press, found themselves impotent to destroy a political candidate they disliked

- b) the Democrats were too arrogant and bigoted to admit any fault, and wanted a boogeyman to blame for losing

Both are too heavily invested in the Russia conspiracies to turn back now. No matter what Mueller finds they will judge Trump guilty, because reversing course would only be an even bigger blow to their already shakey credibility.

&gt;Why is it you support this man?

You know, there are actual reasons why Brexit and Trump won. The North of England and the rust belt in the US are former industrial heartlands. For decades both were bulwarks of leftist political power, with unionized, working class populations that voted for strong social welfare policies. It was assumed both would invariably vote as they always had, which led to confident predictions that Brexit would fail and Trump would be defeated by the Democrats ""blue wall.""

But liberals sacrificed the working class, sold their livelihoods down the river in favor of globalist free trade deals and mass immigration, while erecting strict, politically correct boundaries to prevent any criticism of these policies. The left now look down their noses at their former ""non-college educated white"" voter base, whom today they regard with thinly veiled contempt as racist troglodytes, that are irrelevant in the new multicultural utopia... Then were ""stunned"" by ""unforeseeable"" election defeats when this demographic turned against them. Apparently ""you disagree with our policies? Too bad, we know what's best for you. Now shut up and vote for us you racist scum!"" wasn't such a brilliant election strategy after all, who would've guessed?

The left has absolved itself of responsibility and brushed aside any discussion of these realities, by instead choosing to focus on conspiracy theories.

The growth of right-wing populism in the West had been occurring for well over a decade. Ignoring it and arrogantly dismissing it as a fad that would evaporate didn't make it go away. Alienating anyone who questioned liberal orthodoxy as Nazis and racists didn't stop the steady hemorrhaging of support. Do you really think the left's recent brainwave to restart the Cold War - because they want a boogeyman to blame election losses on, while continuing to double down on the policies that caused it in the first place - is going to be the key to reversing the trend?",worldnews

&gt; The Lead. The world&amp;#039;s oceans are warming much faster than previously thought, according to a new study published Thursday in the journal Science.

&gt; Oceans are heating up 40 per cent faster, on average, than a United Nations panel estimated five years ago, thus pushing ocean temperatures to record highs for several straight years, the study found.

&gt; Oceans absorbed 93 per cent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases pumped into the atmosphere, which explains the rapid rise in temperature.

There is a simple mathematical reason for this. 

Lets say employees are 30% of cost. If you cut their pay in half it only reduced cost 15%. But if you double their pay it only raises the cost 30%. 

So prices go up 30%, but everyone makes twice as much, so they have a 70% effective increase in wages over the increased cost increase. 

So raising wages increases buying power significantly faster than the increase in cost it causes. 

But the opposite for cost cutting. If you cut their wages in half it would only have a 15% savings in the overall cost.

"People really overstate how bad nuclear fallout is.  They forget that we have tested over one thousand bombs, with many being a lot dirtier than what we have in ICBMs.

"&gt;The Ukraine is a callback to it being a Soviet Republic.

False. The 15 Soviet republics were considered countries - every republic's name follows the country convention, in English and Russian (e.g. Lithuania, Kyrgyzia/Kyrgystan, Belarus, etc.). The Soviet government was quite centralized in practice (although Ukraine was, if anything, the 2nd most powerful republic - e.g. Khrushyov made his career in Ukraine, Brezhnev and Gorbachyov were both half-Ukrainian), but formally the USSR was a voluntary union of independent nation-states, with the right to leave given by the Constitution (a right that was hypothetical at first, but eventually exercised by some republics in 1990-1991). 

""The Ukraine"" is a callback to the fact that prior to the 20th century it wasn't its own country, but only a vaguely-defined region. For this reason it had a non-country form to the name (like ""the Low Countries"" or ""the Pale"") - in English, Russian, German, Polish, and probably others.

Being of Ukrainian descent myself, I agree that ""Ukraine"" is correct - Ukraine is a country and wants to be called the same way all its neighbors are - the US, the UK, etc. aren't fit comparisons. (Just like some Czechs preferring Czechia/Česko to ""the Czech Republic."") However, the people most vehemently pissed off about the mistake are Ukrainian nationalists, who're a cancer upon the already struggling Ukraine, so personally I think it makes very little difference. Foreigners get so many things wrong about Ukraine, messing up the name makes very little difference. It'd be better if you didn't keep pushing for war that bleeds Ukrainians or cheering Ukraine getting taken over by the IMF and raising revenue by raising utility costs on the poor and old...",worldnews

"I live in Canada too.

I've only been in two relationships, and both of them had different political views than me. My first relationship was with a ""far-right"" girlfriend who was using the term libtard and snowflake even though I didn't use those terms to describe liberals ever. My second girlfriend (and now fiance) voted liberal, but she doesn't like legal marijuana and she supports Duterte (she is Filipino). We still got along despite our political differences.

I don't care if people are right or left. First of all, it's their life and their beliefs. They can believe anything they want as long as they don't start hitting other people or breaking the law. Secondly, I find that there are good and bad people on both sides, and that's what really matters. I find that there is more than one way to achieve a goal, and often, the disagreement is about how to achieve freedom and/or safety, and how much of each is required.

I never understood how someone could support Duterte, who kills people for using drugs. But, my fiance said that sometimes it is difficult for a person from one country to fully understand politics in another country. I personally believe in principals that are universal, and which should technically apply to all countries. But, I keep my mind open that maybe there are some human conditions that I do not understand, and maybe my views do not accomodate these people. My experience is only one out of billions, so I might have a pretty narrow view of the world. This is why I try to keep an open mind even when someone isn't making sense.

About your friend who posted ""Two Face Chuch Schumer"", I think we can safely say that most people, including most politicians, are two faced. For example, we don't truly know our spouses until we've been in their lives for at least 3 months. Calling someone two faced is like calling someone a two-legged landlubber. Aren't we all two-faced and two-legged landlubbers? I guess it depends on perspective, which explains why someone might see it while you might not.

We are also probably guilty of being lenient on the politicians we like, and harsh on the politicians we dislike. Maybe your friend has fallen into the trap of assasinating the character of someone who doesn't agree with him. It's a very common pitfall.",worldnews

"TIL how frogs work - thanks!

re the main point, your argument is subtly flawed. this statement is not right:

&gt; Therefore, the only way that the job is filled by a foreign national is because there are insufficient qualified applicants locally

best way to show this is via an example. American Chuck worked a contract last year for $30/hr. This year he seeks $33/hr - usually bc he is finding that his expenses are rising and he needs more (but it doesn't need to be that .. *any* reason will do). But the same type of job is being advertised only at the same rate as last year. Now one of two things can take place: Chuck can accept it, or he can pass it up.  Chuck is representative of  the average american worker .. and we expect other Chucks to pass it up bc they too want more. After 2 weeks or so the employer calls his H-1B agent, and Philippino Angelo swiftly accepts the $30/hr.

Of course, as you say, the Chucks have first dibs .. and they can take it. But if one does, guess what has just taken place? no wage rise! In both cases, the wage stays constant.

Yes, H-1B was created to fulfill genuine shortages. But here you can see it being exploited to achieve another aim by the corporation: apply downward pressure on wages.

Another way to appreciate it is to see it from this alternative perspective: If the employer didn't have the H-1B scheme to use, he would find that after a while $30/hr was not high enough. He would need to offer more. But fortunately Uncle Sam has come to his rescue: using H-1B he can force wages to stagnate.

So let’s use a simple example:

You’re sitting on a bike and begin peddling to 15 mph.

Mathematically, from your frame of reference, the Earth is moving underneath you at 15 mph.

Mathematically, from the Earth’s frame of reference, you are moving across its surface at 15 mph.

Both observations are equally valid and equally invalid.

But let’s look at what happened when you began peddling. Either:

1) You imparted enough force to propel yourself forward across the Earth’s surface at 15 mph while the Earth remained relatively stationary.

2) You imparted enough force to alter the rotational velocity and direction of the Earth by 15 mph while you remained relatively stationary.

Only one of those things actually occurred regardless of how you perceive things from your frame of reference.

Also, you should definitely dive a little deeper into the proofs that the Earth is in motion around the sun. I promise you, very smart people understand what Einstein was saying better than you and it does not conflict with the proofs that the Earth does revolve around the Sun.

&gt; WASHINGTON - In their first action in control of the U.S. House of Representatives, Democrats plan to adopt a bill on Thursday to end a federal shutdown without funding a Mexican border wall, trying to firmly fasten blame for the 13-day-old closure on President Donald Trump and his Republicans.

&gt; The Senate leader has been largely absent from discussions over the shutdown, deferring to the White House after Trump surprised him by rejecting his prior attempts to keep the government open without funding the wall.

&gt; While the first 12 days of the shutdown crept by quietly during the holiday season, Thursday will mark the changing of power in the House, in which the Democrats won a majority of seats in November&amp;#039;s elections, and a new dynamic, with Pelosi again central to moving any legislation through Congress.

"&gt;  Last I heard, the energy equivalent of almost three litres of gas was needed to produce the hydrogen equivalent of ONE litre of gas. That's an energy efficiency rating of less than 40%.

You can't make that comparison. Hydrogen is much less dense than gasoline or diesel, meaning the same volume of hydrogen has much less mass.  

Per kg, hydrogen actually has more than [three times the specific energy of gasoline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#Energy_densities_of_common_energy_storage_materials) and is the fuel with the highest specific energy of any currently viable non-nuclear energy source. This is important, because weight is actually a bigger limiting factor than volume for transportation, since the heavier the vehicle gets, the more fuel you spend to accelerate and overcome friction.  

Now the actual numbers for hydrogen cars won't be exactly that, since they actually are electric vehicles that use a hydrogen fuel cell to generate extra power to increase their range, and there's some loss in the step of generating electricity with a fuel cell.

So the rich and powerful no longer have to bear the poor or less-educated having access to the same privileges, goods and services that they have (and consider their right to have), much less the sight of them at restaurants or entertainment venues only the higher-scores have access to.

"Fascism derives from ultranationalism. You are asserting characteristics associated with authoritarianism (or trying to and ultimately failing).

There's nothing wrong with Canadian crown corporations (Canada Post being a prime example, which very few Canadians would ever support privatizing). Moreover, the government already looked for private buyers for the Trans Mountain Pipeline and none were forthcoming. There's also no central economic planning. The fact that there's a Crown corporation says nothing to that end. Indeed, for you to have a viable argument, you'd need to make a case that Trudeau has nationalised several aspects of the Canadian economy (which is false).

Additionally, most Canadians did in fact support the pipeline expansion. 
https://www.globalnews.ca/news/4180482/majority-of-canadians-support-trans-mountain-pipeline-expansion-ipsos-poll/amp/

Polls show Canadians were split on the purchase, but opposition and support was equal.

https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/canadians-are-split-on-trudeaus-pipeline-purchase-poll-shows

So rather than allowing the pipeline (which most Canadians supported) fail, the government went with the only available option and nationalised it (which had as much support as it had opposition). This also only happened after multiple efforts to find alternative solutions.

https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-morneau-buys-a-pipeline-and-puts-trudeaus-government-on-the-line/

For him to be a legitimate fascist, the moment a court issued the following ruling: https://www.nationalobserver.com/2018/08/30/news/court-quashes-trudeaus-approval-trans-mountain-pipeline

He would have gone ahead with it anyway without using the decision as a guideline for a legal way forward. Your assertions are predicated on a flagrant misconception of whar constitutes fascism and a glaring degree of ignorance regarding Canadian politics and policy.

So I reiterate my regret that the education system has failed you so thoroughly.

Edit: also, to add, natonalising anything has nothing to do with fascism. While nationalising industry is a component in fascism, not all instances are therefore fascism. Even when it arguably ""goes against the will of the people"" (which, as noted, this did not).

Edit 2:

No idea why I didn't just lead with this since you supplied it but...

&gt;Fascist regimes have these seven characteristics:

&gt;Usurpation: The state overtakes and merges with corporate power and sometimes the church.

This is as close as you ever get, but as noted above, you falter thoroughly.

&gt;Nationalism: Leaders appeal to a nostalgic wish to return to an earlier golden age. That can include a return to a simple, virtuous pastoral life. 

Clearly does not apply to Trudeau. Absolutely applies to Trump.

&gt;Militarism: They glorify military strength through propaganda.

Does not apply to Trudeau. Absolutely applies to Trump.

&gt;Father Figure: The leader assumes the role of the father of the nation. He creates a cult status as a ""dauntless ruler beholden to no one."" 

Does not apply to Trudeau. Trump tries with his cult of personality rallies but he only appeals to a minority of the population. Still troubling that he espouses it as much as he can.

&gt;Mass Appeal: The leader claims that the people, manifested as the state, can achieve anything. If they don't succeed, it's because of naysayers, minority groups and saboteurs.

Not Trudeau.  The final sentence is absolutely Trump. You barely need to try to find his myriad attempts to blame everything on everyone else.

&gt;Government Surveillance: The government takes an active role in suppressing dissent. It rewards people who report on each other.

Not Trudeau and, to the best of anyone's awareness to date, not Trump either. He uses tactics to suppress dissent (Trump) but so far hasn't attempted to use the government itself to that end.


&gt;Persecution: The state violently persecutes minority groups and opponents.

"1. China isn't a democracy. Service economies are reliant on a certain kind of person to work in them. This person is middle class, well educated, with disposable income themselves, and freedom. China is a brutal dictatorship, one which doesn't want too much growth in the middle class (despite the talk about it, most of China still lives in poverty. Only a few hundred million, which isn't too many in a country of 1.3 billion, on the coast have significantly benefited), can't allow high quality education as that would mean less government control, will always have lower wages, and of course hate freedom. The people of China are simply not sufficiently quipped to form a service economy, and never will be if things keep going the way they are. 

2. China isn't creative. You know how joke about China stealing all their designs from the West? Well that same joke existed for Japan in the mid 20th century. Going back to the 1890s, Japan started buying up Western designed tech and reverse engineering it to train their local industries. This would lead to them building a gigantic war machine before the Allies sunk it to the bottom of the ocean, but they did the same for their civilian sector after WW2. Cars are a great example, they went from being called 'Jap Crap' to now being famous as some of the most reliable cars around. The same has recently occurred in South Korea. China isn't doing this though, they aren't using all that stolen stuff to improve their own industries. Instead they believe they can simply keep stealing forever and ever, never investing in any innovative or creative new ideas. 

3. Chinese growth is slowing. China is currently going through the early stages of a stagnation. Manufacturing is moving to India, Vietnam, and other South or South East Asian countries. Their attempts to diversify have fallen flat, and they cannot innovate. ",worldnews

The US is in no way perfect and has fucked a lot of things up over the years (i.e. Iraq, Bush, Trump, etc.), but their military power has provided protection to western nations for decades. That protection in turn has allowed us to spend more on social programs and less on defence.

&gt; Evidence gathered by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, was obtained by Russians and leaked online in an attempt to discredit his inquiry into Moscow&amp;#039;s interference in US politics, prosecutors said on Wednesday.

&gt; Mueller&amp;#039;s court filing on Wednesday said the names and structure of folders containing the leaked files matched those used by Mueller&amp;#039;s office when it shared the data, and that these had not been made public.

&gt; Mueller disclosed the leak in a filing as part of his prosecution of Concord Management and Consulting, a Russian company that allegedly funded hacking operations by Russia&amp;#039;s notorious Internet Research Agency.

People talk about a loss of influence but still today it is one of the most influential countries n the world and if you call UK lacking influence then 99% of countries has no relevance 

UK is still the most relevant european nation and has seen higher growth and investment  than both France and Germany even with he uncertainty  of brexit and has been the leader of innovation especially in tech in Europe by a very large distance

Still put them as a top 5 economy by 2050 


France is in massive turmoil and needs reform, Brazil has gone backwards and india  will hit a heavy slump due to their populace becoming middle class which traditionally slows down everything 

Germany are efficient but have no signs of being leaders seeing as they don’t bother with tech or innovation and have just sold off a lot  of their national markets to the Chinese most infamously lately   to Huewei and also heavily relies on both Russian gas and oil and is against reforms to many of their industries and are not progressing with the times especially in regards to moving away from fossil fuels

Japan have major problems and with a decreasing populace and old average age they will find it hard to turn around the steady decline they’ve been having as their economy has been falling quite for quite Awhile with also huge debts

Before Nazis got physical with people, they heavily restricted Jewish peoples' rights, where they could live, where they could shop, who they could do business with, etc. If you learn even a little of Jewish history and culture, there are certain aspects of religion that are considered central. Circumcision, keeping the Sabbath, learning Torah, and eating only meat that has been slaughtered in a kosher way are all major examples. Banning shechita, ritual slaughter, is not a minor inconvenient detail. It attacks one of the main tenets of Judaism, and raises fears of which of those major tenets are next in line to be banned. That's why they consider it a huge assault on *religious rights specifically*. Not assault in general. (It's worth noting that one of the major Jewish holidays, Chanukah, is so celebrated because the Greeks were launching a wholesale assault on specifically those tenets- they didn't let Jews do Bris Milah, learn Torah, eat kosher, and keep Shabbos- and the Jews won a religious victory over them, more than a physical one.)",worldnews

"A lot of misunderstanding and bad translation here. 

Both Taiwan ( Republic of China) and China (People’s Republic of China) maintain and always have maintained there is one “China” the difference lies in what the interpretation of what “China” means. Both PRC and ROC maintains they are the rightful China. Yes, Taiwan’s ROC  technically claims mainland as part of their rightful land but no one in two generations has considered reconquering mainland to be a sane idea; however,  China(PRC) is actively trying to push unification.

The previous agreement is to agree on having one “China” but leaving ambiguity on the interpretation so both sides can stop fighting over politics and have trade relations. This policy is called 一中各表(One China, Each side express their own interpretation ).

The new thing Xi is pushing is called 一國兩制（one COUNTRY, two systems) Crucially, he used the word COUNTRY, implying there is only one government but Taiwan will be a PROVENCE with special treatment - just like Hong Kong, Macau, or Puerto Rico for USA.

Xi’s move represented a renewed wave of aggressive unification stance as he even said in a speech that 武統, or martial unification(aka military invasion), is not out of the question.

This aggressiveness has energized the true independence movement where Taiwan will cease to maintain itself as the rightful “China” but as a completely separate NATION(right now its the same cultural nation but different country like north and South Korea). The percentage of people “not for independence” are mostly just people who still view themselves as Han Chinese culturally.

"Horse has bolted.

We're isolated, don't have nuclear infrastructure, and even countries that do see [multi-decade long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinkley_Point_C_nuclear_power_station#Construction_work) build times. Nuclear is not economical without subsidies today, more expensive than wind, and decades from now by the time the first are online we'd be scratching our heads wondering what the hell they were thinking. And unlike renewables, they also do not produce power until that time.

By ""without subsidies"" - either refer the concessions made to Hinkley, or consider that all plants require at a minimum that the government limits their liability in case of catastrophe.

Why does nuclear require capped liability? Because never mind Chernobyl (which consumed a [significant percentage](http://chernobyl.undp.org/spanish/otherdoc/fallout.htm) of the whole state's budget for years), the $188bn price tag of a single [Fukushima](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tepco-fukushima-costs/japan-nearly-doubles-fukushima-disaster-related-cost-to-188-billion-idUSKBN13Y047) is one of those numbers that just cannot really be interpreted by humans.

How about rolling out 200 odd GW of solar power for the same dollars - some 40x more than Fukushima ever put out.

Honestly, I _was_ a nuclear supporter. I thought through the 90s, renewables were an infeasible hippy dream, and that the world should have been rolling out nuclear. I still wish we had, back then.

You cant just have wide areas of the border unprotected, because you get what we have now which is 100's of people crossing at remote crossings. My BA is in CJ and I have an MBA. So Ive done a lot of research on these topics over the years.

You are correct more illegal immigrants overstay their visas. I wont dispute that. However, we do know about half a million - 1 million illegal immigrants cross at the Mexican border each year. At 10 billion that would put the cost of the wall at 10,000-20,000 per person. Exponentially with every year that goes down. So compare that with the cost of 100 billion that US taxpayers have to pay per year for illegals and it honestly really does make sense to build a wall as a deterrence measure.      


Honestly most Trump supporters are simply annoyed with constantly being called stupid and then seeing democratic leaders say stuff like immigration isn't a big issue. 

Both of my GF's parents are from Mexico (Both voted for Trump) and I have legal and illegal friends. Personally I think the compromise should be legalize everyone who graduated hs here and in exchange get funding for the wall. I have no issue with dreamers. With that said, I live in Southern California and I can tell you I have negatively been impacted by illegal immigration and the topic has caused separation between those in my gf's family who came over Mexico. Living in a predominantly Spanish area.... you would actually be surprised by the amount of older Hispanic people that agree with Trump.

"Franklin had an interesting approach to all this. In the taxation system he proposed, the State came up the same $X per head (no property or income tax). So to maintain consistent taxes, that'd be $10,000 per head for the US. The reason he wanted this was to *prevent* slavery, even though the rich would pay hardly nothing in taxes. Why?

Because by charging the State per head, anytime an individual couldn't pay in full the deficit was thrown on to their employer. Thus, there becomes a tremendous incentive to enhance labor output (saves employer on taxes). This was designed to make holding slaves unaffordable, forcing employers to better educate their workers.",worldnews
"&gt; The U.S. has one of the highest top marginal corporate income tax rate in the G7. You are simplifying this either because you're ignorant of the relative tax policies of the developed world, or you're an ideologue pushing an agenda.

I wasn't talking about corporate tax rates, I was talking about personal income tax rates.  It is difficult to compare these things because tax codes are so complex in most countries and the actual rate itself isn't always exactly what you pay.  But even with that in mind, America's income tax rates are pretty significantly lower than those in Western European nations by many metrics.  For example, here's a source that gives two figures: one for single, childless, average earners and one for married couples with one income and two children.

https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/countries-highest-income-taxes/

By both metrics, the difference between the highest taxed countries (most of which are western European nations) and America is pretty signficiant.  For both metrics U.S. earners pay a bit more than half of what their European counterparts pay.  That's still a pretty significant difference.

&gt; The most obvious example is the cost of healthcare. Average Americans pay far more per capita in healthcare than a European, Canadian or Australian ever will

You're absolutely right, average Americans pay more than Europeans, Canadians, and Australians.  However, the healthiest Americans pay significantly less than the healthiest Euros/Canucks/Aussies because healthy people don't require much medical treatment and those people aren't forced to shoulder the burden for others.  I personally have worked it out for myself before and I pay approximately $8,000 less per year than a Canadian with my same pay and same life situation. Once again this reinforces my point that America is a better place to live for the intelligent and the driven, since these people also tend to be much healthier.  And likewise if you are lazy and don't bother to take care of your health, Europe is a better place to live since others are forced to pay for your treatments.

&gt; Denmark, Norway, Finland, Canada, Australia, Sweden, New Zealand, Germany, Spain, France and Switzerland all have far higher class mobility than the U.S. according to research from the Economic Policy Institute.

So what?  There are so, so many people in the world who have a severe lack of critical thinking skills.  I'm not surprised in the least that social mobility is low in America because most people don't bother to think their life choices through properly and so they end up poor.  That's not a flaw in the American system, that's a flaw with people.  The only reason that social mobility in some of those countries is higher is because you can move up in society by doing nothing.  For example, in America if you want free college you have to earn it via scholarships.  You have to be among the best of the best, and if you are then you're rewarded for it with free higher education.  In Norway you don't have to do diddly squat, they just pay your college tuition for you simply because you exist.

But here's the thing.  In America if you can get one of those full ride scholarships then you can get your college degree for free.  And even better, after you graduate and start working you don't have to start paying for everyone else's education via taxes.  You just get to keep the money.  In Norway, you could be the brightest most hardworking student in your high school class and it doesn't matter - your opportunity remains identical to the class clown who goofed off the whole year.  You are still both entitled to free college.

Again, America is best for the bright and hardworking, Europe is best for the lazy and the stupid.

&gt; The U.S. benefitted massively from the genocide and slavery of native people across the world

Oh yeah, colonial Europeans would *never* do something like this......

You're right about WWII though - it did benefit the U.S. massively.  There's more to the story than just that explanation though.

&gt; You've fallen behind and the trend will only continue

One opinion piece on startup culture in silicon valley does not mean that American tech is falling behind.  Wake me up when a non-American CPU or GPU manufacturer starts taking over.

&gt; Yet the GDP of the EU is only 1 trillion off from the U.S.? If you add Norway or Switzerland to the equation however, the GDP soars past the U.S., does that not indicate to you that people work hard in Europe, and that maybe your perception of the world is so deeply controlled by propaganda?

The population of the EU is also approximately 58% larger than that of the U.S.  Given that fact, the similar GDP isn't terribly impressive.  With a smaller population, we produce similar amounts of value as the much larger EU population produces.  And it makes perfect sense too.  When the government wants people to smoke less, or drink less, or eat less sugar, what do they do?  They tax it because taxes provide a disincentive for engaging in that sort of activity.  Income tax is a tax on labor - why would you think it works any different?

&gt; That individualistic, and aggressive mindset is why no sane person would leave another developed country for the U.S.

Yeah, tell that to my British, German, Japanese, and South Korean co-workers who I see every day of the week.  Take one look at this [source](https://www.daxx.com/blog/development-trends/it-salaries-software-developer-trends-2018) and it should be abundantly clear why they came to America.

&gt; why the youth are turning to the likes of AOC and Sanders

Oh c'mon, appealing to the wisdom of teenagers?  Of course teenagers want free college - seems like they'd be the primary beneficiaries of it.  What about all the people who had to pay for their own college expenses - they shouldn't be forced to pay for it a second time in the form of increased lifelong taxes.

Anyway, to sum it all up I never said that America is the best place to live for the ""average"" human.  I said it's the best place to live for our best and brightest.  I still stand by that, and furthermore I think that's the way things should be.  The people who contribute the most to society deserve to have better lives than the people who contribute the least.  Anyone can make it in America - you just have to be willing to work your ass off and you have to have the critical thinking skills to make smart life decisions.  Do both of those things and you're set.  But most people can't or won't do those things.  They'd be better off migrating to Europe, and I'd be happy to see them go.",worldnews

Yes, because the all-important precondition, namely an open shooting war, isn't met. In such a circumstance, every single interaction with the enemy is treason, including tourism, business and possibly even family visits. It would be a circus of prosecutions. More importantly, you'd have to ""retroactively"" declare an active shooting war, when there actually wasn't one, suddenly ensnaring millions of Americans who have interacted with Russians or the Russian Federation for the most innocuous of reasons, from tourism to regular commerce in ""treason"" charges. The single most important thing one can and should expect from a legal system is that you can actually *know* when you're committing a crime, and that you can't have been doing something perfectly legal and then have that deemed illegal retroactively. 

You have no notion whatsoever of what being able to invoke treason actually entails.

&gt; For those still reading along

Did you type all this while winking at yourself in the mirror or what?

&gt; For those still reading along, let's focus on the crux of most of these OP-EDs

You mean that every single author of every single essay cited is infinitely more qualified to assess what the meaning of the term ""Enemy"" entails than you are? I agree.

&gt; The whole ""no war, no treason"" argument goes back to ""settled law"" at the time of Aaron Burr's trial and the trials of those who acted with him

The Burr trial considered the meaning and interpretation of ""levying war"" not the scope of the term ""Enemy"". It was explicitly decided that what was required was an ""actual assembling of men for the treasonable purpose, to constitute a levying of war"", inspired by the SCOTUS decision under Ex Parte Bollman, part of the same Burr conspiracy, whereas a defintion of ""Enemy"" can be found under United States v. Greathouse.

Swing and a miss.

&gt; That's the very early 1800s, by the way...

This remark is as meaningless in a legal context as it gets, and chronological snobbery at best.

More aimless intellectually incontinent logorrhea.

&gt; If there's ever been a 200+year-old Supreme Court precedent worth revisiting, it's this one!

&gt; I could go on and on talking about the subject

...But you shouldn't, because people who actually know law already have, and they think you're wrong.

&gt; “...enemies are defined very precisely under American treason law. An enemy is a nation or an organization with which the United States is in a declared or open war. Nations with whom we are formally at peace, such as Russia, are not enemies.”

&gt; ""Here the word “enemies” means nations with which we are at war. We are not currently at war with Russia, and therefore one cannot commit treason by aiding Russia, even if the aid meant swaying the 2016 presidential election.""

&gt; Whatever one thinks of Russia, Vladimir Putin, or the current state of relations between it/them and the United States, we are not at war with Russia. Full stop. Russia is therefore not an “enemy” of the United States. Full stop. Collaborating with Russia is a serious allegation, and may violate other federal laws. But treason is something very special, unique, and specific under U.S. law...

&gt; ...there is no such thing as a “quasi-enemy” under American treason law.  If Russia was an enemy in June 2016, it was an enemy for all purposes.  That would mean that any provision of aid and comfort to Russia by any person owing allegiance to the United States was not just illegal, but treason, a capital crime.  Any person advising a Russian business, any lawyer representing Russian interests, any person registered as an agent for Russia, perhaps even someone doing an interview on Russian television— all would be equally guilty of treason.  The suggestion is absurd, but that is the logical consequence of accepting Russia as an enemy under our treason law. 

-Carlton F.W. Larson, ""[Russia and 'Enemies' under the Treason Clause](https://takecareblog.com/blog/russia-and-enemies-under-the-treason-clause)""

&gt; ""If 'enemy' simply means a country whose government makes efforts to damage U.S. national interests, then whether someone is a “traitor” becomes a mere question of opinion (or, as Talleyrand said, 'just a matter of dates'). Anyone working in tandem with a foreign government might find himself charged with treason. The absolute rock-bottom principle of criminal law in a free society has to be that it’s possible to know whether one is or is not breaking the law, and that it’s not possible to become a criminal retrospectively when Oceania goes to war with Eastasia.""

&gt; ""The Treason Clause applies only to disloyal acts committed during times of war. Acts of dis-loyalty during peacetime are not considered treasonous under the Constitution. Nor do acts of Espionage committed on behalf of an ally constitute treason.

Ironically, China's own premier has previously said he's far from confident in the country's GDP estimates, calling them ""man-made"" and unreliable, according to a leaked document from 2007 obtained by WikiLeaks. He said government data releases, especially the GDP numbers, should be used ""for reference only.""

For example, Government has an airport and a military base in Qamishlo and al-Hasakah, they are surrounded by Kurdish controlled territory, but there is no blockade of those territories and government is free to use them and resupply them. Similarly during battle of Aleppo, Syrian government protected Kurdish controlled part of it - Sheikh Maqsood. Again it is currently surrounded by government controlled territory but there is no blockade or any kind of fighting between them. 

Russian airforce also helped SDF to capture Tell Rifaat, which under the pressure from Turkey was then put under joint Russian/Kurdish control.

"They are just not the same.

Basically people started protesting because Macron removed the ISF (solidarity tax on  fortune) which benefited France  4,39 billions €/y.
It was however an ""expensive"" tax, as 2.13% of the gains were used to enforce the tax. The move was mitigated by creating a IFI (tax on real estate fortune) seen as less ""unfair"" for the rich and which was supposed to be both cheaper and less scary for foreign and domestic investment. The predicted gain is 1 billion €.
In the same time, Macron increased the CSG (general social contribution) on retirements benefits (from 7.5% to 9.2%). It is highly impopular as it basically means less retirement money. Retirement is a very delicate subject in France and Sarkozy's (continued by Hollande's) decisions on the matter made ""old"" french (40-70yo) very wary. This CSG increase was seen as another stab in the back.

Then comes the ultimate straw on the back of the camel : the diesel tax. Diesel and other fuels are already highly taxed in France. The 10 points hike made diesel 0,076€ more expensive per litre. At the end of the day, 62% of the price of diesel are taxes. This diesel tax will cost the average french driving diesel car between 35 and 50€.

This is the ""enough unfair tax"" part of the movement.

Now the next part ""enough road restriction"" : road related protest are extremely common in France. During Hollande's term, an ""ecotax"" was created. This tax was made to discourage the use of truck in favor of trains. They consisted in gates monitoring how many kilometers you make and send you a bill at the end. This led to a revolt known as the ""red bonnets"" and they destroyed for 6 million € worth of gates. In the same vein, automatic speed radar as seen as unfair. They are also seen as a disguised tax. Few people trust them. I know many of my relatives who believe that they are ""fake"", ""rigged"" and also send fines to speed respectful drivers (hint : no).
This demographic is not really concerned about pollution, global warming and stuff. They don't have the strong denial seen in the US, but they prefer to blame others (China, the US...) and/or minimize their impact.

All these things (and many others I can't elaborate for the sake of brevity) led to the Gilet Jaune (yellow vest) movement.

Also, some people, mostly left oriented, don't care as much about this road stuff, and while concerned by the tax hikes, are more angry about both tax cut on the rich and ""inaction"" on battling climate change. Not all of these protesters are seen as allies by the ecologists protesters.
Most of them are probably the same highly motivated activists fighting for climate and environment since the 80s. They mainly oppose multinational companies or big french companies (Bayer/Monsanto, Total, Vinci, Nuclear energy companies), political corruption, and political complaisance with environment harming companies when money is at stake.
Some of their fights include :
- Protesting against GMO, McDonalds (one of their leaders, Jose Bove, went in jail for destroying one restaurant, and also cannot go to Canada and US)
- Protesting and occupying an allegedly illegal dam building site in a wetland (Sivens dam) resulting in the death of one protester.
- Protesting against an allegedly illegal airport (Notre Dame des Landes Airport), resulting in a 48 years long occupation.
This core of protester is probably joined by the youth, who are quite concerned by the environment in France and some other people who consider environment and climate an important thing.

"&gt; it sounds somewhat contradictory if someone insists that they are male, despite not having a dick or a 'y' chromosome, but then get pregnant and give birth

I’m sorry if that sounds contradictory to you and it’s certainly outside of the norm, but “it’s weird” is not a good enough justification for sterilizing people.

&gt; also i wouldn't expect very many gender changers would actually WANT to have those organs they wish they hadn't been born with, functioning

Yeah, that is pretty accurate to how I feel as a trans person. But not all trans people want lower surgery. Surgery is inherently risky and medical science has advanced a lot but it’s far from perfect. Phalloplasty for trans men involves removing all the skin from one of your forearms. Not everyone is comfortable with that sort of thing.

Also, these surgeries are very expensive. By the time a person can afford SRS(if they ever can) they will likely have been otherwise fully transitioned for years. At that point it’s probably unnecessary to keep using the wrong gender marker for them.

&gt;HOWEVER i could see how it would cause issues down the track if they are cured of their dysmorphia and want to resume living as the gender they were born with, if they are sterile

That’s certainly an edge case. How about the more common scenario of a trans person who wants to have biological children. Or who can’t afford surgery but has otherwise completely transitioned and has to deal with being outed to anyone who sees their ID or paperwork.

Also, small thing. It’s dysphoria, not dysmorphia. They’re very different conditions even though the names are similar.",worldnews

"&gt;I'm not sure where you got your information, but Irish immigrant communities are some of the best-recorded examples of the use of blackface as a transformative medium.

First of all, I'm not sure how an article suggesting **Irish-Americans** engaged in minstrel shows refutes my point that **Irish immigrants** did not and probably would not because a lack of cultural understanding. The distinction between Irish-Americans and Irish migrants is an important one, namely that only one of those groups are American.

&gt;Irish and WASP performers would both perform in it

You're right, names like Thomas Dartmouth Rice, Charles Mathews, George Washington Dixon, and Edwin Forrest all sound really Irish. I've never heard more Irish names.

Again, I'm not disputing that Irish immigrants attended minstrel shows or that many of them were racist towards African Americans (though also more understanding in some regards due to living aside them and facing racism themselves), but you're desire to pin the blame for minstrelsy on immigrants is nonsensical and cowardly. As I've said, most of them would not have understood the cultural references (or even the language in a lot of cases). Minstrel shows were a form of American entertainment created for Americans,.

"""We"" are not the bad guys. I am not part of any such ""we"" and I'm not going to be. Even if someone forces me to pay tax to support it, the blame for that lies on those taking the money from me, not on me.

&amp;#x200B;

But also bear this in mind: the idea that in every conflict there are ""the good guys"" and ""the bad guys"" is mostly true only in fiction. In movies and video games there are almost always ""the good guys"" and ""the bad guys"". In real life, if one side does something wrong or a lot of things wrong, they may no longer qualify as very ""good"". But that does not by any means make the other side ""the good guys"". Movies and other stories about real historical events also generally portray conflicts between ""the good guys"" and ""the bad guys"", but that is mostly propaganda and fiction with a historical setting. Yes, there are some cases where it's pretty much true, such as the armed resistance in the Warsaw Ghetto against the Nazis, but in most cases, neither side is even close to being completely moral.

&amp;#x200B;

Most large, intense conflicts in the world today, and in earlier times in history, are not between ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"". They are between competing groups of people who are all usually making at least a few extremely unethical moves to gain money, power and/or victory in the conflict. Usually a lot more than a few.

Power tends to corrupt people. The US government is abusing its power largely because it has so much power. Other countries are also abusing their power and if they had as much power as the US does now, I cannot name a single government I could be sure would not abuse that power in a similar or worse way.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure what, if anything, can solve this problem. Voting different people into office doesn't seem to work very well. Moving to another country might get you away from the problem, but it doesn't solve it. If the US ever got to the point where it didn't have much power, other countries would then dominate the world and if we ever live to see that happen, when we see what the others do with their power, we might wish the US was still the dominant power. I don't know what could be done about any of this, but I'm open to suggestions.

Everything I’ve seen through my adult life seems to show the opposite, tbh. Bush lied and republicans conspired to get us into stupid wars where our friends died for no reason. We support reprehensible countries all over the world because it benefits us and often even worse things would happen if we didn’t. A huge proportion of the country scoffs at knowledge and science and doesn’t have the ethics or decency to not vote for an obviously incompetent, compulsively lying, traitorous con artist. A person anyone should be able to look at and know that they’re an objectively disgusting sample of humanity, yet so many want that person to represent them and their beliefs. Federal courts are now controlled by republicans (and it’s not going to change for decades) who support legalized bribery, opposing the rights of minorities and lgbt people, destroying the environment, and fucking over regular people for the benefit of businesses and the rich. 

Over the years there will be tons of evidence of trump’s crimes but nothing will be done because of his office and the fact republicans will block everything. Everyone who is prosecuted will get a slap on the wrist or pardons. Trump will leave office but his family will retain a lot of influence and he still won’t be prosecuted because there will be new scumbag republicans to oppose and attacking an old senile man will be distracting and look bad. He’ll be proof that any scum can rise to the highest offices, and along with the fact bribery is essentially legal we’ll have even worse candidates to chose from in our already unrepresentative corporatocracy. Might even have a president donald trump jr. in twenty years or so. Democrats will probably gain some more influence but be unable to do anything major because the courts will block anything progressive, and will likely have some shitty candidates as well.

Although all this is probably foolishly optimistic - I would have never guessed our government would be this disgustingly unethical, incompetent and corrupt five years ago so I’m probably not even thinking of all the terrible things which will happen in our race to the bottom. Because really, while we look at the current administration with disgust, it’s really many Americans and humans who are the vile source. Old people who die get replaced with more crotchety xenophobic old people, religious nutjobs spawn and indoctrinate more religious nutjobs, and ignorant y’all qaeda shun knowledge and stay ignorant. And as long as they live in the right place they’ll still be able to control the government regardless of the majority opposing them.

Older Chinese folks who were well educated/traveled had to speak like 8 different dialects to get around which is not really a reasonable thing for most people to be able to learn.

I actually think of all the dialects of China, Cantonese is actually one of the least threatened. Many of the other dialects never had a formal phoneticization system created for it so it's almost impossible to learn these dialects from texts. Cantonese at least has actual texts that help people learn it, but the vast majority of the hundreds of remaining Chinese dialects have no such guides so unless you were born into a family that still speaks it there's no reliable way to learn and preserve the language.

"Yeah, I'm gonna trust the following sources as opposed to some random guy on reddit:

**[Harvard Medical School](http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/becoming-a-vegetarian)**

* *Traditionally, research into vegetarianism (*see context*) focused mainly on potential nutritional deficiencies, but in recent years, the pendulum has swung the other way, and studies are confirming the health benefits of meat-free eating. Nowadays, plant-based eating is recognized as not only nutritionally sufficient but also as a way to reduce the risk for many chronic illnesses.*

**[British Dietetic Association](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/vegetarianfoodfacts.pdf)**

* *Well planned vegetarian diets (*see context*) can be nutritious and healthy. They are associated with lower risks of heart disease, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain cancers and lower cholesterol levels. This could be because such diets are lower in saturated fat, contain fewer calories and more fiber and phytonutrients/phytochemicals (these can have protective properties) than non-vegetarian diets. (...) Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of life and have many benefits.*

**[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27886704/)**

* *It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan, diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. These diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, older adulthood, and for athletes.*

**[Dietitians of Canada](https://www.dietitians.ca/Downloads/Factsheets/Guidlines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

* *A healthy vegan diet can meet all your nutrient needs at any stage of life including when you are pregnant, breastfeeding or for older adults.*

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

* *With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.*

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](https://www.nutrition.org.uk/healthyliving/helpingyoueatwell/veganandvegetarian.html)**

* *Well planned vegetarian and vegan diets can be nutritious and healthy ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.*

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](https://daa.asn.au/smart-eating-for-you/smart-eating-fast-facts/healthy-eating/vegan-diets-facts-tips-and-considerations/)**

* *Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. With good planning, those following a vegan diet can cover all their nutrient bases, but there are some extra things to consider.*

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/tips-vegetarians)**

* *Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.*

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/file/publications/n55_australian_dietary_guidelines1.pdf)**

* *Appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthy and nutritionally adequate. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the lifecycle. Those following a strict vegetarian or vegan diet can meet nutrient requirements as long as energy needs are met and an appropriate variety of plant foods are eaten throughout the day*

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

"From the DA that handled that case:

&gt;**The facts appear be that PETA was asked to help when an adjacent landowner reported that they should see how his cow with her udders ripped up from abandoned and stray dogs in the trailer park area amounted to a menace not to be tolerated. He complained to PETA that the abandoned and stray dogs attacked his livestock, injured his milking cow, killed his goat and terrorized his rabbits. Abandoned and/or stray dogs and cats have appeared to have been considerable in what is known as Dreamland** 2. PETA responded and the trailer park management encouraged their efforts in an attempt to gather stray/abandoned cats and dogs. Additionally the leases provided that no dogs were allowed to run free in the trailer park.

&gt;Approximately three weeks before Mr. Cerate’s dog [Maya] was taken by the women associated with PETA, Mr. Cerate asked if they would put traps under his trailer to catch some of the wild cats that were in the trailer park, and traps were provided to him as requested. Additionally, parties associated with PETA provided Mr. Cerate with a dog house for two other dogs that were tethered outside of Mr. Cerate’s home.

&gt;On or about October 18 a van that was operated by the ladies associated with PETA arrived the at the trailer park. The van was clearly marked PETA and in broad daylight arrived gathering up what abandoned stray dogs and cats could be gathered. **Among the animals gathered was the Chihuahua of Mr. Cerate. Unfortunately the Chihuahua wore no collar, no license, no rabies tag, nothing whatsoever to indicate the dog was other than a stray or abandoned dog. It was not tethered nor was it contained. Other animals were also gathered. Individuals living in the trailer park were present and the entire episode was without confrontation. Mr. Cerate was not at home and the dog was loose, sometimes entering the shed/porch or other times outside in the trailer park before he was put in the van and carried from the park. The dogs owned by Mr. Cerate that were tethered were not taken.**

&gt;Whether one favors or disfavors PETA has little to do with the decision of criminality. The issue is whether there is evidence that the two people when taking the dog believed they were taking the dog of another or whether they were taking an abandoned and/or stray animal. There have been no complaints on the other animals taken on that same day, and, like the Chihuahua, [they] had no collar or tag.

What does all this mean? Well, first you let the legit hitman hirer go by, then a wave of last ditch attempts are made based on this ruling.

"Well, longstanding policy has it that the United States administration [does not support Taiwanese independence and at least de facto subscribes to the One China doctrine.](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35855.htm)

&gt;	U.S.-TAIWAN RELATIONS
The United States and Taiwan enjoy a robust unofficial relationship. The 1979 U.S.-P.R.C. Joint Communique switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. In the Joint Communique, the United States recognized the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. The Joint Communique also stated that the people of the United States will maintain cultural, commercial, and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan. The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) is responsible for implementing U.S. policy toward Taiwan.
The United States does not support Taiwan independence. Maintaining strong, unofficial relations with Taiwan is a major U.S. goal, in line with the U.S. desire to further peace and stability in Asia. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act provides the legal basis for the unofficial relationship between the United States and Taiwan, and enshrines the U.S. commitment to assist Taiwan in maintaining its defensive capability. The United States insists on the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait differences, opposes unilateral changes to the status quo by either side, and encourages both sides to continue their constructive dialogue on the basis of dignity and respect.

While this is both a hollow commitment and diplomatic window dressing to either side of this quagmire, an invasion by Beijing irl would have disastrous consequences for international relations, regional stability, the global economy and so forth. 

The fact is based on a different trajectory, however. The Chinese administration is looking once again to shift the goal posts a tiny bit. Bit by bit. The time is highly convenient because of lacking leadership at the very top of US administration. 

This comment will probably end in a downvote train for known reasons, as it happens when you piss off all parties at the table. 

In any event, the Chinese administration is a master of moving the goal posts and thus make any subsequent attempts to make a discount look like a benevolent gesture of restraint. Simultaneously, the Chinese administration -probably correctly- anticipates that the U.S. is on balance unlikely to cause serious military headache. Diplomatic headache, probably. 

Nothing to fear, nothing to see, carry on. The chunk has been biten off. What’s left is a little tiny bit less dramatic to repossess. Moving on.

My point is that there are different starting points that make an idea like this more feasible in some countries than in others. Korea already has a lot of mass transit use, has a lot of its population in extremely dense urban centers, and Korea just doesn't have the car culture with the huge sprawling cities and suburbs to the extent that the US does. Korea also has mass transit options for getting around the country fairly easily, and the US does not. Korea is making a smaller jump than the US would have to as far as population density and car culture, Korea isn't fighting against the idea that mass transit is kind of shitty (because in a lot of large cities in the US, mass transit is, in fact, kinda shitty so there isn't a lot of existing trust for it), and Koreans are able to travel around other parts of their country without a car much more easily than Americans are.

None of that means that it CAN'T work in the US, but it does mean that copying and pasting the idea that works in Korea and not anticipating that there will be a different set of issues because of the different starting point is incredibly naive. As is saying that the size of the US isn't a factor when talking about switching from car culture to mass transit. Geographic size and distance absolutely do make a difference when talking about transportation. It's like the one issue I can think of where it's actually one of the top considerations.

Its takes longer, but if thats the peace of mind you need, then don't be afraid to ask for it. It also helps to go in with a budget in mind and be upfront with what you can afford. The vet will still offer you the gold standard (more expensive) option, but thats because they have to inform you of all your options. You don't have to take it if you can't afford it.

Just as an example that $650 for 3 X-rays may seem costly but don't forget what you are really paying for is:

* the rent
* the bills (phones, internet, heat, electricity)
* the specialized gear (lead vests, gowns, gloves, glasses)
* the specialized equipment (X-ray machine \~$80-120k) and its maintenance and upkeep
* the specialized program used to process the x-rays (can be tens of thousands in of itself)
* the receptionists, tech assistants, tech, and vets salaries (or in the case of the ER, the doctors, nurses, etc)
* the knowledge and training it took to go into reading those X-rays

and so much more! its actually very surprising that it costs so little for some of these procedures, whats even more amazing is that vet medicine does this at a fraction of the cost of human medicine. Those 3 x-rays at a veterinary clinic might cost you half as much but all the costs going in are about the same (except the salaries).",worldnews

&gt; Yamaguchi Prefecture, where carrier-based aircraft are stationed at the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, also opposed the FCLP. In addition, the United States asked Japan to secure an alternative site because Iwojima island is located 1,400 kilometers from the Iwakuni base, and emergencies in the FCLP would force the aircraft to land in the ocean.

&gt; The fact that this proposal to widen abortion access in Ecuador has made it to the National Assembly is an advancement for pro-abortion activists as the 2014 COIP increased sanctions on women for having or even attempting to have an abortion.

No surprise there, since the Trump administration controls the State Department. Because she is not provably linked directly to any American, you won't see posts about her on /r/politics. Her one big hit from 2017 proved that oligarchs are paying off government officials. She claims to have more dirt, but it was never released or she bartered with Deripaska.

I'll give you the courtesy of assuming you don't actually believe such an arbitrary restriction should be implemented. Because if mental aptitude is the criteria, why not just use IQ tests as the measurement? It's not singling out an individual, it'd be excluding everyone under X intelligence. 

It's the same rationale, but an aptitude test would be way more appropriate than what you suggest, and it would also be pretty unethical.

"This is so fucking ridiculously wrong.

Banks use EVERYBODY’S money to loan out money to people. Rich, poor, middle-class, doesn’t matter.

The difference is that if the middle class has more cash/wealth, then they don’t need to take as many fucking loans.

They don’t need to pay a middle-man (this is defacto the rich guy anyway) 10% interest, thus making themselves even poorer.

"&gt;Another edit: Rich people are rich because they exploit people. To show this let’s look at my iPhone math. Jeff Bezos would have had to work all of the 500000 hours he has been alive at a rate of 264764 dollars an hour. Yeah totally he has done that much work. That wealth should be all his. No wait he can’t possibly have done all that work. If you think he has you’re a fucking dumbass.

Money isn't how much you've worked, it's how much value you've created for others. The fact that you haven't been able to figure that out is probably why you're poor. 

Bill Gates is rich because Window's software created value for billions of people who agreed to exchange a monetary amount equal to the value they felt it added to their life. Bezos is rich because Amazon has added value to businesses who want to sell their products and people who want to purchase them, and that value is worth the 15% + commission businesses pay to Amazon. 

Money is just a standardized unit of value. The more value you create for other people, the more money you have. It has nothing to do with how much you work, although it's easier to provide value to others the more you work. The only caveat is this presumes a competitive environment where you are not prevented from creating value or competing by monopolies, government regulation, corrupt courts, unfair taxes etc., and so on. The answer to wealth inequality is addressing why so many people are so bad at creating any value for society. A good place to start looking is regulations and legal and anti-competitive systems that are keeping these people from creating businesses.  ",worldnews

"The full list of known indictments and plea deals in Mueller’s probe

1) George Papadopoulos, former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, was arrested in July 2017 and pleaded guiltylast October to making false statements to the FBI. He got a 14-day sentence.

2) Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chair, was indicted on a total of 25 different counts by Mueller’s team, related mainly to his past work for Ukrainian politicians and his finances. He had two trials scheduled, and the first ended in a conviction on eight counts of financial crimes. To avert the second trial, Manafort struck a plea deal with Mueller in September 2018 (though Mueller’s team said in November that he breached that agreement by lying to them).

3) Rick Gates, a former Trump campaign aide and Manafort’s longtime junior business partner, was indicted on similar charges to Manafort. But in February he agreed to a plea deal with Mueller’s team, pleading guilty to just one false statements charge and one conspiracy charge.

4) Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, pleaded guiltylast December to making false statements to the FBI.

5-20) 13 Russian nationals and threeRussian companies were indicted on conspiracy charges, with some also being accused of identity theft. The charges related to a Russian propaganda effort designed to interfere with the 2016 campaign. The companies involved are the Internet Research Agency, often described as a “Russian troll farm,” and two other companies that helped finance it. The Russian nationals indicted include 12 of the agency’s employees and its alleged financier, Yevgeny Prigozhin.

21) Richard Pinedo: This California man pleaded guilty to an identity theft charge in connection with the Russian indictments, and has agreed to cooperate with Mueller. He was sentenced to 6 months in prison and 6 months of home detention in October.

22) Alex van der Zwaan: This London lawyer pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Rick Gates and another unnamed person based in Ukraine. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail and has completed his sentence.

23) Konstantin Kilimnik: This longtime business associate of Manafort and Gates, who’s currently based in Russia, was charged alongside Manafort with attempting to obstruct justice by tampering with witnesses in Manafort’s pending case this year.

24-35) 12 Russian GRU officers: These officers of Russia’s military intelligence service were charged with crimesrelated to the hacking and leaking of leading Democrats’ emails in 2016.

36) Michael Cohen: In August, Trump’s former lawyer pleaded guilty to 8 counts — tax and bank charges, related to his finances and taxi business, and campaign finance violations — related to hush money payments to women who alleged affairs with Donald Trump, as part of a separate investigation in New York (that Mueller had handed off). But in November, he made a plea deal with Mueller too, for lying to Congress about efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.

Finally, there is one other person Mueller initially investigated, but handed over to others in the Justice Department to charge: Sam Patten. This Republican operative and lobbyist pleaded guilty to not registering as a foreign agent with his work for Ukrainian political bigwigs, and agreed to cooperate with the government.

Tell me, what exactly has Ivanka accomplished which proves her genius besides winning the genetic lottery of being both a billionaire heiress *and* a legacy student at UPenn? She was born and raised with a silver spoon, had unlimited resources for tutoring, and didn't have to deal with any deprivation growing up. Anything she wanted, including the resources to start any business were all immediately available to her without issue.


Never had to go into debt, never had to take real risks, never had to  sacrifice anything of real value in order to gain something out of her reach, never had to strike out on her own without a safety net without anyone supporting her, things which these men had to do in order to make a name for themselves.



All this and you're trying to say to me that she's ""smarter"" and more accomplished than anyone you or we know? For what, being raised in absolute privilege? Please. A first generation college graduate or any successful entrepreneur out there has better lessons to teach than she ever will.

"It's been touched upon slightly in other-places in this thread but when justice is unsatisfactory the inevitable result is vigilante justice.  Was 11 years warranted?  Apparently someone didn't think so.

Humans have an evolved sense of vengeance and justice.  This is built straight into our psyche.  someone wrongs you you naturally, from tens of thousands of years for evolution want to retaliate.  Our concept of modern law and justice has actually evolved out of this fact in an attempt to civilize an unavoidable part of our human nature.

here is the caveat.  That human nature doesn't magically disappear because a guy in a white wig and a black robe says it should.  Our human nature is not beholden to the thin lattice work of civilized concepts that cage it in.  No.  The lattice work is actually beholden to human nature.  When that latticework fails according to our human nature valuation of ""Vengence"" - this can sometimes be the result.

In recent decades the west has adopted softer and softer positions on ""justice"".  Studies show this, data shows that, recidivism, rehabilitation, forgiveness, etc. etc.  [All fine and dandy, but when you have a molester attacking the offspring of a father human nature doesn't give a shit about the lattice work which is beholden to it, not the other way around.](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/3/texan-who-killed-man-raping-his-daughter-will-not-/)

Whatever is trump's reason for shutting down government, maybe he is scared of a democratic house, one thing is clear, trump is not holding all the cards.

Your theory that it leads to a decreased crime rate ignores the fact that it increases crime.

&gt;That argument also entirely backs the concept of not letting any immigrants in at all, legal or illegal, or for that matter not letting anyone breed. Any new person has the possibility of victimizing someone else, therefore in order to stop all crime, just don't have any people. It's a ludicrous conclusion. If the people coming in are safer than the general population, then the people coming in aren't likely to be the problem.

With immigrants we vet them.  With people that live here we have no option to pick and choose.

With illegals we have no idea who is coming over.

No one believes we can stop all crime.  Or that all crime will be stopped when illegal immigration is under control. Or that illegals commit the most crime in the country.

The comparison of crime rate should be to other immigrants, not citizens.  But even then it ignores the real issue that we just don’t know who is coming over.

&gt;If increased wage competition directly impacts individuals, then increased consumer demand also directly impacts individuals. You can't have it one way, but not the other.

Clearly it impacts someone.  But regular American workers was what was being talked about.

I’m not sure how this visa idea works in stopping criminal illegals from coming over.  You know the problem that we are talking about...

Just documenting ignores the economic impact of the migrants.

I’m not looking for excuses, there are reasons.

They add to crime, there are economic impacts to having them here that are negative to the government, and to everyday people directly.

well, you can't vote to undo the most extreme effects of gerymandering or to get rid of the electoral college. Sure, you could change that through a democratic process by electing representatives that promise to take care of it but it's a task that takes much much more effort and has very slim chances of success. 

The presidential election on the other hand is an established, regular event. So if *there* the majority had voted for Trump one would be justified in saying that American voters have fucked this up. Sure, it's still shocking to see so many people rally behind this piece of garbage but I think it asks a lot of the average voter to undo decades of erosion of democratic institutions.

"Storytime by request. Not exactly the plot you asked for but close. We got 6 chicks from the local Agra store. One ended up being a male meat chicken. Wasnt even a real rooster. At 10 weeks, Angel, the asshole rooster, was almost full grown. He was clearly genetically modified or at least breed to be a chicken dinner. We decided to keep him and piss off the neighbors. We figured he wouldn't last but a few months. By 5 months, he was huge. And could barely walk. Still, he crowed his broken crow. Got it on with his hens. He liked Buttercup best. Ate cracked corn. Bathed in the sun and watched over his girls while they free ranged. Winter was coming. So I built a little shelter under the coop. I worried he wasn't made to handle the cold. And by this time he just hung out in the coop and didn't try to walk. I thought of humane ways to kill him. Cervical dislocation and/or chopping off he's head we're the only two available. Considered calling the vet when I felt he was in too much pain. Last week, my wife found him dead and so the story ends.

&gt; WASHINGTON: Scientists have repurposed the gene-editing tool CRISPR to study which genes are targeted by particular antibiotics, providing clues on how to improve the existing drugs or develop new ones.

&gt; The researchers worked with a defanged form of CRISPR known as CRISPRi which has been engineered to be unable to cut DNA.Instead, it just sits on the DNA, blocking other proteins from gaining access to and turning on a particular gene.

&gt; The researchers showed that if they decreased the amount of protein targeted by an antibiotic, bacteria became much more sensitive to lower levels of the drug - evidence of an association between gene and drug.

Until the destruction of the Middle East by imperialist Western forces and anti-Islam propaganda following 9/11 (which was a reaction to US war crimes, not a religious thing), Islam was indeed associated with peace. There is a reason why it's called that historically, you know?

It was literally renown for being a religion without terrorism (which made it contrast with Christianity and Judaism, which were known for their massive problems with terrorism). Until WWII Islam was revered for its strict adherance to its principles and creating a peaceful, homogenous society (i.e. what right wing voters everywhere want). Hitler himself was a big admirer of Islam, as - unlike other religion - it was relying on strict faith among populations and its ideological homogeneity without requiring terrorism or violent oppression to bring people in line.

&gt; LONDON - Two of the biggest donors to the Brexit campaign say they now believe the project they championed will eventually be abandoned by the government and the United Kingdom will stay in the European Union.

&gt; Peter Hargreaves, the billionaire who was the second biggest donor to the 2016 leave campaign, and veteran hedge fund manager Crispin Odey told Reuters they expect Britain to stay in the EU despite their campaign victory in the 2016 referendum.

&gt; Marshall predicted the most likely outcome is that Britain will leave the EU without a deal in March, or the government will secure a revised Brexit deal, solving the thorny issue of the Northern Irish backstop, which may involve Brexit being briefly delayed.

Germany (at least their representatives) recognizes it will have step up its game (by [2024](https://www.factcheck.org/2018/07/trump-still-distorting-nato-spending/)).

That said it does not view the military as a sort of multi-tool for fixing everything (and has much less trust in it than the US - not surprisingly really). Secondly Germany sees a lump sum spending target as really dumb.

For example this ignores:

1. Russia only spends a minute fraction of this
2. EU transfer payments to countries such as Poland or the Baltics (or selling loads of tanks to Poland for a pittance)
3. Having a very large fraction of your population (I'd guess around 20-25%) having served in the armed forces at some time (vs say the US with 1%)
4. Making the [main gun on the main US tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheinmetall_Rh-120) (among a lot of other military kit that comes from the EU)
5. Being a FOB all during the Cold War, and tasked with killing your own population with nukes (and illegal gassing) to delay the enemy advance
6. Still being a FOB (and huge hospital), in spite of a morally and politically problematic drone war being supported from there
7. Taking in a refugee or two
8. Just having WON the Cold War - what the heck [went](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#Critics) [wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Clark#Book_on_modern_wars) that we have re-arm all of a sudden?

I don't want to diss my US friends (and compatriots) with this, and I still think more USA in the world is better than less - but just be careful what kind of effects careless talk can have on an alliance (to which the most plausible alternative is Eurasia).

For most places in Europe I think the critical bits are not these discussions (which aren't all that surprising given open statements you hear from Trump).

The relevant data points are that Trump got elected (in denial of professed republican values), and more recently Mattis leaving [the way he did](https://taskandpurpose.com/mattis-resignation-letter).

&gt;	In 1942, with so many eligible workers diverted to military service, the nation was facing a severe labor shortage. Economists feared that businesses would keep raising salaries to compete for workers, and that inflation would spiral out of control as the country came out of the Depression. To prevent this, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9250, establishing the Office of Economic Stabilization.
This froze wages. Businesses were not allowed to raise pay to attract workers.
Businesses were smart, though, and instead they began to use benefits to compete. Specifically, to offer more, and more generous, health care insurance.
Then, in 1943, the Internal Revenue Service decided that employer-based health insurance should be exempt from taxation. This made it cheaper to get health insurance through a job than by other means.

"&gt;Still not correct. Germany is forced to export an increasing amount of the renewables due to lack of production control.

Your link is from 2017 concerned with the numbers from 2016.

&gt; And electricity, oil and coal are very exchangeable.

Not so. Home heating systems in Germany, which make up a huge chunk of gross final energy consumption, are almost exclusively powered by gas. Sure, you could try to force all homeowners to switch to eletrctic heating, but changing all the infrastructure would take decades (and electric heating is more wasteful anyway). 
Similar with oil-powered industrial parks - which make up another huge chunk of overall energy consumption in export-oriented Germany: they can't simply decide to run their mills and turbines of off electricity instead of diesel engines.

&gt;People migrate.

I genuinely do not understand this point.

&gt;That why you can’t just cherry-pick electricity and declare a success.

No one did that. The article linked in the OP makes it clear that it's about electricity. You misread (or misinterpreted) but that's no one else's fault.

These are direct quoted from the article you assert ""gives an misleading impression that renewables are a massive success-story we can keep scaling"":

&gt;""If Germany continues at this rate, we are going to miss our 2030 targets,"" he said.

I don't see how the article is over-enthusiastic in any way if you read past the headline.

&gt;We need storage to increase the share of renewables and to eliminate the massive hidden cost of keeping base load power plants online to support renewables when they fail to deliver.

"**Religion**

**Islam is the predominant religion in Chechnya, practiced by 95% of those polled in Grozny in 2010.[88]** Chechens are overwhelmingly adherents to the Shafi'i Madhhab of Sunni Islam,[89] the republic having converted to Islam between the 16th and the 19th centuries. Due to historical importance, many Chechens are Sufis, of either the Qadiri or Naqshbandi orders. Most of the population follows either the Shafi'i or the Hanafi,[90] schools of jurisprudence, fiqh. The Shafi'i school of jurisprudence has a long tradition among the Chechens,[91] and thus it remains the most practiced.[92]

The once-strong Russian minority in Chechnya, mostly Terek Cossacks and estimated as numbering approximately 25,000 in 2012, are predominantly Russian Orthodox, although presently only one church exists in Grozny. In August 2011, Archbishop Zosima of Vladikavkaz and Makhachkala performed the first mass baptism ceremony in the history of the Chechen Republic in the Terek River of Naursky District in which 35 citizens of Naursky and Shelkovsky districts were converted to Orthodoxy.[93]

On 19 January 2015, 12 days after the Charlie Hebdo shooting, a march took place in Grozny against the publication of caricatures of the prophet Mohammed.[94] The Chechen Ministry of Interior reported that more than a million people participated, while according to the sources of Caucasian Knot the number was between 350,000 and 500,000.[95]

&gt;Additionally you are straw Manning I said Muslim countries. Nothing about the west where we are not this barbaric and if they did do it usually our laws would punish them. 

That’s not what strawmanning means. Not all Muslim countries practice FGM. Many non Muslim communities do practice FGM. Most Muslims in the west ARE of western culture, other than those who immigrated to the west as adults. My Muslim community, for example, is repulsed by FGM.  and my community has been in the US since the 50s.

You’re a terrible human for insisting this problem is a Muslim one. How can we fix a problem we don’t have in the US or Europe when people like you keep insisting there is a problem?

"In general, yes. But that doesn't answer my question at all. How does the world become a better place when the bigger economies impose their will on smaller ones? Small economies already get screwed due to policies from the big players. African countries get screwed out of millions, if not billions on the daily due to agricultural tariffs and subsidies in the EU and the US for example. That's not getting any better when big economies force smaller ones to unify their corporate taxes. There will be very little reason for big businesses to settle in smaller economies and small economies will never grow because there won't be any comparative advantages.

You have to keep in mind that countries design their foreign policies and international trade agreements with nothing but their own benefit in mind. If someone else also benefits that's cool, but it doesn't matter. A national government has one sole interest and that is looking out for the country it represents.

"This article is a bit misleading...

First , he didn't slash the wages for the poor... he increased the minimum wage but the increase was not as high as the previous government planned. The excuse given to not give the planned raise is that they need to reduce the budget deficit and the planned raise didn't fit in the current budget.

Regarding the income taxes.. In Brazil the income tax is calculated in brackets.

&amp;#x200B;

|monthly Income in R$|Tax|
|:-|:-|
|&lt; 1,903.98|exempt|
|\&gt;= 1,903.99 &lt;= 2,826.65|7.5%|
|\&gt;= 2,826.66 &lt;= 3,751.05|15%|
|\&gt;= 3,751.06 &lt;= 4,664.68|22.5%|
|\&gt; 4,664.68|27.5%|

&amp;#x200B;

They want to increase the income on all the brackets which makes everyone pay less taxes and they want to decrease the tax on the higher bracket from 27.5% to 25%, which further reduce the taxes on the richer. ... So that means a tax cut for everyone albeit the richer are getting a larger tax cut.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

But to counter balance this higher tax cut for the richer they also want to get rid of a bunch of tax rebates like... expenditure with education, health and other stuff.  I guess that would count as a tax increase that has a bigger impact on the middle class and the richer as the poor are generally exempt because they fall in the exempt bracket to begin with.",worldnews

"In Renaissance England, wealthy merchants were eager to find investment opportunities, so they established a number of companies to trade in various parts of the world. Each company was made up of individuals who purchased shares of company stock. The Crown granted a charter to each company with a monopoly to explore, settle, or trade with a particular region of the world. Profits were shared among the investors according to the amount of stock that each owned. More than 6,300 Englishmen invested in joint stock companies between 1585 and 1630, trading in Russia, Turkey, Africa, the East Indies, the Mediterranean, and North America.

Founding	Edit
Investors in the Virginia Company hoped to profit from the natural resources of the New World. In 1606 Captain Bartholomew Gosnoldobtained of King James I a charter for two companies. The first, for the South-Virginia or London Company, covered what are now Maryland, Virginia and Carolina, between Latitude 34° and Latitude 41° North. Gosnold's principal backers were Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Somers, Edward Wingfield and Richard Hakluyt. The second Company, the Plymouth Adventurers, were empowered to settle as far as 45° North, encompassing what are present day Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and New England.[4] The Company paid all the costs of establishing each colony, and in return controlled all land and resources there, requiring all settlers to work for the Company.

The business of the company was the settlement of the Virginia colony, supported by a labour force of voluntary transportees under the customary indenture system. In exchange for 7 years of labor for the company, the company provided passage, food, protection, and land ownership (if the worker survived).",worldnews

Did you read the paragraph before the ideas of how to get Mexico to pay for the wall? It specifically says that all of those ideas are specifically to force Mexico to pay in a large, one time, lump sum payment. For Trump to now say he never said that is a lie, and that's what we're talking about. 

Edit: also, just to respond to your random jab at Obama regarding executive orders, Trump is on pace to surpass the number of executive orders signed by Obama. It's not really a fair comparison considering you're comparing two 4 year terms to Trump's not even one, but so far if Trump continues at this pace he'll have signed more executive orders. 

And also, holding the government hostage as your method of ""going through Congress"" is pretty shit, and threatening to declare a national emergency would be specifically to bypass our legislative branch.

It's not about intelligence, education, or any other thing but the fact that ""Party First"" politics has started causing smart people to vote against their own interests.

We live in Kentucky. Very near to Harlan. Harlan has had at least 2 very, very volatile fights to unionize their coal workers. (Watch Harlan County, U.S.A. for a look at what they went through in the '70s.) Yet, for some reason, (Jesus) they favor Republicans. 

It has been made clear by the Republicans that they want Jesus to be their guiding light. That they pray before every decision they make and that they will always follow the Bible in their policies.

Ignoring the fact that that is a lie, they have anyone who even somewhat cares about Christianity as a lock. No matter what they say or do, they will be lauded and supported. Even if those policies go against Christian values.

Take the ""Grab them by the pussy!"" line. That's obviously an adulterous act when said by a married man. ""It's just locker room talk."" were the words my own mother said when I brought it up to her.

No, to call it a group of ""uneducated"" people isn't the real truth. There is so much more going on behind his support that will leave us heartbroken next election if it's not understood. If he's not impeached there is absolutely a chance he could get reelected.

The people who go to Church vote. Those who don't aren't as apt to. There is skin in the game this time for those of us who understand who Trump is, we know what he's willing to do to this country and where his loyalties are.

Think of those who support him as you would a Scientologist. You get suckered into the group by some friend or advertisement. You go to the meetings and find out they might be able to help you with your life. You find friends and comradery with others that are there. Then they start asking for money but it's only a little, so you accept. Then you get asked for more, well, you've already given them a little, what's a little more. 

Then up the chain, you go. Every time giving as much as you feel comfortable with. Then you see someone you know from before you joined. They ask how you could be a part of something like that. You defend it tooth and nail, because if you don't, then you're a fool who was taken for one. You couldn't have been scammed. 

So, you tell the friend to fuck off. Alienating all the people in your life that would tell you how dumb you're being. Justifying everything you feel unsure of because, at this point, you've given up so much of your life, money, and relationships that you can't admit that you've done something incorrectly.

Eventually, if you're lucky, you realize the mistake, cut your losses, and get out. That's hard though. Because doing so will result in you having to tell everyone you knew before that you were wrong. You will have to start your whole life over. Who wants to do that?

Trump supporters started during the election. He said a lot of things with enough conviction and confidence that people bought it. He has charisma and says his mind. That's endearing to some people, a lot of people actually. 

The problem is that he talks out of his ass and lies through his teeth. If you ignore that though, you start justifying his words and accepting things like ""All politicians lie. What's wrong with him doing it?"" and the like.

Going further and further down a rabbit hole of delusional thinking until you are unwilling to admit that you have been wrong the whole time. 

It sounds ridiculous but it's the only thing that makes sense to me. Otherwise, the entire group of voters who chose him and are defending him still is just complete idiots without sense or logic. That doesn't fit with what I've seen.

&gt; The foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan have met and agreed on the need to prepare their populations for peace and to discuss possibilities to cooperate economically.

&gt; Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan Elmar Mammadyarov and his Armenian counterpart, Zohrab Mnatsakanyan, met January 16 in Paris, along with representatives from the OSCE Minsk Group, the international body tasked with facilitating negotiations between the two sides.

&gt; The two ministers, for example, &amp;quot;Agreed upon the necessity of taking concrete measures to prepare the populations for peace.&amp;quot; If this were in fact done seriously it would be a remarkable development, as public opinion on both sides of the conflict has badly hardened in recent years.

Yeah, that's literally the whole point. I'm Israeli, I assure you I know better than you that we drop bombs on Palestine and vice versa. I've just never heard of Palestine being bombed *because of stone throwing*, which is what fuhrertrump claimed, and TerribleBedroom asked evidence for.

&gt; but if you want evidence of them JUSTIFYING their actions (being bombing villages) by equating kids throwing stones with serious acts of terrorism

Put $5 billion in funding for a wall in the budget, BUT, this is paid out over 20 years ($250 million/year) and comes out of the military budget. The project is evaluated yearly (in January, far away from elections) by a congressional committee which has the authority to cancel the project for any reason, without congressional or the president's approval. In this case, the wall project costs $250 million, lasts only one year, and we shut up this fucking asshole of a president (although he'll parade this around as some kind of victory we will never hear the end of).

Either you legalise **ALL** drugs for recreational use or you make them **ALL** illegal, simple as.

&gt;There are plenty of reasons why intelligence professionals are alarmed by Huawei’s involvement in our 5G networks, particularly, the close relationship between Huawei and a Chinese government with a history of cyberespionage. Add the fact that China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law gives Beijing the power to compel Huawei’s support for its intelligence work, and it should be a clear-cut case.

"There does not necessarily need to be a single government. In Europe, for example, each country sets its own VAT rates, but within the EU there are certain rules on how high these VAT rates should be and are allowed to be. This means that countries are still able to adjust their rates if they need more or less money, want to provide certain economic stimulus or even a small degree of competition, but it does not allow, Luxembourg for example, to set its VAT rates at 0% and then have Belgians, Frenchmen and Germans do their shopping there. International treaties (or EU wide legislation) that agree on certain limits could help.

Another way to reduce this is to make laws that outlaw these loopholes without doing anything about the rates. For example, a royalties payment from Starbucks Germany to Starbucks Netherlands would no longer be seen as a royalties payment, but for what it is, a tax evasion. Writing laws that deal with these kind of situations is extremely difficult and would probably also require international cooperation.

I think a combination of both is needed. I'm not naïeve and I don't think that we can solve this for the whole world, but I think this is something the EU should cooperate on. European countries should work more towards the common good rather than a small benefit for their own countries.

"The ""fairness"" notion comes into effect after paying for all necessary goods. Things you can't avoid, that you have no choice but to pay.

Stuff like rent, transport, food, health care, taxes, education, etc... 

A rich person can be taxed far higher than a poor person, and still luxuriate in opulence and wealth. A poor person pays for those things, and then has 0 left.

That's where the notion of fairness enters. It's why flat taxes or regressive taxes are inherently unfair. If you take 20% of everyone's salary as taxes, taking 20% of someone who's earning 2000$/month is way more impactful than taking 20% of someone who's earning 200000$/month.

The former is a catastrophic level of taxation, whereas the latter is basically totally ignorable.

"From the link, first paragraph:

&gt;In the days after President Trump [fired James B. Comey](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/us/politics/james-comey-fired-fbi.html?module=inline) as F.B.I. director, law enforcement officials became so concerned by the president’s behavior that they began investigating whether he had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests...

Are we support to forget now [this December 2017 report from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/us/politics/how-fbi-russia-investigation-began-george-papadopoulos.html)?

&gt;During a night of heavy drinking at an upscale London bar in May 2016, George Papadopoulos, a young foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, made a startling revelation to Australia’s top diplomat in Britain: Russia had political dirt on Hillary Clinton.  
&gt;  
&gt;About three weeks earlier, Mr. Papadopoulos had been told that Moscow had thousands of emails that would embarrass Mrs. Clinton, apparently stolen in an effort to try to damage her campaign.  
&gt;  
&gt;Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear. But two months later, [when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/us/politics/assange-timed-wikileaks-release-of-democratic-emails-to-harm-hillary-clinton.html?module=inline), Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians’ role.  
&gt;  
&gt;The hacking and the revelation that a member of the Trump campaign may have had inside information about it were driving factors that led the F.B.I. to open an investigation in July 2016 into Russia’s attempts to disrupt the election **and whether any of President Trump’s associates conspired.**

No more Mr. Papadopoulos angle...? Also, typical of the New York Times reporting is the ""sources"":

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;...according to **former** law enforcement officials and **others familiar with the investigation.**

&amp;#x200B;

Which always are unnamed.  Let's continue:

&gt;""It is unclear whether Mr. Mueller is still pursuing the counterintelligence matter, and some **former law enforcement officials outside the investigation**...""

&amp;#x200B;

Just a reminder that nobody in the Mueller probe is speaking about this.... or leaking.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, and this is always buried in all New York Times ""reporting"" about this matter:

&gt;**No evidence has emerged publicly that Mr. Trump was secretly in contact with or took direction from Russian government officials**. An F.B.I. spokeswoman and a spokesman for the special counsel’s office both declined to comment.

He had 2 years to get this passed, why now, why right when the democrats take the house is he so suddenly up in arms about getting it done. Its a talking point to blame the evil democrats. He created a shut down in order to point the finger.

What most people forget with any project like this, is that you also have to budget about 10% each year to maintain it. So if this costs $5 billion to build (he estimated all sorts of crazy numbers. If he is asking for $5 billion, i would suspect cost woud ballon to $10-20 billion) you would need $500 million each year to just keep it standing. So its not just $5 billion and walk away... it will be a constant cost to the American people for a Donald Trump vanity project.",worldnews

There is no guarantee that disparity will just work itself out. And even if it will, it could take generations and generations. How is it right to tell people now that they just need to stick it out, and maybe one day their great grandchildren will live in an equal and fair society?

Yes, bottom-up approaches are needed, as well, but there is no benefit in simply waiting and hoping for bias to work itself out of the system.

Note: 'affirmative action' does not mean lowering standards. Applicants have to pass the same hurdle of skills.

"The store is on the verge of going under, anyway. It's untenable. They charge 2-3x the rates for most goods compared to two towns over, and they're doing it in desperation because nobody buys anything. If anybody reports it they will close their doors and we will be without a store. It seems inevitable that they do that, anyway, unless they have some kind of awakening about their business strategy.

The community isn't shy about talking about it, so everybody avoids their meat. I'm less worried about people succumbing to that than I am for the people, particularly elderly folk in this community who don't drive and can't easily go two towns over for bread and milk. It is a risk, though, and I don't like it. I don't like supporting a business that behaves like this in any capacity. And I hate the waste.

I understand your frustration, but be careful about blaming me for this. The store owners are the bad actors here. The community, myself included, tries to cope with it.

US VACCINE COURT PAYS $6 MILLION TO GARDASIL VICTIMS, MOST CLAIMS NOT YET SETTLED

By : admin | Comments : 85 Comments |Category : health

“This new information from the government shows that the serious safety concerns about the use of Gardasil have been well-founded,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.  “Public health officials should stop pushing Gardasil on children.”

￼Documents Obtained by Judicial Watch Reveal 200 Claims Filed with HHS for HPV Vaccine Injuries and Deaths, 49 Compensated 

Documents Reveal that the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) has Paid Out Nearly $6 million in Claims to Victims of Controversial HPV (human papillomavirus) Vaccine, including Families of Two Dead

(Washington, DC) – Judicial Watch announced today that it has received documents from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) revealing that its National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) has awarded $5,877,710 dollars to 49 victims in claims made against the highly controversial HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccines. To date 200 claims have been filed with VICP, with barely half adjudicated.

"&gt; Except no amount of integration will make you treat us equally

Then why are several migrant groups treated equally and without prejudice? There is a bad image from muslims, partially warranted sadly by the actions of several individuals and historical problems in many countries. 

So yes, there is extra vigilance by the part of natives towards those groups, does this sound weird? Everyone does this, its hardly a ""white people"" problem alone, but human nature to be distrustful of others especially if they have bad reputation, and lets face it, muslims have the worst in the modern world. 

&gt;Hell... White people robbed my house last month. No community response.

People robbing your place is doubtfully racially motivated, white people rob white people, black people rob white and black people, this is not something a community will be outraged by, it's sadly 'normal' crime, which is shitty tbh. 

&gt;Where was all this calls for integration when white people firebombed my grandmother's take away.

This is unacceptable and you will find the majority of people do not condone this, at all. We all have savages and ""trash"". 

&gt;If I dance through every damn hoop will racism end

The difference is that those white people are the natives, and you are the foreigner (as am I btw, I have lived in 4 countries so far)

When you are a guest in someones house, it is you who has to bend and dance over hoops, not the host, as I have. 

&gt;I will still get stopped and searched more than you.

Possible, sadly this is a consequence of profiling, which is a consequence of limited police resources. If you have X population that is overrepresented in crime, that population will be stopped more often, its shitty but its a logical way to deal with limited resources. 

This is a governmental/organisational problem, not racism per se (or at least i would like to think, if it is due to racism then there is a problem yes).

"&gt;You keep trying to shuffle the Nazi’s warmongering under the rug implying that you don’t actually think it matters.

I don't say it's irrelevant in the case of WWII, I say using war to further an ideology isn't unique to Nazis. I may be biased in the sense that I don't like hardcore collectivist ideologies as a whole, so I'm willing to lump all of them in the same category even if Nazis were proven to be inherently more likely to instigate conflict.

&gt;I can tell that you don’t care if a fascist government conscripts its elderly and children into an offensive war.

Depends on what the war is for. It's also hard to say what I'd think in a life and death situation. Conscription is obviously fine, but sending conscripts to die in war is something I can't see myself agreeing with. But then again, I don't know what I'd really do in a situation where I'm convinced something needs to be destroyed no matter what.

&gt;Maybe you’d care if it was your dad or your son dying in Rhineland. Then again, maybe not. 

The human mind is so malleable and easy to influence that I could very well accept it, if I was convinced the cause was worth dying for. Then again that wouldn't be *me* in that situation, because I'd know it's a futile effort.

"I think you're misunderstanding my first point...I was essentially saying that the income inequality is virtually unchanged in the US over a 25 year span, yet its now being brought up as a major issue.

Can you please expand on ""greater degree of involvement across the entire medical sector""? An entire industry exists in healthcare in the US because of the government, and thats medical billing and coding. Direct Primary Care practices have cut their costs by as much as 50% by no longer dealing with insurance/medicare. 

Based on some limited reading I've done on the Singapore model, it seems like they've streamlined that piece by subsidizing the care itself while allowing the hospitals to act as a private entity, essentially allowing people to use their ""Medisave"" as a sort of healthcare voucher to promote competition. I would be much more favorable of that system if two things happened...the Medicare tax we already pay is replaced by ""Medisave"" rather than piggybacking more taxes. And that doctors and/or patients have the ability to opt out (I don't like government force). I don't think the US could pull off the Singapore model due to special interests which makes me skeptical of the ""approved medicine"" list, but I will admit it would be better. I think the Vox article I read gets this part incorrect though:

""But that happens within a context where the government is aggressively managing the supply of health services, the price of treatments, and the broader behavioral environment in which the system operates.""

I think by giving people a ""Medisave"" account that allows them to use those funds for services, medical services due to competition for those dollars would keep costs low (assuming the back end and overhead processes are streamlined). Similar to an old company I worked for that offered $5,000 a year reimbursed tuition, many schools in the area surprisingly enough offered programs for $5,000!

"&gt;The caste system could be undone overnight (from a legal standpoint).

This comment is probably the epitome of Western ignorance about the caste system. 

Let me try to explain. The caste system in India is much like racism in the United States. Slavery laws/ discriminatory laws in the USA have been abolished ages back, so has the caste system in India. But though the caste system in India and racism in the USA are formally/legally 'fixed' some of the symptoms still linger. 

All my life, I have lived in the cities of Mumbai and Delhi, and have witnessed no caste discrimination at all. I do not even know what my own caste is. Nobody knows each other's castes either and nobody cares. But at the same time, I am aware that there are underdeveloped, rural areas in India where the caste system may be rampant; the way racism against blacks is more rampant in the southern states of America than the rest. 

&gt;Is India doing anything to improve or move away from the caste system?

The caste system has been given adequate attention in the very Constitution the country was built upon, and even in modern legislation/ policies. I won't write about all of it, a simple google search will get you the facts. One example: affirmative action. There is a fixed quota for lower castes in each educational institutions and often also in government jobs.  ",worldnews
"You could build a functioning rail gun for your car pretty easily.   The actual basics of a railgun (or similar, a coilgun) are pretty simple and any intro to Electricity and Magnetism Physcis class covers it.

"While it's true that batteries store energy at 95% efficiency, the method by which the energy is produced to be then stored into batteries is the problem. And there is not nearly enough energy generation to switch to fully battery-electric transportation and recharge from the grid, to the point where we'd need to generate 7-10x more grid power than we currently do.

Hydrogen on the other hand is not an energy storage medium, it's an energy vector. Hydrogen does not store energy, it has an inherent energy value, that can be used. How you produce the hydrogen is the issue, sure, but you can produce it via electrolysis, from fossil fuels, it's a side-product of any number of chemical reactions in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries and is at the moment simply vented into the atmosphere. Hydrogen costs are estimated to drop from $11/kg to under $7/kg, with the average FCV tank capacity at 5-6 kkgs of hydrogen. So, eventually (by 2030-ish) you'd get a full tank for 35-42USD. While venting nothing but water vapor.  
Then there's also the question of recycling of used materials. Lithium recycling is still fairly expensive and inefficient. Platinum (the most critical element used in fuel cells atm) currently already has a global recycling rate of 99,9%.  
There's further benefits to switching to hydrogen, as you can use it to fuel anything else that runs on electricity, you can store it, produce it locally, if you have excess renewable ower, and is quite beneficial to the renewables sector as well, as overproduction and lack of storage for that excess energy is a major issue, as well as transmission losses between remote renewables generation and urban consumers.

"Deeply rooted antisemitism in Poland prior to the war participated in making it easy for the Nazis to find and kill Jews, who were already segregated and isolated. It is also not entirely surprising that after the war, many Jews decided to get out of Poland for good - they did not feel welcome, their properties having been confiscated by Poles and the local population having relatively little sympathy for them. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kielce_pogrom

&gt;Germans didnt ask Poles their opinions about Jews.

They sure did - those who liked the poles could be executed, and those who disliked them were very welcome to give information about them. As in other places they occupied in Europe, the nazis relied on existing anti-semitism to identify jews and carry out the genocide.

My point here is not to smear Poland as being responsible for the holocaust - of course it was a Nazi idea, and it was put in place by the Nazis. However, it is concerning that nowadays Poland seeks to blame contemporary Germany for Nazi crimes, while at the same time displaying intolerant behavior. What the nazis did was not an expression of an inherently evil German nature. It was an expression of Human nature. 

To be completely fair, I have some personal bias in the matter - an older family member emigrated from Poland during WWII, and was simultaneously very proud of fighting against the Nazis, and one of the most racist people I know. He was of course not representative of all Poles. However, such cases are a good reminder that things are not all black and white, victim and culprit, and that the categories ""German"" and ""Pole"" are not shorthand for ""Evil"" and ""Good"", and not even for ""Nazi"" and ""not Nazi"".

This clearly illustrates that the Central Banking system is preying on the vulnerable by taking additional money from them that they obviously do not have...and to the tune of $34 BILLION dollars in a single year.  The messed up part is that this is completely ""legal"" according to Governments and Banking policies, but it is extremely far from ""moral"".  You should ask yourself if the legal standard should define the moral standard, as is what's happening today across the globe - I would argue that the moral standard should define the legal standard, especially within the financial system.

A run on the banks would only serve to, by action, overturn the belief of the Central Banking system that they control Governments and by way of which, the People as well.  To kill any parasite, you must suffocate it out of existence.  I'm not advocating to kill the banking system, but I will readily advocate that the banking system has become parasitic in nature and needs to be reformed in a manner where morality defines legality.  Where this has traditionally been done in backroom deals and the greasing of palms between banking executives and state/national government officials, never mind the ~~bribery~~ lobbyists, the curtains must be lifted and the People's best interests be put as the priority.  After all, we're all in this together - the banks hold OUR money, not THEIR money.  Without the People depositing money into the banks and taking loans, there would be no banks - their very existence is to provide a public service, not screw people over.  That, my friend, is the line that has been crossed and drives the need for reform.

If making a run on the banks accomplishes meaningful reform and improves the quality of life &amp; financial security of billions of people across the globe, then there is absolutely no question about it - a run must be made.

"In the middle ages, many people were not allowed to read or write under punishment of the law. It would be difficult for them to have learned to read even if they wanted to, not because of intelligence, but because likely no one they knew could read either. It was not seen as an essential survival skill by most people then either. As time went on and more people were able and allowed, and as society viewed it as an essential skill, and as populations decided to educate as many people as possible rather than just the upper class, the skills were passed on to more people.

"But you are repeating Nazi propaganda. The Treaty of Versailles did not cause WWII. Germany never paid any substantial sum in reparations as they were ordered too. In fact, it was the allies tepidity towards enforcing the rules of the treaty that actually led to Germany's massive and blatant rearmament.

&gt; The actual amount of reparations that Germany was obliged to pay out was not the 132 billion marks decided in the London Schedule of 1921 but rather the 50 billion marks stipulated in the A and B Bonds. Historian Sally Marks says the 112 billion marks in ""C bonds"" were entirely chimerical—a device to fool the public into thinking Germany would pay much more. The actual total payout from 1920 to 1931 (when payments were suspended indefinitely) was 20 billion [German gold marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_gold_mark), worth about US$5 billion or £1 billion British pounds. 12.5 billion was cash that came mostly from loans from New York bankers. The rest was goods such as coal and chemicals, or from assets like railway equipment. The reparations bill was fixed in 1921 on the basis of a German capacity to pay, not on the basis of Allied claims. The highly publicised rhetoric of 1919 about paying for all the damages and all the veterans' benefits was irrelevant for the total, but it did determine how the recipients spent their share. Germany owed reparations chiefly to France, Britain, Italy and Belgium; the US Treasury received $100 million.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic#cite_note-28) 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar\_Republic#Reparations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic#Reparations)

The economic problems of pre WWII Germany were caused by hyperinflation owing to the Weimar Republic's foolish idea to print more money to solve their debt crisis and the crash of the American economy in 1929 which resulted in foreign banks withdrawing their money from German banks out of fear.

No study is truly neutral, as you will always have funding from somewhere that can bias the preposition of the study.

But even the most pro circumcision studies I have seen, have no properly documented benefits. There is speculation that it might in some cases help against infection and HIV, but my stance is, why accept the extreme of cutting of a part of the body when other standard non intrusive medical treatments is just as if not more effective. 

And if those causes is enough, it is just as justifiable to do FGM as the same benefits will be there, though we have banned that all across the western world (except for the current debacle in the US...) because it is affecting women.

The world order is currently changing. The old rules are out and nations are playing for domination. 

The EU is currently weakened with internal conflict (yellow vests) and Brexit.

There is a decoupling of the EU/US alliance, as seen by the attempts to drop NATO. The US has also pulled out of Syria recently looking to finance the wall. 

So while the US turns inwards, and the EU is weakened, Russia sees the chance to expand its borders. These lands have ancient conflicts so there will always be a reason for it. But the old order of respecting sovereignty are out which were initially broken by the US in the forced regime changes in Afghanistan and Iraq in the post cold war era.

Putin tested the waters with the Crimea and no-one touched him. He accidentally shot down a civilian airliner with the same result. He's not concerned if some people starve as he's pretty much an autocratic leader and not a communist.

We can produce beef sustainably, a field of cattle should be a carbon sink due the grass, grass is a major carbon sink, however many cattle nowdays are raised on dirt not grass. To make it worse we cut down trees for space, and put houses on the grassland, a double whammy.

Veganism is poorly tested, and there are studies showing it to weaken mental health, bones, lower happiness, etc. Encouraging people to switch to a poorly tested diet is daft, the last time we did that was in the 1960's when we told everyone to cut out fat and eat grains.

If meat was the only issue then sure, sacrificing our health a bit to keep the planet going would be necessary, but it's not. There are plenty of other options. If people want to voluntarily reduce their intake that is great, but trying to force people to eat less of a healthy food is asking for trouble, especially when the alternatives are poorly thought through.

Imo, we need to put aside a % of our annual budget for carbon sequestration, water desalinisation, re-wilding, even construction of more highrise and lowrise flats. There is evidence that reintroducing cattle to some areas will get the grass to return, I'd like to see more on that.

"&gt;Sorry for the cherry picking, but does this mean that you accept that a portion of it is non-concentual? And thanks for the in depth reply btw :)

No, the portion of it not generated by consensual transaction is generated instead by that individuals own labor. You can generate all of your wealth through consensual transaction but there’s usually some work involved.

&gt;A different person consents to part of the product of their labor being forfeited in return for some agreed upon arrangement between the two individuals.

What is your point? Can you give examples of this?

&gt;But in the case of nearly every ""transaction"" of that sort that takes place in capitalist society, only one of these individuals holds all of the cards; the landlord/ factory owner/ shareholder. They own the means that the other requires to do their job- and leverage that in order to get a better deal for themselves.

If it’s the case that in these transactions one individual possesses all of the leverage, then why would the seemingly advantaged individual engage with the disadvantaged at all? This is because your posit is false. The seemingly disadvantaged individual does have leverage, and they may (and do) use it to improve their standing. Both gain something from the transaction, both have bargaining power, and while one may have more incentive to engage in the transaction than the other, this is the fault of neither, and does not lessen the righteousness of the interaction.

&gt;If I owned say: 100 'things"", and each of the ""things"" was worth $10. But the highest price I could get for them was $5, was I making a profit? Because the labour of an employee is obviously worth far more than what they are payed, hence how coorporations make any money.

This is circular reasoning. The employee should bargain for the best pay that they can, this is true, however if they were paid to the maximum of the value of their labor then the business that hired them would go under and they would lose their job anyway. Without profit there is no incentive for the employer, and without incentive for the employer there is no job for the employee. Assuming you’re attacking this aspect of capitalism and not simply advocating for redistribution of wealth, there’s nothing inherently wrong with making a profit especially because it’s profit generated by consensual agreement. By eliminating pay inequality you would eliminate all incentive for all parties involved to improve the product or lower prices, effectively creating a monopoly in and of itself since there would be no competition as all businesses would be identical. This is logically concluded by the eradication of business and currency, and cascades into a web of immoral coercion.

&gt;Said interaction will only benefit them in comparison to no interaction at all or an even worse trade. If not for the Monopoly on power that one party holds over the other (in the form of their ownership of the means of production), there would be no reason for one party to give up their labour so that the other might profit.

I covered the monopoly on power by the landholder in my response to your first point.

&gt;But said wealth prodominantly from the labour of the worker and not the other way around. The average person has no choice but to sell their labour at market value in a market where it is highly undervalued because of the power held by the 1%.

Let’s do away with this notion of the 1%, because there’s also a 2% and a 3% and so on, it’s arbitrary. Yes, the value of ones labor could potentially be above market value. However stealing from one individual who gained their wealth through consensual transaction to redistribute it to someone else by force is immoral. There is nothing moral about theft. Humans are individuals, not a collective. One individual engaging with another in a consensual transaction is not immoral and it isn’t the concern of others. In a communist society the people would intervene in this and prevent profit from being made, prevent a consensual transaction of personal property from being made. That is immoral. Everything about communism is immoral.

"The thing is, race as some kind of class *is* a social construct. There isn’t some dividing line between black and white, Asian and not, etc., even though the extremes are fairly noticeable.

Your anthropology professor was actually fairly correct, because while we can use genes to trace lineages and guess which people are more related to certain other people, race is almost entirely based on appearances and cultural cues that may or may not correlate to genetics.

A great instance of this is so-called African-Americans, who are coded as “black” racially. But a study* found that the average African-American has about 20-25% European ancestry. So does that change their racial identity? I don’t think you’d find many people arguing that, since Americans tend to follow a sort of modified “one-drop” rule.

that's the same poll, reported by a different website.  it was a global poll of Muslims across several different countries, many of which had high illiteracy rates.  In order for those polls to be useful, you need to poll each country individually.  and what you'll find that the issues are regional, not world wide.

Because they disagree on what is or isn't the word of God, and they also disagree on if the word should be imposed as law or not.  I encourage you research the history of Hadith, which is what most Islamic law is based on. 

The Quran are the words Muhammad recited to the entire Muslim community at Friday prayers, and was compiled 10 years after he died.  Secular and Muslim historians alike agree that the words in the Quran can't really be doubted as something Muhammad did say, because they reached wide audiences, were repeated over the 22 years.  Muslims memorized and wrote them down, and when compiled, the only safe thing to say about the Quran is that it may be missing verses of the prophet, but we can safely assume the words in the Quran were Muhammad's words.

Hadith, on the otherhand, were much more casual.  Some of them had Muhammad simply say things to a small group of people, for example he was with his companions at a market, and told a man not to hide the rotten dates he was selling under the fresh dates, as it was deceitful.  Only a handful of people hear sayings like this (usually), and these sayings were passed down orally for 200 years before being compiled.

estimates are that 20-30% of hadith were considered illegitimate right away because they contradicted the Quran.  Most illegitimate hadith arose during the Ummayad dynasty (Islam's second dynasty, which arose about 30 years after the prophet died), which attempted to rewrite Islam significantly, and met with revolt because of it.  the Ummayad's were centered in Damascus, and many of the faulty hadith are akin to the early Roman laws which used to rule Syria.  For example, making it mandatory for a woman to cover her hair in public was a Roman practice, not an Arab one.  Yet some hadith insist the hair should be covered, while most hadith follow the pattern of Muhammad telling MEN to look away from women who were not dressed modestly, not the other way around.  

starting in the 1800s is when Hadith began to be viewed as infallible by a majority of Muslims in the Middle East.  With the rise of Saudi Arabia controlling Mecca and their oil wealth, they've managed to export this philosophy that not only is Hadith 100% reliable as scripture, but that Islam should be law imposed on everyone, including non Muslims (at different points and places in Islam's history, the worst case was only Muslims were subjected to Islam as law before the 1800s.  There were attempts to impose Islam as law on non Muslims, but they were usually stopped by other Muslims, like the Ahmodins in Africa trying to force all non-muslims to convert or be deported, until they were stopped by the Fatimads in Egypt).  

Egypt, being a huge population, was one of the countries influenced by Suadi Arabia in this way.  Iraq was as well, and other places in central and SE Asia.  but it's very complex, and the core of the issue is mixing religion and government at all.  ",worldnews

"They're an explicitly socialist government, implementing explicitly pro worker laws, which was originally elected on the back of its socialist credentials. It's a country transitioning to socialism.

Regardless, socialism is when there is worker control over the means of production, as opposed to capital control over the means of production. Venezuela is 'socialist', because while it hasn't outright expropriated the entirety of the means of production, it has effectively neutered capital by introducing price controls, capital controls, threats of expropriations, and poor and arbitrary rule of law to make it so that capital no longer controls the means of production, whilst still technically owning it on paper. If you can't set the price for the goods you create, if you can't move your capital, and if you can't shut down your means of production due to threats that the government will expropriate it if you do (which is well documented in the Venezuelan case), there is no longer capital control over the means of production.

So yeah, maybe most of the means of production are, on paper, still owned by capital. But with the restrictions on them, they're no longer controlled by capital. They're held in trust by the vanguard party on behalf of the proletariat. It's not a society that has achieved full socialism, but it's definitely a socialist society.",worldnews
"&gt;How do you explain the vast majority of all college students being white, then?

Because the majority of the people are white? Is this really a question? Meanwhile a higher percentage of black applicants are accepted compared to white applicants just because of their skin colour.

&gt;Nope. We started at an imbalance and we are in the process of re-balancing.

You are in the process of tipping the scale to the other side. Re-balancing would be no discrimination.

What is ""the issue""? College requirements are IDENTICAL for everyone, but the acceptance rates are not. The acceptance is favoured for blacks and hispanics.

&gt;And a great many of those people have an advantage in building their lives due to generational wealth while others do not.

This has nothing to do with skin colour. So why are blacks and hispanics favoured for college application?

&gt;No they aren't. There is a wealth of studies and data that demonstrates this.

The wealth of studies and data actually demonstrate it is socio-economic factors instead of race or ethnicity.

&gt;Why are you comparing a poor white to a rich black? Is it because even you can't deny that poor whites are advantaged compared to poor blacks, and likewise for rich whites?

No, because the latter would be favoured for a college application despite having lived a more privileged life. This is how retarded this racism is.

&gt;Why are you such a pathetic, groveling liar? Are you scared that if you lose your privileges, you'll wind up exposed as a worthless incompetent unworthy of success compared to your currently disadvantaged countrymen?

Imagine the US military and their allies magically vanished, and you gave Saddam's Iraqi army a naval transport fleet to even get to the US.  Can you imagine them successfully occupying the US?

"Yeah, essentially. The US constantly sought to undermine the establishment of democracy in Vietnam and provided material support to France in its attempt to re-establish colonial Indochina. The US supported Diem's cancellation of free elections because he and the US knew that Diem would have lost horribly to Ho Chi Minh.

The Korean War was a proxy conflict between the USSR and the US, if you want to cut to the heart of it. Korea was particularly horrific, where the US dropped more ordinance than it did in the entire Pacific Theater of WWII, with wanton disregard for civilian casualties.

Journalist Zachary Keck [summarizes matters](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/how-american-air-power-destroyed-north-korea-21881) fairly concisely: 

&gt;North Korea’s lack of industrialization limited the number of enticing targets for strategic bombing. Consequently, as Armstrong again points out, “By the fall of 1952, there were no effective targets left for US planes to hit. Every significant town, city and industrial area in North Korea had already been bombed.”

&gt;Thereafter, American and allied aircraft turned their sights to North Korea’s hydroelectric plant and the the twenty dams in North Korea that controlled 75 percent of the country’s water, which was needed for agricultural and the production of rice. In May 1953, U.S. forces knocked five of these dams out , causing massive flooding. It also put millions in North Korea at risk for starvation, although the worst of that was prevented because of a massive influx of food aid from the Soviet Union and China. The bombings did cause widespread electrical outages, and by the U.S. Air Force’s estimates destroyed all but 4 to 5 percent of North Korea’s railways.

Most scholars consider these blatant war crimes.",worldnews

"Apparently the sewers in London are made out of brick and mortar, which contributes to the formation of fatbergs by providing an alkaline environment where the grease can undergo saponification and solidify. The rough edges of the bricks can also provide points for the fatberg to start forming by snagging solids (tissues etc) that accumulate over time.

&gt; Fatbergs are also helped to form by the historical infrastructure of London: there’s a chemical reaction called ‘saponification’ where the fat reacts with the lining of the sewers, turning the oil into a soap-like substance. It’s exactly the same process that our grandmothers would have used to create soap: heating up animal fat, then mixing it with ash. In this case, the oil is mostly old cooking oil. That heated oil produces free radicals which then bond with grit from London’s streets. The result can be quite liquid, or, like the Whitechapel fatberg, set like concrete. 

https://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/discover/exhibiting-fatberg-monster-whitechapel

&gt;  “When the fats, oils and grease are in the sewer’s alkaline environment, they combine with all the material that gets down there, such as wet wipes and nappies, and form a mass that becomes calcified [by interaction with calcium in the sewer water] and solid. It becomes like concrete and can’t easily be broken up. The teams working in the sewers have to break them up using hand tools because the high-pressure jet hoses can’t break it down sufficiently.”

"You held it together without being racist for a while, but if you truly believe for instance that all black people are better runners, they might have kept it simple with you because theres so much they would have to unteach you before they could start. Fortunately I have plenty of time to uneducate you. 

For one, the traits you're speaking about are not distinct enough. Skin color is operated on by ~368 genetic markers. Meaning that between a black person and white person, there are 368 sequences that are different that account for the difference. That's the same amount of genes, and the same ones if i'm not mistakes, that determine the difference between a pink and a grey mouse. Are pink and grey mice suddenly different species?

The main determining factor for a difference in species is the inability to mate, and if offspring does survive until birth, they're almost always infertile. I think there's plenty of evidence in the world that unions between humans of different races have viable offspring that are able to reproduce. 

In fact, if we wanted to base race solely on genetics, and genetic differences, then it makes even less sense for you to lump all black people together as athletic because of the sheer magnitude of genetic diversity in Africa. Statistically, if we popped into a random community in sub-Saharan Africa right now, and did genetic tests on 100 people, there would be a better chance that their DNA was close to yours or mine than to anyone elses in their own community. Africans are by far the most genetically diverse group of humans. If race was based on genes you could argue that there are several races in Africa, and one race of the descendants of the people who left Africa. 

Technically, we aren't even different species than Neanderthals or Demisovans. We're a different subspecies, but clearly the offspring between unions were viable and fertile, because today 1.5 to 3 percent of European DNA comes from Neanderthals and 1 to 2 percent of East Asian DNA comes from Denisovans, and that's still not enough to make us difference species.

"Gamergate will eternally infuriate me for that reason. Started off relatively innocuous: someone allegedly slept their way into getting noticed by games journalists, sparks backlash to get more accountability in a veritable wild west and unregulated side of journalism. This then causes a counter-backlash of media painting all gamers as redpill/incel/alt-right types in the same way BLM gets painted as thugs. A perfect storm for alt-right attitudes: believing one's self to be the victim, the media being the bad guy, and fighting ""the (liberal) man.""

So of course that's when the alt-right folk came sliiiding on in. Imo, most actually kept their politics out of Gamergate, but the fact of the matter is that obviously if you like their personality on these matters, you'll dig deeper.

And then you're caught. Then you *become* alt-right as you're exposed to the ""anti-SJW rabbit hole"". And what happens? Eventually discussion turns to dissent, and Gamergate wound up becoming the alt-right's biggest gaping way into gaming culture, somehow getting it chucked into the same lists as the_donald or Breitbart or Alex Jones.

"False conspiracy theories work because a lot of the time the argument seems convincing in the moment, and you have both a stake and conviction about why or how other people feel about this, so you defend your own conviction rather than question it. Not all sources are good either, even if they have a degree etc. But when you have a stake in the conviction you will just believe any source that seems credible enough to support your case no questions asked.

&gt; I'm a theorist if I tell you 9/11 was for sure an inside job, but I didn't say that. I said the word ""likely"", because the evidence points in that direction, and because there is no prior evidence of fires causing towers to near-freefall.

There is a time when discussion about semantics is important, and then there is a time when they are misused. Here it's misused.

Simply stating it's ""likely"" doesn't somehow save you from being a theorist. Not telling us what did bring the towers down doesn't make you not a conspiracy theorist if you still hint at a conspiracy being the most likely case. 

In the first place, there is nothing bad about being a conspiracy theorist or conspiracy theories. It's just that there are so many garbage conspiracy theories today that it has gotten a bad name, real conspiracies happen. And when they do it's important to point out.

There being no prior cases or evidence is not enough to disprove anything. Just because something hasn't happened before doesn't mean it can't happen. Especially since planes crashing into towers isn't exactly an everyday occurrence.

&gt;People who say the official story is certainly true are committing to a conspiracy theory of their own, and are showing a lack of intellectual honesty because they are acting certain when they never could be. 

Yes and no. People who just believe without thinking are indeed being stupid, that doesn't mean everyone who doesn't believe in a conspiracy theory is stupid, and it certainly doesn't mean any one of them even the stupid people of prior mention, are conspiracy theorists. They are not the ones claiming there is a conspiracy, they believe it was an open attack.

So I would argue that it is far more democratic than most other types of lobbying. 

The problem is that the courts recently passed a law allowing union members to stop paying dues but still receive bargaining. Anti union groups hope to break unions by telling people to stop paying their dues because they will get the same benefits. The problem is that this forces the union to increase dues which makes others drop out and it snowballs to kill the union.

"[ A Chinese navy warship armed with what looks like a mounted electromagnetic railgun has apparently set sail, possibly for testing in the open ocean.

The Type 072II Yuting-class tank landing ship Haiyangshan and its weapon were spotted along the Yangtze River at the Wuchang Shipyard in Wuhan earlier this year. ...

Chinese media outlets, such as the state-affiliated Global Times, revealedin March - nearly two months after the first pictures of what was dubbedthe ""Yangtze River Monster"" showed up online - that the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy is ""making notable achievements on advanced weapons, including sea tests of electromagnetic railguns.""

China is expected to field warship-mounted electromagnetic railguns with the ability to fire high-speed projectiles at targets up to 124 miles (200 kilometers) away by 2025, CNBC reported in June, citing US defence sources with direct knowledge of the latest military intelligence reports on China's new naval weapon.

While conventional guns rely on gunpowder to propel projectiles forward, railguns use electromagnetic energy to hurl projectiles at targets downrange at huge speeds, roughly 1.6 miles per second (2.6 kilometers per second), making these weapons desirable next-generation combat systems.

Railguns require significant amounts of power, among other challenging demands. Whether or not China has managed to overcome these developmental issues remains to be seen.

China appears to be making progress as it moves toward possibly mounting railguns on combat-ready warships, such as the new Type 055 stealth destroyers, rather than test bed ships like the Haiyangshan. The US military, on the other hand, has yet to put the powerful gun on a naval vessel even though railgun development began over a decade ago.

It is, however, unclear which country is leading the charge on this new technology, as very little is publicly known about China's railgun or the testing process. In the US, there is speculation that the Zumwalt-class destroyers could eventually feature railguns, a possible alternative to the Advanced Gun System guns that the Navy might end up scrapping. ...]

"&gt;  If all your assests are tied up in real estate that isnt really making money after expenses on paper im worth 10 mil but my cash flow is only like 400k a year.


Maybe if you're all tied up in real estate and you have no cashflow to the point of not being able to pay a fair tax... You shouldn't have that much realestate? 

Housing is a basic need and it's often overlooked how rent is a distribution upwards. With no cashflow is he or she going to be spending money maintaining and improving those homes? Are the tenants only renting because there is no available suitable property and it's hard to get a mortgage in many circumstances?

Perhaps some form of shared ownership is the solution to the problem whilst also solving quite a lot other issues. 

If the owner of the portfolio defaults on their taxes then part of their property is offered up to a tenant as a way of generating the tax revenue that the owner say's they can't pay. It wouldn't even need to transfer to the tenant it could just be backed by a government bond or savings account or whatever. The government then holds any liabilities across the portfolio at a single point against the landlord. If the landlord continues to default up to the value of one property... It is sold (which would look like the government financing the house). 

As the portfolio value reduced they'd be taxed less until it balanced out. Seems like a basic redistribution. 

Perhaps shares in a business would be redistributed the same way, firs to employees as a form of tax releif for the business that say's it can't pay it's tax. Assuming it's a business big enough to have a wage for the owner/ person running it.

It's not aboout stopping people becoming rich. It's about stopping people becoming very very rich compared to literally the average person, and people don't often have access to the mechanisms that would get a fair return for their labour.

"I think it's should be pretty clear we're talking about corporate taxes in this regard. Your point is valid for small privately held organizations; however, more people work at companies with &gt;2500 employees than &lt;100.

"Again, you're right.  Economic rent requires capital or labour. We've established that socialists want an end to economic rent on labour (they want to keep the fruits of their work).  To be in a position to extract the surplus value of labour, you typically need to have invested capital (land, monies, other assets, etc.). 

Capitalism rewards the mobilization of capital through economic rent, a reward for risking that capital in the first place.  

Please note that I'm not advocating for this system or that system, but this debate really is touching on this question: how do we value capital and the role it plays in justifying economic rents on labour. The argument from capitalists is that individual interest from the rich to mobilize capital produces economic goods for all.  I think this is pretty indisputable, but the degree to which this occurs and whether it produces economic goods more efficiently than, say direct redistribution (or any other proposal for taxation of wealth), is the question we're arguing about.

To me, there is a simple metric to answer this question: is the gap between the rich and the poor increasing or decreasing? Currently, this particular handling of wealth is not efficient because this gap is increasing. Of course, the ""ideal"" balance is politics, but this tax is a step in the direction of rectifying this imbalance. Mind you, I am sympathetic to those who would prefer this money went to a basic income or something, rather than general revenue.  There is no guarantee that this money will go where Ocasio Cortez wants it.

In general, I'm really suspicious of the claim that people who make more than $10 million in a year do so solely because their labour is worth that much.  It is almost certainly because their capital is generating the vast majority of it (i.e. they are not working for that wealth and did not ""earn"" it in the same way a middle class person ""earns"" their money). Whether they deserve it, therefore, is not a question of how much they have worked, but of how we as a society value that capital and whether we should mobilize it differently (i.e. publicly).

"I agree it certainly wouldn’t need new law to run the referendum, it just seems like a bad precedent.

Actually I’ve heard mention of the precedent a second referendum being set would create multiple times, the most recent example being one of the PMs answers at PMQs last week.

The reason until very recently that almost no MPs were advocating a second vote was exactly this reason, now there is an escape mechanism! We can have another referendum with a different question (about a deal) - that is the way out. But we can’t ask the same question.

And in reality a lot of the difficulty in this is because parliament didn’t like the outcome (if they had been majority for leave we’d have passed some sort of deal or just left without one). 

I agree with you that leave won because of disingenuous methods! But that isn’t the argument being made by most MPs most MPs are just against the idea of leaving the EU.

And I agree with them however, I ask should a population be able to vote for a situation which is detrimental to their future prosperity? 

I would say yes, it isn’t a good idea but it’s a fundemental human right to be able to.

So we have a situation where the majority of the voters (albeit a small one) voted for this outcome but parliament is something like 75% against it. 

It is very easy in this situation where it is so clear cut to say parliament should express its sovereignty but it is a bad idea.

In a future referendum where parliament for example held a position which would be negative for the general population but still had a referendum, I don’t know It doesn’t really matter but any situation where the will of parliament is against that of the people.

If the people voted no to a referendum that parliament wanted a yes to and chose to ignore the people that would be bad and what we do here could lead to that.

Our leaving the EU will make us poorer in the short term, in the long term (&gt;100 years) it will likely make no difference to the lives of the people. However, giving our government the precedent that it may ignore the democratically expressed will of the people could have consequences for hundreds of years to come. 

We need to find the right way out of this, the right way as far as I can see is to have a referendum based on the following type:

——

Do you wish to accept the currently proposed deal?

Yes

No

If you do not want to accept the deal, do you wish to remain in the EU or leave with no deal.

Remain

Leave

Or a ranked choice vote, deal, no deal, stay. 

That would allow us to get out of this without setting a nasty precedent. As you say it would allow us to vote on something f after it has changed as we’ve done. But it isn’t just asking the same question it’s asking a different one with the options presented.

It’s very clearly been the outcome most high profile remain politicians have been aiming for for about a year now. If it isn’t the positions taken don’t make sense, the deal on the table is much worse than leaving and worse than staying. 

The only reason you would put it before the house was if you wanted it to fail, and unless you believe that a remainer PM is secretly pushing us to no deal the only sensible option is she is trying to walk the house towards voting for a referendum without having to openly advocate for it her self.

I wish she would advocate for it but she politically can’t, if she did then we’d end up with a lunatic in charge of the government. Or a general election which would almost certainly give us a parliament so hung it could very successfully star in porn... Which would make no deal even more likely since it is the default option at this point.

Basically I think we broadly agree I’m just more worried about precedent biting us in the arse latter.",worldnews

While it is indeed true that Sweden's legal definition is wider than that of the Untied States, the *primary* cause for their comparatively staggering numbers actually stems from the way that their legal system records such crimes.

The United States operates on a ***per person*** basis. Should it come to light that some has been repeatedly sexually abusing their child over the past five years, while they'll obviously be facing a much harsher sentence than a comparatively less egregious case, they're still ultimately going to be facing a single charge for every law they violated. 

In Sweden, on the other hand, these crimes are dealt with on a ***per instance*** basis. Where a case identical to the above to arise in Sweden, then that person would be handed a separate charge for each and every occasion that they committed sexual abuse against their child which can be substantiated.

First of all that is factually not true...and second of all even if they came from Middle Eastern countries how does it justify the theft of Palestinian land? Using your same logic then can the Jewish people from Europe who has been living in Israel claim their lost property in Europe?

Lets look at some cold hard number shall we?

First of all as of 2009 there were 5.5 million Jewish people in Israel of which only 37% of had fathers born in Israel..meaning 63% of the Jewish population in Israel were first generation immigrants....

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Israel

Second of all here are the real numbers as of 2009 by the Israeli Government Bureau of Statistics ...read it and weep

the list below shows the countries and the number of Jewish people who were born in those countries but now living in Israel as of 2009

Morocco 486,600

Algeria and Tunisia 120,600

Libya 67,400

Egypt 55,800

Ethiopia 106,900

Turkey 76,900

Iraq 233,500

Yemen 138,300

Iran 134,700

Syria and Lebanon 35,300

total is 1,456,000 Jewish people born in the ""Middle Eastern Countries"" were living in Israel as of 2009...

1.456 million of the 5.523 million total Jewish people in Israel as of 2009 only amounts to only 26% of the current Jewish Israeli population

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Israel

Third of all please keep in mind the ""Middle Eastern Jewish people"" you are using in your argument came to stolen Palestinian land AFTER Israel illegally declared it self a country.

And they came to Israel due to a Israeli sponsored program to increase the Jewish population in the newly created country to increase their hold on the land....and this still continues to this day

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_and_Muslim_countries

&gt;Im just saying the main reason this conflict is such a bid deal is because it involves the jews.

This issue is about stolen land....its a real estate issue, its not a religious issue 


i will leave you with this 

David Ben Gurion (the first Israeli Prime Minister): ""If I were an Arab leader, I would never sign an agreement with Israel. It is normal; we have taken their country. It is true God promised it to us, but how could that interest them? Our God is not theirs. There has been Anti - Semitism, the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their fault ? They see but one thing: we have come and we have stolen their country. Why would they accept that?"" Quoted by Nahum Goldmann in Le Paraddoxe Juif (The Jewish Paradox), pp121.",worldnews

Yes, and because it doesn't have any of that, and won't for a very, very long time, it's not close to what America is. At all.

It's a sui generis system that resembles a confederal system, but is not one. What is hard to understand in this simple sentence? 

I don't know. It's not even a debate. You put the American federation on one side, the European Union on the other. They're just not the same at all. The Lisbon treaty makes it very clear that it avoids as much as possible to even make people think it's close to a federation.




&gt;Aside from the semantic point, what's the difference between that and movement in most federations?

"Well that's true too. Of course you shouldn't believe everything you read either.

The reason why you are made to feel this way is probably how media as a whole changed. Before the internet people would buy the paper with the best reputition. Nowadays reputition means jack shit. Media outlets profit from clicks. To make money, they need to generate clicks. Which they do by blowing stories out of proportion. We talked about Der Spiegel before, that's exactly what happened there, the Journalist wanted to make more money and deliver a bigger story than what the story actually was. Der Spiegel cares about their reputition though, which is why they finger blasted his ass on their frontpage for several days and apologized for the mess.

To add to that no reporter ever will write a totally unbiased article, it is impossible for us humans to stay completely unbiased.

That's why you should question everything you read but at the same time not assume everyone is a liar either. I think healthy sceptecism is necessary.

Just crosscheck with other news sources and you are probably fine. If 3-4 outlets say the same thing, it's probably true. Also when you read something ask yourself always ""Who profits from that?"" ""Who gets damaged by that information?"" ""Is this in line what I already know?"" ""Does it contradict information I already have? In what points? Why?""

To be sure I also recommend checking foreign sources. Most eruopean and even russian media outlets have an english section. You will find another point of view there.

Or you find a media outlet you deem trustworthy.

For me that's Der Spiegel for example. They are not perfect and certainly left leaning yet they don't lie. They at least try to be factual which shows in the fact that they do indeed also publish articles that critize or scrutenize left policies or agendas. 

Their politics and justice section is usually pretty factual and they provide sources which adds tranperancy. 

That being said their social and opinion section is a bit too much imo, every second article there steps a bit into SJW territory, not to much and also labeled as ""opinion"" or ""commentary"" but still a bit out of proportion. What they do really well is that they also publish letters written by readers who respond to that commentary or opinion piece.

"&gt;If a small country of say 1 million people can get 100% renewable energy.. why can't a country with 100 million people

First, because a country with 100 million people has, lets say, 100 times more energy consumption, second, solar panels cost much more in total because the technology in this stage is not very efficient, meaning it would take many solar panels to power up an entire home, let alone a 30 story building. The sheer amount of horizontal space needed to match the demand for energy in todays societies is immense. You would have to cover square kilometres of arable land to power up a city.

&gt;Like.. just add more solar panels. Or windmills. Or dams. Or whatever suits the landscape

Well this might be viable for countries with very little arable land, like the Netherlands, but for developing countries that provide their own food (no imports) it is a suicide to start implementing solar panels. Windmills are very costly. Dams destroy ecosystems and have high maintenance costs.

&gt;It would cost more money to do for a big country of course. But not more money per person. Or would it?

"Christ this level of toxicity has no excuse. 

Let’s take it from the top.

Bolsonaro isn’t the only one who praises the military dictatorship, its a significant portion of the populace as well. As much as it pains to say so, the Brazilian military dictatorships and regimes of days gone by weren’t as bad as most say, if you actually look at the history. 

First let’s visit the Vargas era, who at the top was a “fascist dictator ” (which Brazilian fascists Were trying to overthrow) who modernized the country. Quite literally nicknamed father of the poor. He enacted social security laws, gave women the right to vote, installed worker benefits and a minimum wage. He rose to power in 1930 and committed suicide in 1954. From those I know, he is a beloved icon of the people, responsible for modernizing and helping the country grow immensely. Even after being overthrown as dictator he was still elected to the seat of president.

In 1964 there was another coup which lead to another military dictatorship. Under this military dictatorship, Brazilian GDP grew nearly 10% year over year. Unfortunately, around 400 dissenters would die over the 21 year period. The torture you mention of were trained in American and the UK btw, but the numbers are around 1000.  Considering such small figures, most people tend to focus on the vast growth that the country underwent. So please don’t try to blow out of proportion the numbers. They weren’t torturing or killing everyday people. In 1985 the second republic was established.

The hatred of military regime comes from those who weren’t alive during it. Who only sees the dramatized stories. But those who live through it remember it as time when they weren’t starving or being robbed. 

Please, educate yourself on the history before you come spewing hate. 


Secondly, Bolsonaro is the only choice which would result in any change, as the opposition was literally meeting with the ex president in JAIL to ask for advice.

"They didn't have nukes, but they did believe that a general European war would cause such devastation as to leave no winners, in the same vein as nuclear war. *The Great Illusion* by Norman Angell was an influential book published in 1910 which essentially argued that a war between the great powers was impossible for basically the same reason you stated: 

&gt; ""the economic cost of war was so great that no one could possibly hope to gain by starting a war the consequences of which would be so disastrous.""

Ironically, after been proved 100% wrong not four years later, Norman Angell published a new edition in 1933 reiterating the impossibility of war. I dare say if you asked for the numbers Angell considered most unlucky and played the lottery with them you'd win the jackpot. 

Before World War II there was Giulio Douhet's *The Command of the Air*, the Italian general's treatise on how aerial power has revolutionized warfare, and that the next war would be decided in the opening salvo by the industrial capabilities of both sides being decimated by strategic bombing, which would wipe out all major population centres and create devastation. It was theorized that there was no plausible defense and that the only countermeasure is the threat of your own bombing campaign. 

So you see, both before WWI and WWII, the concepts which surround the modern *Pax Nuclearis* were already established: the idea that great power wars are a lose-lose, completely irrational pursuit, the idea that wars would be decided by a dominant new technology used to decimate civilians, the idea that this new technology cannot be defended against, and the idea that the only way to ward off destruction is mutually assured destruction.

Queuing as a relatable example. In the Uk there are unwritten rules that are held up by almost everyone and those who don't are tutted at heavily.
In China for example queuing is barely even a concept. Same with intellectual property. If you went to China and complained about people not queuing up properly or stealing your idea you'd be foolish. You're in China, you have to live by their laws and social norms even if you don't agree with them and you know that.

Also you made me remember anti-vaxxers but again they're doing harm that they can't see first hand.",worldnews
"I wonder if in the long term, the current Westphalian conception of well-defined nation-states could give way to a notion of “shared sovereignty” where some elements of sovereignty apply on the level of a neighborhood or even a family while others apply on the level of vast, multi-national economic unions like the EU and every level in between, the relations between them being governed by well-defined links, checks, and balances that allows government to work best on their respective appropriate scales without getting too much bigger than it needs to or smaller than it has to. Your national loyalty can remain strong and meaningful while also being joined by loyalty to your city, borough, or larger “superstate”. You can feel connected to your neighbors and to the rest of the world without feeling overly threatened by any of them. But maybe that’s just my own utopian thinking out loud.

At the very least, the EU needs to at least put forth the image of being a lot more democratic and a lot less of the image of a bunch of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats making decisions for an entire continent if the “European project” is to continue. Those that the modern economy is leaving behind need to feel like their concerns are being heard in Brussels, both directly and through the government in Westminster.",worldnews
"No.  Its not a lost position.

We have the knowledge now of the consequences of these actions.  The past doesn't matter.  That rainforest does not belong to the Brazilian people.  It belongs to Earth and all future animals and people. Not just this generation. 

Brazil does not have a right to destroy that ecosystem just like other countries did not have a right to destroy their ecosystems for temporary gain.  ",worldnews
"Wow so are you going to completely ignore that all my relatives live in Venezuela and every month I send supplies and money? I am literally repeating what they tell me, and coming from an upper middle class background my relatives have a lot more than many people there. There are people in my country that can't eat, and the average Venezuelan lost 8 kg in 2016. So, tell me, how are they going to survive if America doesn't intervene? Do they just wait until food starts falling from the sky? Do they just storm the government and get shot?  

It must be easy to judge people by random online profiles, completely ignorant of what their actual real-life situation is. ",worldnews
"Most Congresspeople have attended prestigious universities, family connections and plenty of valuable job experience. You should compare $200k to what the average congress-person could make in the private sector rather than people living at the poverty line. This is a basic econ opportunity cost problem. Bringing up people living at the poverty line is pointless because they don't have nearly the same skills, experience, or advantages that federal level politicians do.",worldnews
"Billionaires are going to have to settle for their bunkers, dying a slightly slower death than the rest of us.

On the other hand, it might be a great idea to load them all on a rocket and send them on their ways. Tell them it'll be fun on Mars! Just like the Hamptons! (wink, wink)",worldnews
"You should really get your facts straight because the evacuation was for the government spokesperson Benjamin Griveau not the interior minister which is Castaner. Furthermore, those who intruded his offices weren't even all wearing yellow vests so they're barely pretending to be a part of the movement. Lastly, even if you're taking the word of Liberation which is as left leaning as it gets without completely losing credibility the numbers reached 50K throughout France.
You really shouldn't get your sources from Twitter...",worldnews
