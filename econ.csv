"Acemoglu D., Johnson S., Robinson J.A.",2001,American Economic Review,"We exploit differences in European mortality rates to estimate the effect of institutions on economic performance. Europeans adopted very different colonization policies in different colonies, with different associated institutions. In places where Europeans faced high mortality rates, they could not settle and were more likely to set up extractive institutions. These institutions persisted to the present. Exploiting differences in European mortality rates as an instrument for current institutions, we estimate large effects of institutions on income per capita. Once the effect of institutions is controlled for, countries in Africa or those closer to the equator do not have lower incomes. (JEL O11, P16, P51)."
"Rajan R.G., Zingales L.",1998,American Economic Review,"This paper examines whether financial development facilitates economic growth by scrutinizing one rationale for such a relationship: that financial development reduces the costs of external finance to firms. Specifically, we ask whether industrial sectors that are relatively more in need of external finance develop disproportionately faster in countries with more-developed financial markets. We find this to be true in a large sample of countries over the 1980's. We show this result is unlikely to be driven by omitted variables, outliers, or reverse causality."
"Anderson J.E., Van Wincoop E.",2003,American Economic Review,"Gravity equations have been widely used to infer trade flow effects of various institutional arrangements. We show that estimated gravity equations do not have a theoretical foundation. This implies both that estimation suffers from omitted variables bias and that comparative statics analysis is unfounded. We develop a method that (i) consistently and efficiently estimates a theoretical gravity equation and (ii) correctly calculates the comparative statics of trade frictions. We apply the method to solve the famous McCallum border puzzle. Applying our method, we find that national borders reduce trade between industrialized countries by moderate amounts of 20-50 percent."
"Levine R., Renelt D.",1992,American Economic Review,"A vast literature uses cross-country regressions to search for empirical linkages between long-run growth rates and a variety of economic policy, political, and institutional indicators. This paper examines whether the conclusions from existing studies are robust or fragile to small changes in the conditioning information set. Almost all results are fragile. It identifies a positive, robust correlation between growth and the share of investment in GDP and between the investment share and the ratio of international trade to GDP. We clarify the conditions under which there is evidence of per capita output convergence. -Authors"
"Bolton G.E., Ockenfels A.",2000,American Economic Review,"We demonstrate that a simple model, constructed on the premise that people are motivated by both their pecuniary payoff and their relative payoff standing, organizes a large and seemingly disparate set of laboratory observations as one consistent pattern. The model is incomplete information but nevertheless posed entirely in terms of directly observable variables. The model explains observations from games where equity is thought to be a factor, such as ultimatum and dictator, games where reciprocity is thought to play a role, such as the prisoner's dilemma and gift exchange, and games where competitive behavior is observed, such as Bertrand markets."
"Fare R., Grosskopf S., Norris M., Zhongyang Zhang",1994,American Economic Review,"This paper analyzes productivity growth in 17 OECD countries over the period 1979-1988. A nonparametric programming method (activity analysis) is used to compute Malmquist productivity indexes. These are decomposed into two component measures, namely, technical change and efficiency change. We find that US productivity growth is slightly higher than average, all of which is due to technical change. Japan's productivity growth is the highest in the sample, with almost half due to efficiency change. -Authors"
"Frankel J.A., Romer D.",1999,American Economic Review,"Examining the correlation between trade and income cannot identify the direction of causation between the two. Countries' geographic characteristics, however, have important effects on trade, and are plausibly uncorrelated with other determinants of income. This paper therefore constructs measures of the geographic component of countries' trade, and uses those measures to obtain instrumental variables estimates of the effect of trade on income. The results provide no evidence that ordinary least-squares estimates overstate the effects of trade. Further, they suggest that trade has a quantitatively large and robust, though only moderately statistically significant, positive effect on income."
Krugman P.,1980,American Economic Review,"Presents a simple formal analysis which incorporates elements of scale economies, the possibility of product differentiation and imperfect competition, showing how it can be used to shed light on issues that cannot be handled by more conventional models, like the causes of trade between economies with similar factor endowments, and the role of a large domestic market in encouraging exports.-after Author"
"Levine R., Zervos S.",1998,American Economic Review,"Do well-functioning stock markets and banks promote long-run economic growth? This paper shows that stock market liquidity and banking development both positively predict growth, capital accumulation, and productivity improvements when entered together in regressions, even after controlling for economic and political factors. The results are consistent with the views that financial markets provide important services for growth, and that stock markets provide different services from banks. The paper also finds that stock market size, volatility, and international integration are not robustly linked with growth, and that none of the financial indicators is closely associated with private saving rates."
"Bernanke B., Gertler M.",1989,American Economic Review,"This paper develops a simple neoclassical model of the business cycle in which condition of borrowers' balance sheets is a source of output dynamics. The mechanism is that higher borrower net worth reduces the agency costs of financing real capital investments. Business upturns improve net worth, lower agency costs, and increase investment, which amplifies the upturn; vice versa, for downturns. Shocks that affect net worth (as in a debt-deflation) can initiate fluctuations. © 1989, American Economic Association. All rights reserved."
"Kaminsky G.L., Reinhart C.M.",1999,American Economic Review,"In the wake of the Mexican and Asian currency turmoil, the subject of financial crises has come to the forefront of academic and policy discussions. This paper analyzes the links between banking and currency crises. We find that: problems in the banking sector typically precede a currency crisis - the currency crisis deepens the banking crisis, activating a vicious spiral; financial liberalization often precedes banking crises. The anatomy of these episodes suggests that crises occur as the economy enters a recession, following a prolonged boom in economic activity that was fueled by credit, capital inflows, and accompanied by an overvalued currency."
"Blanchard O.J., Quah D.",1989,American Economic Review,"We interpret fluctuations in GNP and unemployment as due to two types of disturbances: disturbances that have a permanent effect on output and distur- bances that do not. We interpret the first as supply disturbances, the second as demand disturbances. Demand disturbances have a hump-shaped mirror-image effect on output and unemployment. The effect of supply disturbances on output increases steadily over time, peaking after two years and reaching a plateau after five years."
"Smets F., Wouters R.",2007,American Economic Review,"Using a Bayesian likelihood approach, we estimate a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model for the US economy using seven macroeconomic time series. The model incorporates many types of real and nominal frictions and seven types of structural shocks. We show that this model is able to compete with Bayesian Vector Autoregression models in out-of-sample prediction. We investigate the relative empirical importance of the various frictions. Finally, using the estimated model, we address a number of key issues in business cycle analysis: What are the sources of business cycle fluctuations? Can the model explain the cross correlation between output and inflation? What are the effects of productivity on hours worked? What are the sources of the ""Great Moderation""?"
"Aitken B.J., Harrison A.E.",1999,American Economic Review,"Governments often promote inward foreign investment to encourage technology ""spillovers"" from foreign to domestic firms. Using panel data on Venezuelan plants, we find that foreign equity participation is positively correlated with plant productivity (the ""own-plant"" effect), but this relationship is only robust for small enterprises. We then test for spillovers from joint ventures to plants with no foreign investment. Foreign investment negatively affects the productivity of domestically owned plants. The net impact of foreign investment, taking into account these two offsetting effects, is quite small. The gains from foreign investment appear to be entirely captured by joint ventures."
"Burnside C., Dollar D.",2000,American Economic Review,"This paper uses a new database on foreign aid to examine the relationships among foreign aid, economic policies, and growth of per capita GDP. We find that aid has a positive impact on growth in developing countries with good fiscal, monetary, and trade policies but has little effect in the presence of poor policies. Good policies are ones that are themselves important for growth. The quality of policy has only a small impact on the allocation of aid. Our results suggest that aid would be more effective if it were more systematically conditioned on good policy. (JEL F350, O230, O400)."
North D.C.,1994,American Economic Review,This essay is about institutions and time. It does not provide a theory of economic dynamics comparable to general equilibrium theory. Rather it provides the initial scaffolding of an analytical framework capable of increasing our understanding of the historical evolution of economies and a necessarily crude guide to policy in the ongoing task of improving the economic performance of economies. The analytical framework is a modification of neoclassical theory. What it retains is the fundamental assumption of scarcity and hence competition and the analytical tools of microeconomic theory. What it modifies is the rationality assumption. What it adds is the dimension of time. -from Author
"Persson T., Tabellini G.",1994,American Economic Review,"Is inequality harmful for growth? We suggest that it is. In a society where distributional conflict is important, political decisions produce economic policies that are investment and growth-promoting activities in order to redistribute income. The paper formulates a theoretical model that captures this idea. The model's implications are supported by the evidence. Both historical panel data and postwar cross sections indicate a significant and large negative relation between inequality and growth. This relation is only present in democracies. -Authors"
"Ichniowski C., Shaw K., Prennushi G.",1997,American Economic Review,"We investigate the productivity effects of innovative employment practices using data from a sample of 36 homogeneous steel production lines owned by 17 companies. The productivity regressions demonstrate that lines using a set of innovative work practices, which include incentive pay, teams, flexible job assignments, employment security, and training, achieve substantially higher levels of productivity than do lines with the more traditional approach, which includes narrow job definitions, strict work rules, and hourly pay with close supervision. Our results are consistent with recent theoretical models which stress the importance of complementarities among work practices."
Javorcik B.S.,2004,American Economic Review,"Many countries strive to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) hoping that knowledge brought by multinationals will spill over to domestic industries and increase their productivity. In contrast with earlier literature that failed to find positive intraindustry spillovers from FDI, this study focuses on effects operating across industries. The analysis, based on firm-level data from Lithuania, produces evidence consistent with positive productivity spillovers from FDI taking place through contacts between foreign affiliates and their local suppliers in upstream sectors. The data indicate that spillovers are associated with projects with shared domestic and foreign ownership but not with fully owned foreign investments."
"Bernanke B.S., Blinder A.S.",1992,American Economic Review,"We show that the interest rate on Federal funds is extremely informative about future movements of real macroeconomic variables. Then we argue that the reason for this forecasting success is that the funds rate sensitively records shocks to the supply of bank reserves; that is, the funds rate is a good indicator of monetary policy actions. Finally, using innovations to the funds rate as a measure of changes in policy, we present evidence consistent with the view that monetary policy works at least in part through ""credit"" (i.e., bank loans) as well as through ""money"" (i.e., bank deposits). (JEL E52)."
"Scharfstein D.S., Stein J.C.",1990,American Economic Review,"This paper examines some of the forces that can lead to herd behavior in investment. Under certain circumstances, managers simply mimic the investment decisions of other managers, ignoring substantive private information. Although this behavior is inefficient from a social standpoint, it can be rational from the perspective of managers who are concerned about their reputations in the labor market. We discuss applications of the model to corporate investment, the stockmarket, and decision making within firms. -Authors"
"O'Donoghue T., Rabin M.",1999,American Economic Review,"We examine self-control problems - modeled as time-inconsistent, present-biased preferences - in a model where a person must do an activity exactly once. We emphasize two distinctions: Do activities involve immediate costs or immediate rewards, and are people sophisticated or naive about future self-control problems? Naive people procrastinate immediate-cost activities and preproperate - do too soon - immediate-reward activities. Sophistication mitigates procrastination, but exacerbates preproperation. Moreover, with immediate costs, a small present bias can severely harm only naive people, whereas with immediate rewards it can severely harm only sophisticated people. Lessons for savings, addiction, and elsewhere are discussed."
Klepper S.,1996,American Economic Review,"Regularities concerning how entry, exit, market structure, and innovation vary from the birth of technologically progressive industries through maturity are summarized. A model emphasizing differences infirm innovative capabilities and the importance of firm size in appropriating the returns from innovation is developed to explain the regularities. The model also explains regularities regarding the relationship within industries between firm size and firm innovative effort, innovative productivity, cost, and profitability. It predicts that over time firms devote more effort to process innovation but the number of firms and the rate and diversity of product innovation eventually wither."
"Abadie A., Gardeazabal J.",2003,American Economic Review,"This article investigates the economic effects of conflict, using the terrorist conflict in the Basque Country as a case study. We find that, after the outbreak of terrorism in the late 1960's, per capita GDP in the Basque Country declined about 10 percentage points relative to a synthetic control region without terrorism. In addition, we use the 1998-1999 truce as a natural experiment. We find that stocks of firms with a significant part of their business in the Basque Country showed a positive relative performance when truce became credible, and a negative relative performance at the end of the cease-fire."
"Ciccone A., Hall R.E.",1996,American Economic Review,To explain the large differences in labor productivity across U.S. states we estimate two models-one based on local geographical externalities and the other on the diversity of local intermediate services-where spatial density results in aggregate increasing returns. Both models lead to a relation between county employment density and productivity at the state level. Using data on gross state output we find that a doubling of employment density increases average labor productivity by around 6 percent. More than half of the variance of output per worker across states can be explained by differences in the density of economic activity.
"Bénabou R., Tirole J.",2006,American Economic Review,"We develop a theory of prosocial behavior that combines heterogeneity in individual altruism and greed with concerns for social reputation or self-respect. Rewards or punishments (whether material or image-related) create doubt about the true motive for which good deeds are performed, and this ""overjustification effect"" can induce a partial or even net crowding out of prosocial behavior by extrinsic incentives. We also identify the settings that are conducive to multiple social norms and, more generally, those that make individual actions complements or substitutes, which we show depends on whether stigma or honor is (endogenously) the dominant reputational concern. Finally, we analyze the socially optimal level of incentives and how monopolistic or competitive sponsors depart from it. Sponsor competition is shown to potentially reduce social welfare."
"Manning W.G., Newhouse J.P., Duan N., Keeler E.B., Leibowitz A., Marquis M.S.",1987,American Economic Review,"We estimate how cost sharing, the portion of the bill the patient pays, affects the demand for medical services. The data come from a randomized experiment. A catastrophic insurance plan reduces expenditures 31 percent relative to zero out-of-pocket price. The price elasticity is approximately -0.2. We reject the hypothesis that less favorable coverage of outpatient services increases total expenditure (for example, by deterring preventive care or inducing hospitalization)."
"Hermalin B.E., Weisbach M.S.",1998,American Economic Review,"How can boards be chosen through a process partially controlled by the CEO, yet, in many instances, still be effective monitors of him? We offer an answer based on a model in which board effectiveness is a function of its independence. This, in turn, is a function of negotiations (implicit or explicit) between existing directors and the CEO over who will fill vacancies on the board. The CEO's bargaining power over the board-selection process comes from his perceived ability relative to potential successors. Many empirical findings about board structure and performance arise as equilibrium phenomena of this model."
"Card D., Krueger A.B.",1994,American Economic Review,"On April 1, 1992, New Jersey's minimum wage rose from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour. To evaluate the impact of the law we surveyed 410 fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania before and after the rise. Comparisons of employment growth at stores in New Jersey and Pennsylvania (where the minimum wage was constant) provide simple estimates of the effect of the higher minimum wage. The authors compare employment changes at stores in New Jersey that were initially paying high wages (above $5) to the changes at lower-wage stores. The authors find no indication that the rise in the minimum wage reduced employment. -Authors"
"Feenstra R.C., Inklaar R., Timmer M.P.",2015,American Economic Review,"We describe the theory and practice of real GDP comparisons across countries and over time. Version 8 of the Penn World Table expands on previous versions in three respects. First, in addition to comparisons of living standards using components of real GDP on the expenditure side, we provide a measure of productive capacity, called real GDP on the output side. Second, growth rates are benchmarked to multiple years of cross-country price data so they are less sensitive to new benchmark data. Third, data on capital stocks and productivity are (re)introduced. Applications including the Balassa-Samuelson effect and development accounting are discussed."
"Antweiler W., Copeland B.R., Taylor M.S.",2001,American Economic Review,"This paper investigates how openness to international goods markets affects pollution concentrations. We develop a theoretical model to divide trade's impact on pollution into scale, technique, and composition effects and then examine this theory using data on sulfur dioxide concentrations. We find international trade creates relatively small changes in pollution concentrations when it alters the composition of national output. Estimates of the trade-induced technique and scale effects imply a net reduction in pollution from these sources. Combining our estimates of all three effects yields a somewhat surprising conclusion: freer trade appears to be good for the environment."
"Bernard A.B., Eaton J., Jensen J.B., Kortum S.",2003,American Economic Review,"We reconcile trade theory with plant-level export behavior, extending the Ricardian model to accommodate many countries, geographic barriers, and imperfect competition. Our model captures qualitatively basic facts about U.S. plants: (i) productivity dispersion, (ii) higher productivity among exporters, (iii) the small fraction who export, (iv) the small fraction earned from exports among exporting plants, and (v) the size advantage of exporters. Fitting the model to bilateral trade among the United States and 46 major trade partners, we examine the impact of globalization and dollar appreciation on productivity, plant entry and exit, and labor turnover in U.S. manufacturing."
Keeley M.C.,1990,American Economic Review,"A fixed-rate deposit insurance system provides a moral hazard for excessive risk taking and is not viable absent regulation. Although the deposit insurance system appears to have worked remarkably well over most of its S0-year history, major problems began to appear in the early 1980's. This paper tests the hypothesis that increases in competition caused bank charter values to decline, which in turn caused banks to increase default risk through increases in asset risk and reductions in capital.

"Erev I., Roth A.E.",1998,American Economic Review,"We examine learning in all experiments we could locate involving 100 periods or more of games with a unique equilibrium in mixed strategies, and in a new experiment. We study both the ex post (""best fit"") descriptive power of learning models, and their ex ante predictive power, by simulating each experiment using parameters estimated from the other experiments. Even a one-parameter reinforcement learning model robustly outperforms the equilibrium predictions. Predictive power is improved by adding ""forgetting"" and ""experimentation,"" or by allowing greater rationality as in probabilistic fictitious play. Implications for developing a low-rationality, cognitive game theory are discussed."
Lucas Jr R.E.,1990,American Economic Review,"The egalitarian predictions of the simplest neoclassical models of trade and growth are well known and easy to explain, as they follow from entirely standard assumptions on technology alone. We do see some investment by wealthy countries in poorer ones, but an example with some rough numbers will help to make clear just how far the capital flows we observe fall short of the flows predicted by such theories. If this model were anywhere close to being accurate, and if world capital markets were anywhere close to being free and complete, it is clear that, in the face of return differentials of this magnitude, investment goods would flow rapidly from the US and other wealthy countries to India and other poor countries. -from Author"
"Guiso L., Sapienza P., Zingales L.",2004,American Economic Review,"To identify the effect of social capital on financial development, we exploit social capital differences within Italy. In high-social-capital areas, households are more likely to use checks, invest less in cash and more in stock, have higher access to institutional credit, and make less use of informal credit. The effect of social capital is stronger where legal enforcement is weaker and among less educated people. These results are not driven by omitted environmental variables, since we show that the behavior of movers is still affected by the level of social capital of the province where they were born."
"Mendelsohn R., Nordhaus W.D., Shaw D.",1994,American Economic Review,"We measure the economic impact of climate on land prices. Using cross-sectional data on climate, farmland prices, and other economic and geophysical data for almost 3000 counties in the US, we find that higher temperatures in all seasons except autumn reduce average farm values, while more precipitation outside of autumn increases farm values. Applying the model to a global-warming scenario shows a significantly lower estimated impact of global warming on US agriculture than the traditional production-function approach and, in one case, suggests that, even without CO2 fertilization, global warming may have economic benefits for agriculture. -Authors"
"Galor O., Weil D.N.",2000,American Economic Review,"This paper develops a unified growth model that captures the historical evolution of population, technology, and output. It encompasses the endogenous transition between three regimes that have characterized economic development. The economy evolves from a Malthusian regime, where technological progress is slow and population growth prevents any sustained rise in income per capita, into a Post-Malthusian regime, where technological progress rises and population growth absorbs only part of output growth. Ultimately, a demographic transition reverses the positive relationship between income and population growth, and the economy enters a Modern Growth regime with reduced population growth and sustained income growth.

"Case K.E., Shiller R.J.",1989,American Economic Review,"The market for single-family homes does not appear to be efficient. Year-to-year changes in prices tend to be followed by changes in the same direction in the subsequent year. Moreover, information about real interest rates does not appear to be incorporated in prices. There is thus a profitable trading rule for persons who are free to time the purchase of their homes. Still, overall, individual housing price changes are not very forecastable. -Authors"
"Cunha F., Heckman J.",2007,American Economic Review,"A technology of cognitive and noncognitive skill formation that features self-productivity, dynamic complementarity, and skill multipliers explains a variety of findings established in the child development and child intervention literatures. Although we have focused on cognitive and noncognitive skills, our analysis also applies to the formation of physical health capital (see Heckman 2007). The evidence on the importance of early childhood environments on adult health (David J. P. Barker 1998; and Anne Case, Angela Fertig, and Christina Paxson 2005) can be rationalized by our technology. Stocks of cognitive and noncognitive skills facilitate the accumulation of health capital through self-regulation and choices. Stocks of health skills also raise the productivity of schooling (Alok Bhargava 2008)."
"Autor D.H., Dorn D., Hanson G.H.",2013,American Economic Review,"We analyze the effect of rising Chinese import competition between 1990 and 2007 on US local labor markets, exploiting cross- market variation in import exposure stemming from initial differences in industry specialization and instrumenting for US imports using changes in Chinese imports by other high-income countries. Rising imports cause higher unemployment, lower labor force participation, and reduced wages in local labor markets that house importcompeting manufacturing industries. In our main specification, import competition explains one-quarter of the contemporaneous aggregate decline in US manufacturing employment. Transfer benefits payments for unemployment, disability, retirement, and healthcare also rise sharply in more trade-exposed labor markets."
Lazear E.P.,2000,American Economic Review,"Much of the theory in personnel economics relates to effects of monetary incentives on output, but the theory was untested because appropriate data were unavailable. A new data set for the Safelite Glass Corporation tests the predictions that average productivity will rise, the firm will attract a more able workforce, and variance in output across individuals at the firm will rise when it shifts to piece rates. In Safelite, productivity effects amount to a 44-percent increase in output per worker. This firm apparently had selected a suboptimal compensation system, as profits also increased with the change."
Shimer R.,2005,American Economic Review,"This paper argues that the textbook search and matching model cannot generate the observed business-cycle-frequency fluctuations in unemployment and job vacancies in response to shocks of a plausible magnitude. In the United States, the standard deviation of the vacancy-unemployment ratio is almost 20 times as large as the standard deviation of average labor productivity, while the search model predicts that the two variables should have nearly the same volatility. A shock that changes average labor productivity primarily alters the present value of wages, generating only a small movement along a downward-sloping Beveridge curve (unemployment-vacancy locus). A shock to the separation rate generates a counterfactually positive correlation between unemployment and vacancies. In both cases, the model exhibits virtually no propagation."
"Jacobson L.S., Lalonde R.J., Sullivan D.G.",1993,American Economic Review,"We exploit administrative data combining Pennsylvanian workers' earning histories with information about their firms to estimate the magnitude and temporal pattern of displaced worker's earnings losses. We find that high-tenure workers separating from distressed firms suffer long-term losses averaging 25% per year. We find that displaced workers' losses: begin mounting before their separations, depend only slightly on their age and sex, depend more on local labor-market conditions and their former indsutries, are not, however, limited to those in a few sectors, and are larger even for those who find new jobs in similar firms. -Authors"
Iacoviello M.,2005,American Economic Review,"I develop and estimate a monetary business cycle model with nominal loans and collateral constraints tied to housing values. Demand shocks move housing and nominal prices in the same direction, and are amplified and propagated over time. The financial accelerator is not uniform: nominal debt dampens supply shocks, stabilizing the economy under interest rate control. Structural estimation supports two key model features: collateral effects dramatically improve the response of aggregate demand to housing price shocks; and nominal debt improves the sluggish response of output to inflation surprises. Finally, policy evaluation considers the role of house prices and debt indexation in affecting monetary policy trade-offs."
"Edelman B., Ostrovsky M., Schwarz M.",2007,American Economic Review,"We investigate the ""generalized second-price"" (GSP) auction, a new mechanism used by search engines to sell online advertising. Although GSP looks similar to the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, its properties are very different. Unlike the VCG mechanism, GSP generally does not have an equilibrium in dominant strategies, and truth-telling is not an equilibrium of GSP. To analyze the properties of GSP, we describe the generalized English auction that corre-sponds to GSP and show that it has a unique equilibrium. This is an ex post equilibrium, with the same payoffs to all players as the dominant strategy equilibrium of VCG."
"Sala-i-Martin X., Doppelhofer G., Miller R.I.",2004,American Economic Review,"This paper examines the robustness of explanatory variables in cross-country economic growth regressions. It introduces and employs a novel approach, Bayesian Averaging of Classical Estimates (BACE), which constructs estimates by averaging OLS coefficients across models. The weights given to individual regressions have a Bayesian justification similar to the Schwarz model selection criterion. Of 67 explanatory variables we find 18 to be significantly and robustly partially correlated with long-term growth and another three variables to be marginally related. The strongest evidence is for the relative price of investment, primary school enrollment, and the initial level of real GDP per capita."
"Faccio M., Lang L.H.P., Young L.",2001,American Economic Review,"Whereas most U.S. corporations are widely held, the predominant form of ownership in East Asia is control by a family, which often supplies a top manager. These features of ""crony capitalism"" are actually more pronounced in Western Europe. In both regions, the salient agency problem is expropriation of outside shareholders by controlling shareholders. Dividends provide evidence on this. Group-affiliated corporations in Europe pay higher dividends than in Asia, dampening insider expropriation. Dividend rates are higher in Europe, but lower in Asia, when there are multiple large shareholders, suggesting that they dampen expropriation in Europe, but exacerbate it in Asia. (JEL G34, G35)."
"Roberts M.J., Tybout J.R.",1997,American Economic Review,"Recent theoretical models of entry predict that, in the presence of sunk costs, current market participation is affected by prior experience. This paper quantifies the effect of prior exporting experience on the decisions of Colombian manufacturing plants to participate in foreign markets. It develops a dynamic discrete-choice model of exporting behavior that separates the roles of profit heterogeneity and sunk entry costs in explaining plants' exporting status. Sunk costs are found to be significant, and prior export experience is shown to increase the probability of exporting by as much as 60 percentage points. (JEL F10, L10, C25)."
Yifu Lin J.,1992,American Economic Review,"This paper employs province-level panel data to assess the contributions of decollectivization, price adjustments, and other reforms to China's agricultural growth in the reform period. Decollectivization is found to improve total factor productivity and to account for about half of the output growth during 1978-1984. The adjustment in state procurement prices also contributed positively to output growth. Its impact came mainly from the responses in input use. The effect of other market-related reforms on productivity and output growth was very small. Reasons for slowdown in agricultural growth after 1984 are also analyzed. -Author"
"Hanushek E.A., Kimko D.D.",2000,American Economic Review,"Direct measures of labor-force quality from international mathematics and science test scores are strongly related to growth. Indirect specification tests are generally consistent with a causal link: direct spending on schools is unrelated to student performance differences; the estimated growth effects of improved labor-force quality hold when East Asian countries are excluded; and, finally, home-country quality differences of immigrants are directly related to U.S. earnings if the immigrants are educated in their own country but not in the United States. The last estimates of micro productivity effects, however, introduce uncertainty about the magnitude of the growth effects."
"Autor D.H., Dorn D.",2013,American Economic Review,"We offer a unified analysis of the growth of low-skill service occupations between 1980 and 2005 and the concurrent polarization of US employment and wages. We hypothesize that polarization stems from the interaction between consumer preferences, which favor variety over specialization, and the falling cost of automating routine, codifiable job tasks. Applying a spatial equilibrium model, we corroborate four implications of this hypothesis. Local labor markets that specialized in routine tasks differentially adopted information technology, reallocated low-skill labor into service occupations (employment polarization), experienced earnings growth at the tails of the distribution (wage polarization), and received inflows of skilled labor."
"Case A., Lubotsky D., Paxson C.",2002,American Economic Review,"The well-known positive association between health and income in adulthood has antecedents in childhood. Not only is children's health positively related to household income, but the relationship between household income and children's health becomes more pronounced as children age. Part of the relationship can be explained by the arrival and impact of chronic conditions. Children from lower-income households with chronic conditions have worse health than do those from higher-income households. The adverse health effects of lower income accumulate over children's lives. Part of the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status may work through the impact of parents' income on children's health."
"Kashyap A.K., Stein J.C.",2000,American Economic Review,"We study the monetary-transmission mechanism with a data set that includes quarterly observations of every insured U.S. commercial bank from 1976 to 1993. We find that the impact of monetary policy on lending is stronger for banks with less liquid balance sheets - i.e., banks with lower ratios of securities to assets. Moreover, this pattern is largely attributable to the smaller banks, those in the bottom 95 percent of the size distribution. Our results support the existence of a ""bank lending channel"" of monetary transmission, though they do not allow us to make precise statements about its quantitative importance."
"Bound J., Johnson G.",1992,American Economic Review,"During the 1980's, a period in which the average level of real wage rates was roughly stagnant, there were large changes in the structure of relative wages, most notably a huge increase in the relative wages of highly educated workers. This paper attempts to assess the power of several alternative explanations of the observed relative wage changes in the context of a theoretical framework that nests all of these explanations. Our conclusion is that their major cause was a shift in the skill structure of labor demand brought about by biased technological change. -Authors"

While capital-requirement regulation can induce prudent behavior the policy yields Pareto-inefficient outcomes. Capital requirements reduce gambling incentives by putting bank equity at risk. However, they also have a perverse effect of harming banks' franchise values, thus encouraging gambling. Pareto-efficient outcomes can be achieved by adding deposit-rate controls as a regulatory instrument since they facilitate prudent investment by increasing franchise values. Even if deposit-rate ceilings are not binding on the equilibrium path they may be useful in deterring gambling off the equilibrium path."
Forbes K.J.,2000,American Economic Review,"This paper challenges the current belief that income inequality has a negative relationship with economic growth. It uses an improved data set on income inequality which not only reduces measurement error, but also allows estimation via a panel technique. Panel estimation makes it possible to control for time-invariant country-specific effects, therefore eliminating a potential source of omitted-variable bias. Results suggest that in the short and medium term, an increase in a country's level of income inequality has a significant positive relationship with subsequent economic growth. This relationship is highly robust across samples, variable definitions, and model specifications. (JEL O40, O15, E25)."
Solon G.,1992,American Economic Review,"Social scientists and policy analysts have long expressed concern about the extent of intergenerational income mobility in the US but remarkably little empirical evidence is available. The few existing estimates of the intergenerational correlation in income have been biased downward by measurement error, unrepresentative samples, or both. new estimates based on intergenerational data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics imply that the intergenerational correlation in long-run income is at least 0.4, indicating dramatically less mobility than suggested by earlier research. -Author"
"Grossman G.M., Rossi-Hansberg E.",2008,American Economic Review,"We propose a theory of the global production process that focuses on tradeable tasks, and use it to study how falling costs of offshoring affect factor prices in the source country. We identify a productivity effect of task trade that benefits the factor whose tasks are more easily moved offshore. In the light of this effect, reductions in the cost of trading tasks can generate shared gains for all domestic factors, in contrast to the distributional conflict that typically results from reductions in the cost of trading goods."
Lael Brainard S.,1997,American Economic Review,"This paper examines the extent to which multinational location decisions reflect a trade-off between achieving proximity to customers and concentrating production to achieve scale economies. It finds that overseas production by multinationals increases relative to exports the higher are transport costs and trade barriers and the lower are investment barriers and scale economies at the plant level relative to the corporate level. However, it is not possible to reject a model with only country and industry effects. The evidence also suggests that multinational activity is more likely the more similar are the home and foreign markets -contrary to conventional wisdom. (JEL F12, F21, F23)."
Small K.A.,1982,American Economic Review,"Demonstrates that the scheduling of activities by consumers can be explicitly modeled in a theoretically satisfactory and empirically productive way. Even in the case of urban work trips, probably one of the most tightly constrained of everyday activities, schedule shifting is found to be of quantitative importance for the understanding of urban transportation systems. It seems likely that this approach can be applied productively to other goods subject to peaked demands, including electricity, telephone service, computer services, and products with seasonal demands. In short, much of economic analysis could be profitably modified to include scheduling behaviour.-from Author"
"Acemoglu D., Aghion P., Bursztyn L., Hemous D.",2012,American Economic Review,"This paper introduces endogenous and directed technical change in a growth model with environmental constraints. The final good is produced from ""dirty"" and ""clean"" inputs. We show that: (i) when inputs are sufficiently substitutable, sustainable growth can be achieved with temporary taxes/subsidies that redirect innovation toward clean inputs; (ii) optimal policy involves both ""carbon taxes"" and research subsidies, avoiding excessive use of carbon taxes; (iii) delay in intervention is costly, as it later necessitates a longer transition phase with slow growth; and (iv) use of an exhaustible resource in dirty input production helps the switch to clean innovation under laissez-faire."
"Chetty R., Looney A., Kroft K.",2009,American Economic Review,"Using two strategies, we show that consumers underreact to taxes that are not salient. First, using a field experiment in a grocery store, we find that posting tax-inclusive price tags reduces demand by 8 percent. Second, increases in taxes included in posted prices reduce alcohol consumption more than increases in taxes applied at the register. We develop a theoretical framework for applied welfare analysis that accommodates salience effects and other optimization failures. The simple formulas we derive imply that the economic incidence of a tax depends on its statutory incidence, and that even policies that induce no change in behavior can create efficiency losses.

"Lochner L., Moretti E.",2004,American Economic Review,"We estimate the effect of education on participation in criminal activity using changes in state compulsory schooling laws over time to account for the endogeneity of schooling decisions. Using Census and FBI data, we find that schooling significantly reduces the probability of incarceration and arrest. NLSY data indicate that our results are caused by changes in criminal behavior and not differences in the probability of arrest or incarceration conditional on crime. We estimate that the social savings from crime reduction associated with high school graduation (for men) is about 14-26 percent of the private return."
"Hummels D., Klenow P.J.",2005,American Economic Review,"Large economies export more in absolute terms than do small economies. We use data on shipments by 126 exporting countries to 59 importing countries in 5,000 product categories to answer the question: How? Do big economies export larger quantities of each good (the intensive margin), a wider set of goods (the extensive margin), or higher-quality goods? We find that the extensive margin accounts for around 60 percent of the greater exports of larger economies. Within categories, richer countries export higher quantities at modestly higher prices. We compare these findings to some workhorse trade models. Models with Armington national product differentiation have no extensive margin, and incorrectly predict lower prices for the exports of larger economies. Models with Krugman firm-level product differentiation do feature a prominent extensive margin, but overpredict the rate at which variety responds to exporter size. Models with quality differentiation, meanwhile, can match the price facts. Finally, models with fixed costs of exporting to a given market might explain the tendency of larger economies to export a given product to more countries."
"Morris S., Shin H.S.",2002,American Economic Review,"What are the welfare effects of enhanced dissemination of public information through the media and disclosures by market participants with high public visibility? We examine the impact of public information in a setting where agents take actions appropriate to the underlying fundamentals, but they also have a coordination motive arising from a strategic complementarity in their actions. When the agents have no socially valuable private information, greater provision of public information always increases welfare. However, when agents also have access to independent sources of information, the welfare effect of increased public disclosures is ambiguous."
"Acemoglu D., Johnson S., Robinson J.",2005,American Economic Review,"The rise of Western Europe after 1500 is due largely to growth in countries with access to the Atlantic Ocean and with substantial trade with the New World, Africa, and Asia via the Atlantic. This trade and the associated colonialism affected Europe not only directly, but also indirectly by inducing institutional change. Where ""initial"" political institutions (those established before 1500) placed significant checks on the monarchy, the growth of Atlantic trade strengthened merchant groups by constraining the power of the monarchy, and helped merchants obtain changes in institutions to protect property rights. These changes were central to subsequent economic growth."
"Röller L.-H., Waverman L.",2001,American Economic Review,"In this paper we investigate how telecommunications infrastructure affects economic growth. We use evidence from 21 OECD countries over a 20-year period to examine the impacts that telecommunications developments may have had. We jointly estimate a micromodel for telecommunication investment with a macro production function. We find evidence of a significant positive causal link, especially when a critical mass of telecommunications infrastructure is present. Interestingly, the critical mass appears to be at a level of telecommunications infrastructure that is near universal service."
Fogel R.W.,1994,American Economic Review,"This lecture sketches a theory of the secular decline in morbidity and mortality that takes account of changes induced in physiological functioning since 1700. The synergism between technological and physiological improvements has produced a form of human evolution, biological though not genetic, rapid, culturally transmitted, and not necessarily stable, which is still ongoing in both OECD and developing countries. Thermodynamic and physiological aspects of economic growth are defined and their impact on growth rates is assessed. Implications of this theory for population forecasting, measurement of national income, demand for leisure, pension policies, and demand for health care are considered. -from Author"
"Jurado K., Ludvigson S.C., Ng S.",2015,American Economic Review,"This paper exploits a data rich environment to provide direct econometric estimates of time-varying macroeconomic uncertainty. Our estimates display significant independent variations from popular uncertainty proxies, suggesting that much of the variation in the proxies is not driven by uncertainty. Quantitatively important uncertainty episodes appear far more infrequently than indicated by popular uncertainty proxies, but when they do occur, they are larger, more persistent, and are more correlated with real activity. Our estimates provide a benchmark to evaluate theories for which uncertainty shocks play a role in business cycles."
"Bils M., Klenow P.J.",2000,American Economic Review,A number of economists find that growth and schooling are highly correlated across countries. A model is examined in which the ability to build on the human capital of one's elders plays an important role in linking growth to schooling. The model is calibrated to quantify the strength of the effect of schooling on growth by using evidence from the labor literature on Mincerian returns to education. The upshot is that the impact of schooling on growth explains less than one-third of the empirical cross-country relationship. The ability of reverse causality to explain this empirical relationship is also investigated.
"Foster L., Haltiwanger J., Syverson C.",2008,American Economic Review,"We investigate the nature of selection and productivity growth in industries where we observe producer-level quantities and prices separately. We show there are important differences between revenue and physical productivity. Because physical productivity is inversely correlated with price while revenue productivity is positively correlated with price, previous work linking (revenue-based) productivity to survival confounded the separate and opposing effects of technical efficiency and demand on survival, understating the true impacts of both. Further, we find that young producers charge lower prices than incumbents. Thus the literature understates new producers' productivity advantages and entry's contribution to aggregate productivity growth."
Rose A.K.,2004,American Economic Review,"This paper estimates the effect on international trade of multilateral trade agreements - the World Trade Organization (WTO), its predecessor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) extended from rich countries to developing countries. I use a standard ""gravity"" model of bilateral merchandise trade and a large panel data set covering over 50 years and 175 countries. An extensive search reveals little evidence that countries joining or belonging to the GATT/WTO have different trade patterns from outsiders, though the GSP seems to have a strong effect."
"Duranton G., Puga D.",2001,American Economic Review,"This paper develops microfoundations for the role that diversified cities play in fostering innovation. A simple model of process innovation is proposed, where firms learn about their ideal production process by making prototypes. We build around this a dynamic general-equilibrium model, and derive conditions under which diversified and specialized cities coexist. New products are developed in diversified cities, trying processes borrowed from different activities. On finding their ideal process, firms switch to mass production and relocate to specialized cities where production costs are lower. We find strong evidence of this pattern in establishment relocations across French employment areas 1993-1996. (JEL R30, O31, D83)."

Using data from actual auditions, in an individual fixed-effects framework, we find that the screen increases the probability a woman will be advanced and hired. Although some of our estimates have large standard errors and there is one persistent effect in the opposite direction, the weight of the evidence suggests that the blind audition procedure fostered impartiality in hiring and increased the proportion women in symphony orchestras.

"Conley T.G., Udry C.R.",2010,American Economic Review,"This paper investigates the role of social learning in the diffusion of a new agricultural technology in Ghana. We use unique data on farmers' communication patterns to define each individual's information neighborhood. Conditional on many potentially confounding variables, we find evidence that farmers adjust their inputs to align with those of their information neighbors who were surprisingly successful in previous periods. The relationship of these input adjustments to experience further indicates the presence of social learning. In addition, applying the same method to input choices for another crop, of known technology, correctly indicates an absence of social learning effects."
Galí J.,1999,American Economic Review,"I estimate a decomposition of productivity and hours into technology and non-technology components. Two results stand out: (a) the estimated conditional correlations of hours and productivity are negative for technology shocks, positive for nontechnology shocks; (b) hours show a persistent decline in response to a positive technology shock. Most of the results hold for a variety of model specifications, and for the majority of G7 countries. The picture that emerges is hard to reconcile with a conventional real-business-cycle interpretation of business cycles, but is shown to be consistent with a simple model with monopolistic competition and sticky prices."
"Amiti M., Konings J.",2007,American Economic Review,"This paper estimates the productivity gains from reducing tariffs on final goods and from reducing tariffs on intermediate inputs. Lower output tariffs can increase productivity by inducing tougher import competition, whereas cheaper imported inputs can raise productivity via learning, variety, and quality effects. We use Indonesian manufacturing census data from 1991 to 2001, which include plant-level information on imported inputs. The results show that a 10 percentage point fall in input tariffs leads to a productivity gain of 12 percent for firms that import their inputs, at least twice as high as any gains from reducing output tariffs."
"Daron A., Simon J., Robinson J.A., Pierre Y.",2008,American Economic Review,Existing studies establish a strong cross-country correlation between income and democracy but do not control for factors that simultaneously affect both variables. We show that controlling for such factors by including country fixed effects removes the statistical association between income per capita and various measures of democracy. We present instrumental-variables estimates that also show no causal effect of income on democracy. The cross-country correlation between income and democracy reflects a positive correlation between changes in income and democracy over the past 500 years. This pattern is consistent with the idea that societies embarked on divergent political-economic development paths at certain critical junctures.
"Sims C.A., Zha T.",2006,American Economic Review,"A multivariate regime-switching model for monetary policy is confronted with U.S. data. The best fit allows time variation in disturbance variances only. With coefficients allowed to change, the best fit is with change only in the monetary policy rule and there are three estimated regimes corresponding roughly to periods when most observers believe that monetary policy actually differed. But the differences among regimes are not large enough to account for the rise, then decline, in inflation of the 1970s and 1980s. Our estimates imply monetary targeting was central in the early 1980s, but also important sporadically in the 1970s."
"Jensen R., Thursby M.",2001,American Economic Review,"Proponents of the Bayh-Dole Act argue that industrial use of federally funded research would be reduced without university patent licensing. Our survey of U.S. universities supports this view, emphasizing the embryonic state of most technologies licensed and the need for inventor cooperation in commercialization. Thus, for most university inventions, there is a moral-hazard problem with inventor effort. For such inventions, development does not occur unless the inventor's income is tied to the licensee's output by payments such as royalties or equity. Sponsored research from the licensee cannot by itself solve this problem."
"Acemoglu D., Robinson J.A.",2001,American Economic Review,"We develop a theory of political transitions inspired by the experiences of Western Europe and Latin America. Nondemocratic societies are controlled by a rich elite. The initially disenfranchised poor can contest power by threatening revolution, especially when the opportunity cost is low, for example, during recessions. The threat of revolution may force the elite to democratize. Democracy may not consolidate because it is redistributive, and so gives the elite an incentive to mount a coup. Highly unequal societies are less likely to consolidate democracy, and may end up oscillating between regimes and suffer substantial fiscal volatility."
"Greenwood J., Hercowitz Z., Krusell P.",1997,American Economic Review,The role that investment-specific technological change played in generating post-war U.S. growth is investigated here. The premise is that the introduction of new more efficient capital goods is an important source of productivity change and an attempt is made to disentangle its effects from the more traditional Hicks-neutral form of technological progress. The balanced growth path for the model is characterized and calibrated to U.S. National Income and Product Account (NIPA) data. The quantitative analysis suggests that investment-specific technological change accounts for the major part of growth.
"Benartzi S., Thaler R.H.",2001,American Economic Review,"There is a worldwide trend toward defined contribution saving plans and growing interest in privatized Social Security plans. In both environments, individuals are given some responsibility to make their own asset-allocation decisions, raising concerns about how well they do at this task. This paper investigates one aspect of the task, namely diversification. We show that some investors follow the ""1\n strategy"": they divide their contributions evenly across the funds offered in the plan. Consistent with this naive notion of diversification, we find that the proportion invested in stocks depends strongly on the proportion of stock funds in the plan."
Obstfeld M.,1994,American Economic Review,"This paper develops a continuous-time stochastic model in which international risk-sharing can yield substantial welfare gains through its effect on expected consumption growth. The mechanism linking global diversification to growth is an attendant world portfolio shift from safe low-yield capital to riskier high-yield capital. The presence of these two types of capital captures the idea that growth depends on the availability of an ever-increasing array of specialized, hence inherently risky, production inputs. Calibration exercises using consumption and stock-market data imply that most countries reap large steady-state welfare gains from global financial integration. -Author"
"Henderson J.V., Storeygard A., Weil D.N.",2012,American Economic Review,"We develop a statistical framework to use satellite data on night lights to augment official income growth measures.

Our estimates differ from official data by up to three percentage points annually. Using lights, empirical analyses of growth need no longer use countries as the unit of analysis; we can measure growth for sub- and supranational regions. We show, for example, that coastal areas in sub-Saharan Africa are growing slower than the hinterland."

This analysis allows us to separate legislated changes into those taken for reasons related to prospective economic conditions and those taken for more exogenous reasons. The behavior of output following these more exogenous changes indicates that tax increases are highly contractionary. The effects are strongly significant, highly robust, and much larger than those obtained using broader measures of tax changes. (JEL E32, E62, H20, N12)."
"Tornell A., Lane P.R.",1999,American Economic Review,"We analyze an economy that lacks a strong legal-political institutional infrastructure and is populated by multiple powerful groups.

In equilibrium, this leads to slow economic growth and a ""voracity effect,"" by which a shock, such as a terms of trade windfall, perversely generates a more-than-proportionate increase in fiscal redistribution and reduces growth. We also show that a dilution in the concentration of power leads to faster growth and a less procyclical response to shocks."
Popp D.,2002,American Economic Review,"I use U.S. patent data from 1970 to 1994 to estimate the effect of energy prices on energy-efficient innovations.

I find that both energy prices and the quality of existing knowledge have strongly significant positive effects on innovation. Furthermore, I show that omitting the quality of knowledge adversely affects the estimation results."
"Galor O., Weil D.N.",1996,American Economic Review,"This paper examines a novel mechanism linking fertility and growth. There are three components to the model: first, increases in capital per worker raise women's relative wages, since capital is more complementary to women's labor input than to men's. Second, increasing women's relative wages reduces fertility by raising the cost of children more than household income. And third, lower fertility raises the level of capital per worker. This positive feedback loop generates a demographic transition: a rapid decline infertility accompanied by accelerated output growth."

In particular, we find that announcement surprises produce conditional mean jumps; hence high-frequency exchange-rate dynamics are linked to fundamentals. The details of the linkage are intriguing and include announcement timing and sign effects. The sign effect refers to the fact that the market reacts to news in an asymmetric fashion: bad news has greater impact than good news, which we relate to recent theoretical work on information processing and price discovery."
"Basu K., Van P.H.",1998,American Economic Review,"If child labor as a mass phenomenon occurs not because of parental selfishness but because of the parents' concern for the household's survival, the popular argument for banning child labor loses much of its force. However, this assumption about parental decision-making coupled with the assumption of substitutability in production between child and adult labor could result in multiple equilibria in the labor market, with one equilibrium where children work and another where adult wage is high and children do not work.

This implies estimates of economic returns to education ranging from 6.8 to 10.6 percent."

We also provide out-of-sample forecasts of a countercyclical, forwardlooking measure of systemic risk, and show that the 2006:IV value of this measure would have predicted more than one-third of realized Δ CoVaR during the 2007-2009 financial crisis."

In contrast to multiple equilibrium models, our model allows analysis of policy proposals directed at curtailing currency attacks."

Jordà Ò.,2005,American Economic Review,"This paper introduces methods to compute impulse responses without specification and estimation of the underlying multivariate dynamic system. The central idea consists in estimating local projections at each period of interest rather than extrapolating into increasingly distant horizons from a given model, as it is done with vector autoregressions (VAR). The advantages of local projections are numerous: (1) they can be estimated by simple regression techniques with standard regression packages; (2) they are more robust to misspecification; (3) joint or point-wise analytic inference is simple; and (4) they easily accommodate experimentation with highly nonlinear and flexible specifications that may be impractical in a multivariate context. Therefore, these methods are a natural alternative to estimating impulse responses from VARs. Monte Carlo evidence and an application to a simple, closed-economy, new-Keynesian model clarify these numerous advantages."
Keller W.,2002,American Economic Review,"Income convergence across countries turns on whether technological knowledge spillovers are global or local. I estimate the amount of spillovers from R&D expenditures on a geographic basis, using a new data set which encompasses most of the world's innovative activity between 1970 and 1995. I find that technology is to a substantial degree local, not global, as the benefits from spillovers are declining with distance. The distance at which the amount of spillovers is halved is about 1,200 kilometers. I also find that over time, technological knowledge has become considerably more global. Moreover, language skills are important for spillover diffusion."

In the early 19th century most inequality was due to differences within countries; later, it was due to differences between countries. Inequality in longevity, also increased during the 19th century, but then was reversed in the second half of the 20th century, perhaps mitigating the failure of income inequality to improve in the last decades.

"Imbs J., Wacziarg R.",2003,American Economic Review,"This paper studies the evolution of sectoral concentration in relation to the level of per capita income. We show that various measures of sectoral concentration follow a U-shaped pattern across a wide variety of data sources: countries first diversify, in the sense that economic activity is spread more equally across sectors, but there exists, relatively late in the development process, a point at which they start specializing again. We discuss this finding in light of existing theories of trade and growth, which generally predict a monotonic relationship between income and diversification."
Weitzman M.L.,2001,American Economic Review,"By incorporating the probability distribution directly into the analysis, this paper proposes a new theoretical approach to resolving the perennial dilemma of being uncertain about what discount rate to use in cost-benefit analysis. A numerical example is constructed from the results of a survey based on the opinions of 2,160 economists. The main finding is that even if every individual believes in a constant discount rate, the wide spread of opinion on what it should be makes the effective social discount rate decline significantly over time. Implications and ramifications of this proposed ""gamma-discounting"" approach are discussed."
"Engel C., Rogers J.H.",1996,American Economic Review,We use CPI data for U.S. and Canadian cities for 14 categories of consumer prices to examine the nature of the deviations from the law of one price. The distance between cities explains a significant amount of the variation in the prices of similar goods in different cities. But the variation of the price is much higher for two cities located in different countries than for two equidistant cities in the same country. We explore some of the reasons for this finding. Sticky nominal prices appear to be one explanation but probably do not explain most of the border effect.

We find that a single factor, a single tent-shaped linear combination of forward rates, predicts excess returns on one- to five-year maturity bonds with R 2 up to 0.44. The return-forecasting factor is countercyclical and forecasts stock returns. An important component of the return-forecasting factor is unrelated to the level, slope, and curvature movements described by most term structure models. We document that measurement errors do not affect our central results."
"Angrist J.D., Evans W.N.",1998,American Economic Review,Research on the labor-supply consequences of childbearing is complicated by the endogeneity of fertility. This study uses parental preferences for a mixed sibling-sex composition to construct instrumental variables (IV) estimates of the effect of childbearing on labor supply. IV estimates for women are significant but smaller than ordinary least-squares estimates. The IV are also smaller for more educated women and show no impact of family size on husbands' labor supply. A comparison of estimates using sibling-sex composition and twins instruments implies that the impact of a third child disappears when the child reaches age 13.
"Deschênes O., Greenstone M.",2007,American Economic Review,"This paper measures the economic impact of climate change on US agricultural land by estimating the effect of random year-to-year variation in temperature and precipitation on agricultural profits. The preferred estimates indicate that climate change will increase annual profits by $1.3 billion in 2002 dollars (2002$) or 4 percent. This estimate is robust to numerous specification checks and relatively precise, so large negative or positive effects are unlikely. We also find the hedonic approach-which is the standard in the previous literature - to be unreliable because it produces estimates that are extremely sensitive to seemingly minor choices about control variables, sample, and weighting."
Bustos P.,2011,American Economic Review,"This paper studies the impact of a regional free trade agreement, MERCOSUR, on technology upgrading by Argentinean firms. To guide empirical work, I introduce technology choice in a model of trade with heterogeneous firms. The joint treatment of the technology and exporting choices shows that the increase in revenues produced by trade integration can induce exporters to upgrade technology. An empirical test of the model reveals that firms in industries facing higher reductions in Brazil's tariffs increase investment in technology faster.

Levitt S.D.,1997,American Economic Review,"Previous empirical studies have uncovered little evidence that police reduce crime, possibly due to simultaneity problems. This paper uses the timing of mayoral and gubernatorial elections as an instrumental variable to identify a causal effect of police on crime. Increases in the size of police forces are shown to be disproportionately concentrated in mayoral and gubernatorial election years. Increases in police are shown to substantially reduce violent crime, but have a smaller impact on property crime. The null hypothesis that the marginal social benefit of reduced crime equals the costs of hiring additional police cannot be rejected."
"Chen J., Hong H., Huang M., Kubik J.D.",2004,American Economic Review,"We investigate the effect of scale on performance in the active money management industry. We first document that fund returns, both before and after fees and expenses, decline with lagged fund size, even after accounting for various performance benchmarks. We then explore a number of potential explanations for this relationship. This association is most pronounced among funds that have to invest in small and illiquid stocks, suggesting that these adverse scale effects are related to liquidity. Controlling for its size, a fund's return does not deteriorate with the size of the family that it belongs to, indicating that scale need not be bad for performance depending on how the fund is organized. Finally, using data on whether funds are solo-managed or team-managed and the composition of fund investments, we explore the idea that scale erodes fund performance because of the interaction of liquidity and organizational diseconomies."
Rodríguez-Clare A.,1996,American Economic Review,"This paper explores how multinationals affect underdeveloped regions through the generation of linkages. It is shown that the linkage effect of multinationals on the host country is more likely to be favorable when the good that multinationals produce uses intermediate goods intensively, when there are large costs of communication between the headquarters and the production plant, and when the home and host countries are not too different in terms of the variety of intermediate goods produced. If these conditions are reversed, then multinationals could even hurt the developing economy, formalizing the idea that multinationals may create enclave economies within developing countries."

Overall, the evidence indicates that nepotism hurts performance by limiting the scope of labor market competition."

Moving as an adolescent has slightly negative impacts, perhaps because of disruption effects. The decline in the gains from moving with the age when children move suggests that the duration of exposure to better environments during childhood is an important determinant of children's long-term outcomes.

In the one-period model that has formed the basis for much of the literature on discretionary monetary policy, it is shown that the optimal contract ties the rewards of the central banker to realized inflation.

Hall R.E.,2005,American Economic Review,"Following a recession, the aggregate labor market is slack-employment remains below normal and recruiting efforts of employers, as measured by help-wanted advertising and vacancies, are low. A model of matching friction explains the qualitative responses of the labor market to adverse shocks, but requires implausibly large shocks to account for the magnitude of observed fluctuations. The incorporation of wage stickiness vastly increases the sensitivity of the model to driving forces. I develop a new model of the way that wage stickiness affects unemployment. The stickiness arises in an economic equilibrium and satisfies the condition that no worker-employer pair has an unexploited opportunity for mutual improvement. Sticky wages neither interfere with the efficient formation of employment matches nor cause inefficient job loss. Thus the model provides an answer to the fundamental criticism previously directed at sticky-wage models of fluctuations."

The evidence indicates that residential segregation and the external effect of ethnicity are linked partly because ethnic capital summarizes the socioeconomic background of the neighborhood where the children were raised. Ethnicity has an external effect, even among persons who grow up in the same neighborhood, when children are exposed frequently to persons who share the same ethnic background. -Author"
"Besley T., Ghatak M.",2005,American Economic Review,"A unifying theme in the literature on organizations such as public bureaucracies and private nonprofits is the importance of mission, as opposed to profit, as an organizational goal. Such mission-oriented organizations are frequently staffed by motivated agents who subscribe to the mission. This paper studies incentives in such contexts and emphasizes the role of matching the mission preferences of principals and agents in increasing organizational efficiency. Matching economizes on the need for high-powered incentives. It can also, however, entrench bureaucratic conservatism and resistance to innovations. The framework developed in this paper is applied to school competition, incentives in the public sector and in private nonprofits, and the interdependence of incentives and productivity between the private for-profit sector and the mission-oriented sector through occupational choice."

Second, banking crises (domestic and those in financial centers) often precede or accompany sovereign debt crises; we find they help predict them. Third, public borrowing surges ahead of external sovereign default, as governments have ""hidden domestic debts"" that exceed the better documented levels of external debt."

In that case, ""budget"" brands are priced at marginal cost, while ""luxury"" brands, though not intrinsically superior, are sold at higher prices to consumers seeking to advertise wealth. Luxury brands earn strictly positive profits under conditions that would, with standard formulations of preferences, yield marginal-cost pricing.

"Alesina A., Angeletos G.-M.",2005,American Economic Review,"Different beliefs about the fairness of social competition and what determines income inequality influence the redistributive policy chosen in a society. But the composition of income in equilibrium depends on tax policies. We show how the interaction between social beliefs and welfare policies may lead to multiple equilibria or multiple steady states. If a society believes that individual effort determines income, and that all have a right to enjoy the fruits of their effort, it will choose low redistribution and low taxes. In equilibrium, effort will be high and the role of luck will be limited, in which case market outcomes will be relatively fair and social beliefs will be self-fulfilled. If, instead, a society believes that luck, birth, connections, and/or corruption determine wealth, it will levy high taxes, thus distorting allocations and making these beliefs self-sustained as well. These insights may help explain the cross-country variation in perceptions about income inequality and choices of redistributive policies."

Gruber J.,1994,The American economic review,"I consider the labor-market effects of mandates which raise the costs of employing a demographically identifiable group. The efficiency of these policies will be largely dependent on the extent to which their costs are shifted to group-specific wages. I study several state and federal mandates which stipulated that childbirth be covered comprehensively in health insurance plans, raising the relative cost of insuring women of childbearing age. I find substantial shifting of the costs of these mandates to the wages of the targeted group. Correspondingly, I find little effect on total labor input for that group."
Hoxby C.M.,2000,American Economic Review,Tiebout choice among districts is the most powerful market force in American public education. Naive estimates of its effects are biased by endogenous district formation. I derive instruments from the natural boundaries in a metropolitan area. My results suggest that metropolitan areas with greater Tiebout choice have more productive public schools and less private schooling. Little of the effect of Tiebout choice works through its effect on household sorting. This finding may be explained by another finding: students are equally segregated by school in metropolitan areas with greater and lesser degrees of Tiebout choice among districts.

We show that, on the topics where readers share common beliefs, one should not expect accuracy even from competitive media: competition results in lower prices, but common slanting toward reader biases. On topics where reader beliefs diverge (such as politically divisive issues), however, newspapers segment the market and slant toward extreme positions. Yet in the aggregate, a reader with access to all news sources could get an unbiased perspective. Generally speaking, reader heterogeneity is more important for accuracy in media than competition per se."

From this perspective, we argue that preferential agreements undermine GATT's ability to deliver efficient multilateral outcomes."

Goldin C.,2014,American Economic Review,"The converging roles of men and women are among the grandest advances in society and the economy in the last century. These aspects of the grand gender convergence are figurative chapters in a history of gender roles. But what must the ""last"" chapter contain for there to be equality in the labor market? The answer may come as a surprise. The solution does not (necessarily) have to involve government intervention and it need not make men more responsible in the home (although that wouldn't hurt). But it must involve changes in the labor market, especially how jobs are structured and remunerated to enhance temporal flexibility. The gender gap in pay would be considerably reduced and might vanish altogether if firms did not have an incentive to disproportionately reward individuals who labored long hours and worked particular hours. Such change has taken off in various sectors, such as technology, science, and health, but is less apparent in the corporate, financial, and legal worlds."
"DellaVigna S., Malmendier U.",2006,American Economic Review,"How do consumers choose from a menu of contracts? We analyze a novel dataset from three U.S. health clubs with information on both the contractual choice and the day-to-day attendance decisions of 7,752 members over three years. The observed consumer behavior is difficult to reconcile with standard preferences and beliefs. First, members who choose a contract with a flat monthly fee of over $70 attend on average 4.3 times per month. They pay a price per expected visit of more than $17, even though they could pay $10 per visit using a 10-visit pass. On average, these users forgo savings of $600 during their membership. Second, consumers who choose a monthly contract are 17 percent more likely to stay enrolled beyond one year than users committing for a year. This is surprising because monthly members pay higher fees for the option to cancel each month. We also document cancellation delays and attendance expectations, among other findings. Leading explanations for our findings are overconfidence about future self-control or about future efficiency. Overconfident agents overestimate attendance as well as the cancellation probability of automatically renewed contracts. Our results suggest that making inferences from observed contract choice under the rational expectation hypothesis can lead to biases in the estimation of consumer preferences."

With imperfect credit and insurance markets some redistributive policies can improve ex ante welfare, and this implies that their political support tends to decrease with inequality. Conversely, with credit constraints, lower redistribution translates into more persistent inequality; hence the potential for multiple steady states, with mutually reinforcing high inequality and low redistribution, or vice versa."

Worker effort is positively related to the productivity of workers who see him, but not workers who do not see him.

Our results thus highlight that the same factors that contribute to resilience under certain conditions may function as significant sources of systemic risk under others."

With hidden information, it may be optimal for an agent to supply the same inefficient effort regardless of cost conditions. With moral hazard, optimal contracts involve just two levels of compensation. This is true even if performance measures are subjective, in which case optimal contracts terminate following poor performance."

The paper then embeds the habit-consumption specification in a monetary-policy model and finds that the responses of both spending and inflation to monetary-policy actions are significantly improved by this modification."

In this view the environment is seen not as a factor that limits productivity as population expands, but as a good whose quality is degraded by a growing population. While there is no question that population growth contributes to environmental degradation, its effects can be modified by economic growth and modern technology. An important question for policy is whether, holding constant per capital income and other relevant factors, population pressures have a significant effect on environmental degradation. This paper takes a first step toward providing such evidence. Specifically, it examines the effect of population pressures on deforestation in 64 developing countries. -from Authors"
Andolfatto D.,1996,American Economic Review,"The quantitative implications of labor-market search for economic fluctuations are evaluated in the context of a real-business-cycle model.

In addition, the model replicates the observation that output growth displays positive autocorrelation at short horizons. Overall, the empirical results suggest that the labor-market-search environment embodies a quantitatively important propagation mechanism."

"Campbell J.Y., Vuolteenaho T.",2004,American Economic Review,"This paper explains the size and value ""anomalies"" in stock returns using an economically motivated two-beta model We break the beta of a stock with the market portfolio into two components, one reflecting news about the market's future cash flows and one reflecting news about the market's discount rates. Intertemporal asset pricing theory suggests that the former should have a higher price of risk; thus beta, like cholesterol, comes in ""bad"" and ""good"" varieties. Empirically, we find that value stocks and small stocks have considerably higher cash-flow betas than growth stocks and large stocks, and this can explain their higher average returns. The poor performance of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) since 1963 is explained by the fact that growth stocks and high-past-beta stocks have predominantly good betas with low risk prices."

"Fudenberg D., Levine D.K.",2006,American Economic Review,"We propose that a simple ""dual-self"" model gives a unified explanation for several empirical regularities, including the apparent time inconsistency that has motivated models of quasi-hyperbolic discounting and Rabin's paradox of risk aversion in the large and small. The model also implies that self-control costs imply excess delay, as in the O'Donoghue and Rabin models of quasi-hyperbolic utility, and it explains experimental evidence that increased cognitive load makes temptations harder to resist. The base version of our model is consistent with the Gul-Pesendorfer axioms, but we argue that these axioms must be relaxed to account for the effect of cognitive load."

We construct posterior weights for the determinacy and indeterminacy region of the parameter space and estimates for the propagation of fundamental and sunspot shocks. According to the estimated model, U.S. monetary policy post-1982 is consistent with determinacy, whereas the pre-Volcker policy is not. We find that before 1979 indeterminacy substantially altered the propagation of shocks."
"Plott C.R., Zeiler K.",2005,American Economic Review,"We conduct experiments to explore the possibility that subject misconceptions, as opposed to a particular theory of preferences referred to as the ""endowment effect,"" account for reported gaps between willingness to pay (""WTP"") and willingness to accept ( ""WTA""). The literature reveals two important facts. First, there is no consensus regarding the nature or robustness of WTP-WTA gaps. Second, while experimenters are careful to control for subject misconceptions, there is no consensus about the fundamental properties of misconceptions or how to avoid them. Instead, by implementing different types of experimental controls, experimenters have revealed notions of how misconceptions arise. Experimenters have applied these controls separately or in different combinations. Such controls include ensuring subject anonymity, using incentive-compatible elicitation mechanisms, and providing subjects with practice and training on the elicitation mechanism before employing it to measure valuations. The pattern of results reported in the literature suggests that the widely differing reports of WTP-WTA gaps could be due to an incomplete science regarding subject misconceptions. We implement a ""revealed theory"" methodology to compensate for the lack of a theory of misconceptions. Theories implicit in experimental procedures found in the literature are at the heart of our experimental design. Thus, our approach to addressing subject misconceptions reflects an attempt to control simultaneously for all dimensions of concern over possible subject misconceptions found in the literature. To this end, our procedures modify the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism used in previous studies to elicit values. In addition, our procedures supplement commonly used procedures by providing extensive training on the elicitation mechanism before subjects provide WTP and WTA responses. Experiments were conducted using both lotteries and mugs, goods frequently used in endowment effect experiments. Using the modified procedures, we observe no gap between WTA and WTP. Therefore, our results call into question the interpretation of observed gaps as evidence of loss aversion or prospect theory. Further evidence is required before convincing interpretations of observed gaps can be advanced."

These areas also have significantly lower investments in health and education. These differences are not driven by omitted variables or endogeneity problems; they probably arise because differences in historical institutions lead to very different policy choices."

For industries that experienced the largest U.S. tariff cuts, plant-level labor productivity soared by 14 percent.

Agents interact through local public goods or externalities (school funding, neighborhood effects) and economy-wide linkages (complementary skills, knowledge spillovers). Sorting families into homogeneous communities often minimizes the costs of existing heterogeneity, but mixing reduces heterogeneity faster. Integration therefore tends to slow down growth in the short run yet raise it in the long run. A move to state funding of education presents society with a similar intertemporal trade-off.

These findings may explain why long-term interest rates typically rise in response to shifts to tighter monetary policy.

This provides a simple justification for the coexistence of proportionate growth and the resulting lognormal distribution.

This strategy allows to identify the sizeable causal impact of inherited trust on worldwide growth during the twentieth century by controlling for country fixed effects.
Fernald J.G.,1999,American Economic Review,"Does the positive correlation between infrastructure and productivity reflect causation? If so, in which direction? I find that when growth in roads (the largest component of infrastructure) changes, productivity growth changes disproportionately in U.S. industries with more vehicles. That vehicle-intensive industries benefit more from road-building suggests that roads are productive. At the margin, however, road investments do not appear unusually productive. Intuitively, the interstate system was highly productive, but a second one would not be. Road-building thus explains much of the productivity slowdown through a one-time, unrepeatable productivity boost in the 1950's and 1960's."

Estimates of price-cost markups are derived using direct measures of marginal cost and several approaches that do not rely on cost data.

All estimates indicate that prices, while higher than marginal costs, are not nearly as high as most theoretical models predict. Regulatory constraints, the threat of entry, and financial contracts between the suppliers and their customers are considered as possible explanations for the observed price levels."

"Koszegi B., Rabin M.",2007,American Economic Review,"We use Koszegi and Rabin's (2006) model of reference-dependent utility, and an extension of it that applies to decisions with delayed consequences, to study preferences over monetary risk. Because our theory equates the reference point with recent probabilistic beliefs about outcomes, it predicts specific ways in which the environment influences attitudes toward modest-scale risk. It replicates ""classical"" prospect theory - including the prediction of distaste for insuring losses - when exposure to risk is a surprise, but implies first-order risk aversion when a risk, and the possibility of insuring it, are anticipated. A prior expectation to take on risk decreases aversion to both the anticipated and additional risk. For large-scale risk, the model allows for standard ""consumption utility"" to dominate reference-dependent ""gain-loss utility, "" generating nearly identical risk aversion across situations."

A policy of capital structure coordinated with dividends follows naturally, as do implications for the level, frequency, and maturity structure of debt as a function of outside investment opportunities. Additionally, the model yields new testable implications for security design, and changes in debt and empire-building over managerial careers."
"Bernard A.B., Jones C.I.",1996,American Economic Review,"This paper examines the role of sectors in aggregate convergence for 14 OECD countries during 1970-1987. The major finding is that manufacturing shows little evidence of either labor productivity or multifactor productivity convergence, while other sectors, especially services, are driving the aggregate convergence result. To determine the robustness of the convergence results, the paper introduces a new measure of multifactor productivity which avoids many problems inherent to traditional measures of total factor productivity when comparing productivity levels. The lack of convergence in manufacturing is robust to the method of calculating multifactor productivity."
"Avery C., Zemsky P.",1998,American Economic Review,"We study the relationship between asset prices and herd behavior, which occurs when traders follow the trend in past trades. When traders have private information on only a single dimension of uncertainty (the effect of a shock to the asset value), price adjustments prevent herd behavior. Herding arises when there are two dimensions of uncertainty (the existence and effect of a shock), but it need not distort prices because the market discounts the informativeness of trades during herding. With a third dimension of uncertainty (the quality of traders' information), herd behavior can lead to a significant, short-run mispricing."
"Goldberg P.K., Maggi G.",1999,American Economic Review,"The Grossman-Helpman Protection for Sale"" model, concerning the political economy of trade protection, yields clear predictions for the cross-sectional structure of import barriers. Our objective is to check whether the predictions of the Grossman-Helpman model are consistent with the data and, if the model finds support, to estimate its key structural parameters. We find that the pattern of protection in the United States in 1983 is broadly consistent with the predictions of the model. A surprising finding is that the weight of welfare in the government's objective function is many times larger than the weight of contributions. (JEL F1)."

Attempts an unambiguous definition of productivity growth and demonstrates how its measurement can be approached from either the primal or the dual characterization of the production structure. Applies this methodology to obtain estimates of productivity growth for Class I US railroads in the period 1955-74. The estimates of the variable cost model show that returns to scale are sizeable for US railroads if output changes are accompanied by changes in haul and trip lengths.

"Lizzeri A., Persico N.",2001,American Economic Review,Politicians who care about the spoils of office may underprovide a public good because its benefits cannot be targeted to voters as easily as pork-barrel spending. We compare a winner-take-all system - where all the spoils go to the winner - to a proportional system - where the spoils of office are split among candidates proportionally to their share of the vote. In a winner-take-all system the public good is provided less often than in a proportional system when the public good is particularly desirable. We then consider the electoral college system and show that it is particularly subject to this inefficiency.
"Carroll C.D., Overland J., Weil D.N.",2000,American Economic Review,"Saving and growth are strongly positively correlated across countries. Recent empirical evidence suggests that this correlation holds largely because high growth leads to high saving, not the other way around. This evidence is difficult to reconcile with standard growth models, since forward-looking consumers with standard utility should save less in a fast-growing economy because they know they will be richer in the future than they are today. We show that if utility depends partly on how consumption compares to a ""habit stock"" determined by past consumption, an otherwise-standard growth model can imply that increases in growth can cause increased saving."

Items are awarded at the current price whenever they are ""clinched,"" and the price is incremented until the market clears. With private values, this (dynamic) auction yields the same outcome as the (sealed-bid) Vickrey auction, but has advantages of simplicity and privacy preservation. With interdependent values, this auction may retain efficiency, whereas the Vickrey auction suffers from a generalized Winner's Curse."
"Duranton G., Turner M.A.",2011,American Economic Review,"We investigate the effect of lane kilometers of roads on vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT) in US cities. VKT increases proportionately to roadway lane kilometers for interstate highways and probably slightly less rapidly for other types of roads. The sources for this extra VKT are increases in driving by current residents, increases in commercial traffic, and migration. Increasing lane kilometers for one type of road diverts little traffic from other types of road. We find no evidence that the provision of public transportation affects VKT. We conclude that increased provision of roads or public transit is unlikely to relieve congestion."
Lohmann S.,1992,American Economic Review,"The classic time-consistency problem in monetary policy arises from a policymaker's futile attempt to stimulate output above the natural level, resulting in an inflationary bias to discretionary monetary policy (Finn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott, 1977; Robert J. Barro and David B. Gordon, 1983). The policymaker can eliminate the inflationary bias by credibly committing to a zero-inflation policy rule. Yet she would like to retain the flexibility to employ monetary instruments to stabilize employment and output. As a result, the ex ante optimal policy rule is contingent on the state of the world."

"Jackson M.O., Rogers B.W.",2007,American Economic Review,"We present a dynamic model of network formation where nodes find other nodes with whom to form links in two ways: some are found uniformly at random, while others are found by searching locally through the current structure of the network (e.g., meeting friends of friends). This combination of meeting processes results in a spectrum of features exhibited by large social networks, including the presence of more high- and low-degree nodes than when links are formed independently at random, having low distances between nodes in the network, and having high clustering of links on a local level. We fit the model to data from six networks and impute the relative ratio of random to network-based meetings in link formation, which turns out to vary dramatically across applications. We show that as the random/network-based meeting ratio varies, the resulting degree distributions can be ordered in the sense of stochastic dominance, which allows us to infer how the formation process affects average utility in the network."
"Haider S., Solon G.",2006,American Economic Review,"All of our analyses tell the same story: contrary to the textbook errors-in-variables model usually assumed in applied research, the slope coefficient in the regression of log current earnings on log annual earnings varies systematically over the life cycle and is not generally equal to one. We can illustrate the usefulness of our results by applying them to the intergenerational mobility regression in which sons' log of lifetime earnings is the dependent variable and fathers' log of lifetime earnings is the explanatory variable. As summarized in Solon (1999), most recent research in that literature has devoted considerable attention to the right-side measurement error from using short-run proxies for fathers' lifetime earnings. Our estimates of 0, shown in Figures 2 and 3 confirm the literature's presumption that right-side measurement error causes an attenuation inconsistency in OLS estimation of the intergenerational elasticity.12 The literature, however, has given much less attention to the left-side measurement error from using short-run proxies for sons' lifetime earnings. Presumably, this neglect reflects an assumption by researchers that, in accordance with the textbook errors-in-variables model, left-side measurement error is innocuous for consistency. All our estimates of λt suggest that assumption would be fairly well founded if sons' earnings were measured between the early thirties and mid-forties. Many intergenerational mobility studies, however, have measured sons' earnings at earlier ages, and this has substantially affected the findings. Reville (1995), for example, estimates intergenerational elasticities of about 0.25 when he measures the sons' earnings in their twenties, but his estimates start approaching 0.5 when he observes the sons well into their thirties. This is just the pattern one should expect from the trajectories of λt, in Figures 2 and 3. An important implication is that many estimates of the intergenerational earnings elasticity have been subject to substantial attenuation inconsistency from left-side measurement error, in addition to the well-known inconsistency from right-side measurement error. Of course, interpreting evidence on intergenerational earnings mobility is just one example of how our results might be applied. We advise readers, however, to exercise due caution in importing our estimates of λt, and θt, to other earnings data. We already have mentioned issues of comparability between administrative and survey data. Furthermore, the life-cycle trajectories for our U.S. cohort born 1931-1933 may differ from those for other cohorts and other countries. In addition, as emphasized in Solon (1992), sample selection criteria that affect the sample's dispersion in earnings also affect the measurement error properties of current earnings as proxies for lifetime earnings. Nevertheless, taking account of our evidence on departures from the textbook errors-in-variables model should enable better-informed analyses of estimation biases in a wide variety of research that uses current earnings variables as proxies for long-run earnings."
"Sethi R., Somanathan E.",1996,American Economic Review,"The problem of extracting commonly owned renewable resources is examined within an evolutionary-game-theoretic framework. It is shown that cooperative behavior guided by norms of restraint and punishment may be stable in a well-defined sense against invasion by narrowly self-interested behavior. The resource-stock dynamics are integrated with the evolutionary-game dynamics. Effects of changes in prices, technology, and social cohesion on extraction behavior and the long-run stock are analyzed. When threshold values of the parameters are crossed, social norms can break down leading generally to the lowering of the long-run stock, and possibly to its extinction."

As corruption often undermines the purpose of the intervention, governments will try to prevent it.

Since preventing all corruption is excessively costly, second-best intervention may involve a certain fraction of bureaucrats accepting bribes. When corruption is harder to prevent, there may be both more bureaucrats and higher public-sector wages. Also, the optimal degree of government intervention may be nonmonotonic in the level of income."
Oreopoulos P.,2006,American Economic Review,"The change to the minimum school-leaving age in the United Kingdom from 14 to 15 had a powerful and immediate effect that redirected almost half the population of 14-year-olds in the mid-twentieth century to stay in school for one more year. The magnitude of this impact provides a rare opportunity to (a) estimate local average treatment effects (LATE) of high school that come close to population average treatment effects (ATE); and (b) estimate returns to education using a regression discontinuity design instead of previous estimates that rely on difference-in-differences methodology or relatively weak instruments. Comparing LATE estimates for the United States and Canada, where very few students were affected by compulsory school laws, to the United Kingdom estimates provides a test as to whether instrumental variables (IV) returns to schooling often exceed ordinary least squares (OLS) because gains are high only for small and peculiar groups among the more general population. I find, instead, that the benefits from compulsory schooling are very large whether these laws have an impact on a majority or minority of those exposed."
"Bernard A.B., Redding S.J., Schott P.K.",2010,American Economic Review,"This paper examines the frequency, pervasiveness, and determinants of product switching by US manufacturing firms.

The behavior we observe is consistent with a natural generalization of existing theories of industry dynamics that incorporates endogenous product selection within firms. Our findings suggest that product switching contributes to a reallocation of resources within firms toward their most efficient use."
"Becker G.S., Philipson T.J., Soares R.R.",2005,American Economic Review,"GDP per capita is usually used to proxy for the quality of life of individuals living in different countries. Welfare is also affected by quantity of life, however, as represented by longevity. This paper incorporates longevity into an overall assessment of the evolution of cross-country inequality and shows that it is quantitatively important. The absence of reduction in cross-country inequality up to the 1990s documented in previous work is in stark contrast to the reduction in inequality after incorporating gains in longevity. Throughout the post-World War U period, health contributed to reduce significantly welfare inequality across countries. This paper derives valuation formulas for infra-marginal changes in longevity and computes a ""full"" growth rate that incorporates the gains in health experienced by 96 countries for the period between 1960 and 2000. Incorporating longevity gains changes traditional results; countries starting with lower income tended to grow faster than countries starting with higher income. We estimate an average yearly growth in ""full income"" of 4.1 percent for the poorest 50 percent of countries in 1960, of which 1.7 percentage points are due to health, as opposed to a growth of 2.6 percent for the richest 50 percent of countries, of which only 0.4 percentage points are due to health. Additionally, we decompose changes in life expectancy into changes attributable to 13 broad groups of causes of death and three age groups. We show that mortality from infectious, respiratory, and digestive diseases, congenital, perinatal, and ""ill-defined"" conditions, mostly concentrated before age 20 and between ages 20 and 50, is responsible for most of the reduction in life expectancy inequality. At the same time, the recent effect of AIDS, together with reductions in mortality after age 50 - due to nervous system, senses organs, heart and circulatory diseases-contributed to increase health inequality across countries."
"Burkart M., Ellingsen T.",2004,American Economic Review,"It is typically less profitable for an opportunistic borrower to divert inputs than to divert cash. Therefore, suppliers may lend more liberally than banks. This simple argument is at the core of our contract theoretic model of trade credit in competitive markets. The model implies that trade credit and bank credit can be either complements or substitutes. Among other things, the model explains why trade credit has short maturity, why trade credit is more prevalent in less developed credit markets, and why accounts payable of large unrated firms are more countercyclical than those of small firms."

Chiswick B.R.,1999,American Economic Review,"This paper has explored the conceptual issues regarding the selectivity of migrants. The analysis indicates a tendency toward the favorable self-selection (supply) of migrants for labor-market success on the basis of a higher level of ability, broadly defined. The favorable selectivity is more intense the greater the out-of-pocket (direct) costs of migration and return migration, the greater the effect of ability on lowering the costs of migration, and the smaller the relative skill differentials in the lower-wage origin relative to the higher-wage destination. Favorable selectivity for labor-market success can be expected to be less intense for noneconomic migrants, such as refugees, tied movers, and ideological migrants, and for sojourners (short-term migrants) and illegal aliens. The analysis in this paper applies only to the supply of immigrants and not to observed outcomes. The determinants of the demand for immigrants are also relevant for international migration, as all nation states have selection criteria for whom they will admit. The overall favorable selectivity of immigrants therefore depends on the favorable selectivity of the supply of immigrants and the criteria used to ration admissions."
"Elliott M., Golub B., Jackson M.O.",2014,American Economic Review,"We study cascades of failures in a network of interdependent financial organizations: how discontinuous changes in asset values (e.g., defaults and shutdowns) trigger further failures, and how this depends on network structure. Integration (greater dependence on counterparties) and diversification (more counterparties per organization) have different, nonmonotonic effects on the extent of cascades. Diversification connects the network initially, permitting cascades to travel; but as it increases further, organizations are better insured against one another's failures. Integration also faces trade-offs: increased dependence on other organizations versus less sensitivity to own investments.

Mendoza E.G.,2010,American Economic Review,"Financial crashes were followed by deep recessions in the Sudden Stops of emerging economies. An equilibrium business cycle model with a collateral constraint explains this phenomenon as a result of the amplification and asymmetry that the constraint induces in the responses of macro-aggregates to shocks. Leverage rises during expansions, and when it rises enough it triggers the constraint, causing a Fisherian deflation that reduces credit and the price and quantity of collateral assets. Output and factor allocations fall because access to working capital financing is also reduced. Precautionary saving makes Sudden Stops low probability events nested within normal cycles, as observed in the data."

With a lag of several years, inputs and investment return to normal and output rises strongly. The standard one-sector real-business-cycle model is not consistent with this evidence. The evidence is consistent, however, with simple sticky-price models, which predict the results we find: when technology improves, inputs and investment generally fall in the short run, and output itself may also fall."

Consequently, an increase in inequality lowers average education and, therefore, growth. We find that this fertility-differential effect accounts for most of the empirical relationship between inequality and growth."

Nevertheless, constant growth can temporarily proceed at a faster rate, provided research intensity and educational attainment rise steadily over time.

Each type of model leaves a characteristic ""footprint"" on the shape of the adoption curve which provides a basis for discriminating empirically between them.

Ex post, the former are higher risk than insurance companies expect, while the latter are lower risk. In aggregate, those with more insurance are not higher risk. Our results demonstrate that insurance markets may suffer from asymmetric information even absent a positive correlation between insurance coverage and risk occurrence.

Kranton R.E.,1996,American Economic Review,"Reciprocal exchange, or gift exchange, remains a widespread means of obtaining goods and services. This paper examines the persistence of reciprocal exchange by formalizing the interaction between self-enforcing exchange agreements and monetary market exchange. When more people engage in reciprocal exchange, market search costs increase, reciprocity is easier to enforce and yields higher utility. Thus, personalized exchange can persist even when it is inefficient. Conversely, large markets can destroy reciprocity when reciprocal exchange is efficient. The results characterize the use of personal ""connections"" as a system of reciprocal exchange and explain the disappearance of reciprocity when tribes encounter markets."

The model can be readily calibrated so that variations in the distribution of distortions allow matching the observed cross-country moments. We show that the differences in the distortions that account for the size-productivity covariance imply substantial differences in aggregate performance.

"Dohmen T., Falk A.",2011,American Economic Review,"This paper studies the impact of incentives on worker self-s election in a controlled laboratory experiment. Subjects face the choice between a fixed and a variable payment scheme. Depending on the treatment, the variable payment is a piece rate, a tournament, or a revenue-sharing scheme. We find that output is higher in the variable-payment schemes compared to the fixed-payment scheme. This difference is largely driven by productivity sorting. In addition, different incentive schemes systematically attract individuals with different attitudes, such as willingness to take risks and relative self-assessment as well as gender, which underlines the importance of multidimensional sorting."

This paper studies utility-based biases in beliefs by supposing that beliefs maximize average felicity, optimally balancing this benefit of optimism against the costs of worse decision making. A small optimistic bias in beliefs typically leads to first-order gains in anticipatory utility and only second-order costs in realized outcomes. In a portfolio choice example, investors overestimate their return and exhibit a preference for skewness; in general equilibrium, investors' prior beliefs are endogenously heterogeneous. In a consumption-saving example, consumers are both overconfident and overoptimistic."

The experimental design represents an improvement over the existing literature by including sessions with finite repeated games as controls and a large number of players per session (which allows for learning without contagion effects). I find that the shadow of the future matters not only by significantly reducing opportunistic behavior, but also because its impact closely follows theoretical predictions."
"Head K., Ries J.",2001,American Economic Review,"We evaluate two alternative models of international trade in differentiated products. An increasing returns model where varieties are linked to firms predicts home market effects: increases in a country's share of demand cause disproportionate increases in its share of output. In contrast, a constant returns model with national product differentiation predicts a less than proportionate increase. We examine a panel of U.S. and Canadian manufacturing industries to test the models. Although we find support for either model, depending on whether we estimate based on within or between variation, the preponderance of the evidence supports national product differentiation."

In a real-effort experiment, we manipulate the rational expectations of subjects and check whether this manipulation influences their effort provision. We find that effort provision is significantly different between treatments in the way predicted by models of expectation-based, reference-dependent preferences: if expectations are high, subjects work longer and earn more money than if expectations are low."

In periods of major technological inventions, a decline in the relative importance of initial conditions raises inequality, enhances mobility, and generates a larger concentration of high-ability individuals in technologically advanced sectors, stimulating future technological progress and growth. However, once technologies become more accessible, mobility is diminished and inequality decreases but becomes more persistent. The reduction in the concentration of ability in technologically advanced sectors diminishes the likelihood of technological breakthroughs and slows future growth. User friendliness, therefore, becomes unfriendly to future economic growth."

If there are transaction costs, the expectation of future borrowing constraints should induce individuals to keep a lower proportion of their wealth in the form of illiquid and risky assets. We find support for these propositions in a cross-section of Italian households."

The predictable component of their deviations is well explained by a structural nonequilibrium model of initial responses based on level-k thinking."

The striking finding of our study is that the higher level of wage inequality in the US works to increase the gender differential in the US relative to all the other countries in our sample and fully accounts for the lower gender earnings ratio in the US compared to the Scandinavian countries and Australia (the countries with the smallest gaps). First, US wage-setting institutions are considerably less centralized than in other countries, thus making a finding of the importance of wage structure plausible. Second, the US commitment to policies of equal pay and equal employment opportunity compares positively to the other countries in our sample. Finally, even though the estimated wage inequality effect may include the impact of gender discrimination as it interacts with wage structure, our findings nonetheless suggest an extremely important role for wage inequality in affecting the gender ratio. -from Authors"

"Card D., Mas A., Moretti E., Saez E.",2012,American Economic Review,"We study the effect of disclosing information on peers' salaries on workers' job satisfaction and job search intentions. A randomly chosen subset of employees of the University of California was informed about a new website listing the pay of University employees. We find an asymmetric response to the information about peer salaries: workers with salaries below the median for their pay unit and occupation report lower pay and job satisfaction, while those earning above the median report no higher satisfaction. Likewise, below-median earners report a significant increase in the likelihood of looking for a new job, while above-median earners are unaffected. Thus, job satisfaction depends on relative pay comparisons, and this relationship is nonlinear. Economists have long been interested in the possibility that individuals care about both their absolute income and their income relative to others.1 Recent studies have documented systematic correlations between relative income and job satisfaction (e.g., Clark and Oswald 1996), happiness (e.g., Luttmer 2005 and Solnick and Hemenway 1998), health and longevity (e.g., Marmot 2004), and reward-related brain activity (e.g., Fliessbach et al. 2007).2 Despite confirmatory findings from laboratory experiments (e.g., Fehr and Schmidt 1999), the interpretation of the empirical evidence is not always straightforward.

"Peek J., Rosengren E.S.",2005,American Economic Review,"We examine the misallocation of credit in Japan associated with the perverse incentives faced by banks to provide additional credit to the weakest firms. Firms are more likely to receive additional bank credit if they are in poor financial condition, because troubled Japanese banks have an incentive to allocate credit to severely impaired borrowers in order to avoid the realization of losses on their own balance sheets. This ""evergreening"" behavior is more prevalent among banks that have reported capital ratios close to the required minimum, and is compounded by the incentives arising from extensive corporate affiliations."

Under a Cournot oligopoly, however, carriers are shown to internalize only the congestion they impose on themselves. A toll that captures the uninternalized portion of congestion may then improve the allocation of traffic. The analysis is supported by some rudimentary empirical evidence."

The necessary introduction of drastic measures, which may involve sharp tax increases and expenditure cuts, is usually unpopular and forcibly resisted because of distributional concerns.

We exploit the unique, randomized timing of rebate receipt across households. Households spent 20 to 40 percent of their rebates on nondurable goods during the three-month period in which their rebates arrived, and roughly two-thirds of their rebates cumulatively during this period and the subsequent three-month period. The implied effects on aggregate consumption demand are substantial. Consistent with liquidity constraints, responses are larger for households with low liquid wealth or low income."
"He Z., Krishnamurthy A.",2013,American Economic Review,"We model the dynamics of risk premia during crises in asset markets where the marginal investor is a financial intermediary. Intermediaries face an equity capital constraint. Risk premia rise when the constraint binds, reflecting the capital scarcity. The calibrated model matches the nonlinearity of risk premia during crises and the speed of reversion in risk premia from a crisis back to precrisis levels. We evaluate the effect of three government policies: reducing intermediaries borrowing costs, injecting equity capital, and purchasing distressed assets. Injecting equity capital is particularly effective because it alleviates the equity capital constraint that drives the model's crisis."
"Grossman G.M., Helpman E.",1990,American Economic Review,"Recent papers by Romer and Lucas have reminded us that when investment takes place in an economic environment with increasing returns to scale, the marginal product of capital need not decline over time to the level of the discount rate. Then the incentive to accumulate capital may persist indefinitely, and long-run growth in per capita income can be sustained. These astute observations have revitalized the theory of economic growth. Research attention has focused primarily on the processes of accumulation of knowledge capital, in part because the public good aspects of knowledge as information naturally create increasing returns to scale in many contexts. The advances in growth theory enable us to address rigorously many issues that have long been central to international economics. Growth theorists also stand to gain from recognizing how the international economic environment impinges upon the incentives that firms in specific countries have to invest in the creation of knowledge. Several features of the global economy seem especially important for understanding growth performance. Various aspects of the international trade environment have featured prominently in our own work on innovation and growth in the open economy. In the next section we describe common elements of our research approach. Then, in Section II, we introduce a highly simplified model of trade, knowledge accumulation, and growth, and use it to expound some of our recent findings. -from Authors"
"Muller N.Z., Mendelsohn R., Nordhaus W.",2011,American Economic Review,"This study presents a framework to include environmental externalities into a system of national accounts. The paper estimates the air pollution damages for each industry in the United States. An integrated- assessment model quantifies the marginal damages of air pollution emissions for the US which are multiplied times the quantity of emissions by industry to compute gross damages. Solid waste combustion, sewage treatment, stone quarrying, marinas, and oil and coal-fired power plants have air pollution damages larger than their value added. The largest industrial contributor to external costs is coal-fired electric generation, whose damages range from 0.8 to 5.6 times value added."

We construct a model affirms' technology and behavior, taking advantage of the analytical framework provided in the cost-function-based applied production-theory literature, and apply it to state-level data for U.S. manufacturing. We find that infrastructure investment provides a significant return to manufacturing firms and augments productivity growth. The net benefits of infrastructure investment may or may not be positive, depending upon the social costs of infrastructure investment and the relative growth rates of output and infrastructure."

In treatment schools, teachers' attendance was monitored daily using cameras, and their salaries were made a nonlinear function of attendance. Teacher absenteeism in the treatment group fell by 21 percentage points relative to the control group, and the children's test scores increased by 0.17 standard deviations. We estimate a structural dynamic labor supply model and find that teachers respond strongly to financial incentives. Our model is used to compute cost-minimizing compensation policies."

Three years after the lotteries, winners were about 10 percentage points more likely to have finished 8th grade, primarily because they were less likely to repeat grades, and scored 0.2 standard deviations higher on achievement tests. There is some evidence that winners worked less than losers and were less likely to marry or cohabit as teenagers. Benefits to participants likely exceeded the $24 per winner additional cost to the government of supplying vouchers instead of publicschool places."
Hines Jr. J.R.,1996,American Economic Review,"This paper compares the distribution between U.S. states of investment from countries that grant foreign tax credits with investment from all other countries. The ability to apply foreign tax credits against home-country tax liabilities reduces an investor's incentive to avoid high-tax foreign locations. State corporate tax rate differences of 1 percent are associated with differences of 9-11 percent between the investment shares of foreign-tax-credit investors and the investment shares of all others, suggesting that state taxes significantly influence the pattern of foreign direct investment in the United States."

"Ljungqvist L., Uhlig H.",2000,American Economic Review,"This paper examines the role for tax policies in productivity-shock driven economies with catching-up-with-the-Joneses utility functions. The optimal tax policy is shown to affect the economy countercyclically via procyclical taxes, i.e., ""cooling down"" the economy with higher taxes when it is ""overheating"" in booms and ""stimulating"" the economy with lower taxes in recessions to keep consumption up. Thus, models with catching-up-with-the-Joneses utility functions call for traditional Keynesian demand-management policies but for rather unorthodox reasons."

Distance to the HIV results centers was also randomly assigned. Without any incentive, 34 percent of the articipants learned their HIV results. However, even the smallest incentive doubled that share. Using the randomly assigned incentives and distance from results centers as instruments for the knowledge of HIV status, sexually active HIV-positive individuals who learned their results are three times more likely to purchase condoms two months later than sexually active HIV-positive individuals who did not learn their results; however, HIV-positive individuals who learned their results purchase only two additional condoms than those who did not. There is no significant effect of learning HIV-negative status on the purchase of condoms."

Without asymmetric information, past work showed that small open economies should not impose corporate income taxes. With asymmetric information, the optimal policy instead involves government subsidies to capital imports. Some omitted factors that argue against subsidizing capital imports are explored briefly."

Risk acceptance was calibrated by asking individuals their ""minimum acceptable probability"" (MAP) for securing the high payoff that would make them willing to accept the risky rather than the sure payoff. People's MAPs are generally higher when another person, rather than nature, determines the outcome. This indicates betrayal aversion."

Using direct mail solicitations to over 50,000 prior donors of a nonprofit organization, we tested the effectiveness of a matching grant on charitable giving. We find that the match offer increases both the revenue per solicitation and the response rate. Larger match ratios (i.e., $3:$1 and $2:$1) relative to a smaller match ratio ($1:$1) had no additional impact, however. The results provide avenues for future empirical and theoretical work on charitable giving, cost-benefit analysis, and the private provision of public goods."

We find very different results for ""cooperative"" investments that directly benefit the investor's partner (e.g., the seller's investment improves the buyer's value of the good). Most importantly, if committing not to renegotiate the contract is impossible, then contracting has no value, i.e., the parties cannot do better than to abandon contracting altogether in favor of ex post negotiation."
Caselli F.,1999,American Economic Review,"In skill-biased (de-skilling) technological revolutions learning investments required by new machines are greater (smaller) than those required by preexisting machines. Skill-biased (de-skilling) revolutions trigger reallocations of capital from slow-(fast-) to fast-(slow-) learning workers, thereby reducing the relative and absolute wages of the former. The model of skill-biased (de-skilling) revolutions provides insight into developments since the mid-1970's (in the 1910's). The empirical work documents a large increase in the interindustry dispersion of capital-labor ratios since 1975. Changes in industry capital intensity are related to the skill composition of the labor force."
Darby M.R.,1982,American Economic Review,"The increase in the real price of oil during 1973-74 is widely believed to have been a major cause of inflation and recession both in the US and abroad. This belief is based primarily upon the view that imported oil, or energy more generally, is a third factor in the aggregate production function. Hence an increase in oil's relative price will cause an adverse shift in the aggregate supply curve that produces a higher price level and lower output. Although theoretically consistent, this requires parameter values which some economists have found implausible. Reports new evidence on the empirical importance of the oil-price effects.-Author"
"Comin D., Gertler M.",2006,American Economic Review,"Over the postwar period, many industrialized countries have experienced significant medium-frequency oscillations between periods of robust growth versus relative stagnation. Conventional business cycle filters, however, tend to sweep these oscillations into the trend. In this paper we explore whether they may, instead, reflect a persistent response of economic activity to the high-frequency fluctuations normally associated with the cycle. We define as the medium-term cycle the sum of the high-and medium-frequency variation in the data, and then show that these kinds of fluctuations are substantially more volatile and persistent than are the conventional measures. These fluctuations, further, feature significant procyclical movements in both embodied and disembodied technological change, and research and development (R&D), as well as the efficiency and intensity of resource utilization. We then develop a model of medium-term business cycles. A virtue of the framework is that, in addition to offering a unified approach to explaining the high- and mediumfrequency variation in the data, it fully endogenizes the movements in productivity that appear central to the persistence of these fluctuations. For comparison, we also explore how well an exogenous productivity model can explain the facts."

Higher-income countries use skilled labor more efficiently than lower-income countries, while they use unskilled labor relatively and, possibly, absolutely less efficiently. We also propose a simple explanation for our findings: rich countries, which are skilled-labor abundant, choose technologies that are best suited to skilled workers; poor countries, which are unskilled-labor abundant, choose technologies more appropriate to unskilled workers. We discuss alternative explanations, such as capital-skill complementarity and differences in schooling quality."

Industries more exposed to the change experience greater employment loss, increased imports from China, and higher entry by US importers and foreign- owned Chinese exporters. At the plant level, shifts toward less labor- intensive production and exposure to the policy via input- output linkages also contribute to the decline in employment. Results are robust to other potential explanations of employment loss, and there is no similar reaction in the European Union, where policy did not change."

In addition, women are more risk averse than men, risk aversion exhibits a U-shape with respect to age, and proxies for income and wealth are positively associated with absolute risk aversion. Finally, unobserved heterogeneity in risk aversion is greater than that of risk, and, as we illustrate, has important implications for insurance pricing."

Law firms use indicators of this propensity - especially an associate's record of billable hours - in promotion decisions.

Our results suggest that court-ordered finance reform reduced within-state inequality in spending by 19 to 34 percent. Successful litigation reduced inequality by raising spending in the poorest districts while leaving spending in the richest districts unchanged, thereby increasing aggregate spending on education. Reform led states to fund additional spending through higher state taxes."

We estimate a stochastic volatility process for real interest rates. Then, we feed this process in a standard small open economy business cycle model.

Moser P.,2005,American Economic Review,"Studies of innovation have focused on the effects of patent laws on the number of innovations, but have ignored effects on the direction of technological change. This paper introduces a new dataset of close to fifteen thousand innovations at the Crystal Palace World's Fair in 1851 and at the Centennial Exhibition in 1876 to examine the effects of patent laws on the direction of innovation. The paper tests the following argument: if innovative activity is motivated by expected profits, and if the effectiveness of patent protection varies across industries, then innovation in countries without patent laws should focus on industries where alternative mechanisms to protect intellectual property are effective. Analyses of exhibition data for 12 countries in 1851 and 10 countries in 1876 indicate that inventors in countries without patent laws focused on a small set of industries where patents were less important, while innovation in countries with patent laws appears to be much more diversified. These findings suggest that patents help to determine the direction of technical change and that the adoption of patent laws in countries without such laws may alter existing patterns of comparative advantage across countries."

We find that male working - class - lower-caste - networks continue to channel boys into local language schools that lead to the traditional occupation, despite the fact that returns to nontraditional white-collar occupations rose substantially in the 1990s, suggesting the possibility of a dynamic inefficiency. In contrast, lower-caste girls, who historically had low labor market participation rates and so did not benefit from the network, are taking full advantage of the opportunities that became available in the new economy by switching rapidly to English schools."

Employing panel data from arts and social service organizations, we find that government grants cause significant reductions in fund-raising. This adds a new dimension to the policy discussions - analysts should account for the behavioral responses of the charity, as well as the donors, to government grants."

We find that such contracts can induce one party to invest efficiently when courts impose either a breach remedy of specific performance or expectation damages. Moreover specific performance can induce both parties to invest efficiently if a separability condition holds. Expectation damages, on the other hand, is poorly suited to solve bilateral investment problems."

As risk aversion increases, the myopic component of risky asset demand disappears but the intertemporal hedging component does not. Conservative investors hold assets to hedge the risk that real interest rates will decline. Long-term inflation-indexed bonds are most suitable for this purpose, but nominal bonds may also be used if inflation risk is low."
"Fehr E., Goette L.",2007,American Economic Review,"Most previous studies on intertemporal labor supply found very small or insignificant substitution effects. It is possible that these results are due to constraints on workers' labor supply choices. We conducted afield experiment in a setting in which workers were free to choose hours worked and effort per hour. We document a large positive elasticity of overall labor supply and an even larger elasticity of hours, which implies that the elasticity of effort per hour is negative. We examine two candidate models to explain these findings: a modified neoclassical model with preference spillovers across periods, and a model with reference dependent, loss-averse preferences. With the help of a further experiment, we can show that only loss-averse individuals exhibit a negative effort response to the wage increase."
"Gabaix X., Laibson D., Moloche G., Weinberg S.",2006,American Economic Review,"The directed cognition model assumes that agents use partially myopic option-value calculations to select their next cognitive operation. The current paper tests this model by studying information acquisition in two experiments. In the first experiment, information acquisition has an explicit financial cost. In the second experiment, information acquisition is costly because time is scarce. The directed cognition model successfully predicts aggregate information acquisition patterns in these experiments. When the directed cognition model and the fully rational model make demonstrably different predictions, the directed cognition model better matches the laboratory evidence."

Since interest groups cannot enforce fee-for-service contracts with legislators, legislators have an incentive to create specialized, standing committees which foster repeated dealing between interests and committee members. The resulting reputational equilibrium supports high contributions and high legislative effort for the interests. Contribution patterns by competing interests in the congressional battle over whether banks can enter new businesses support the theory, which also has implications for term limits and campaign reform.

Agents choose their actions by imitating others who earn high payoffs. Interactions between agents are local, so that each agent affects (and is affected by) only his neighbors. Altruists can survive in such a world if they are grouped together, so that the benefits of altruism are enjoyed primarily by other Altruists, who then earn relatively high payoffs and are imitated. Altruists continue to survive in the presence of mutations that continually introduce Egoists into the population."

"Conti G., Heckman J., Urzua S.",2010,American Economic Review,"The research reported in CHU examines the early origins of health disparities across education groups. We determine the role played by early cognitive, noncognitive, and health endowments. We identify the causal effect of education on health and health-related behaviors. We develop an empirical model of schooling choice and post-schooling outcomes, where both schooling and the outcomes determined in part by schooling are influenced by measured early family environments and latent capabilities (cognitive, noncognitive, and health). We show that family background characteristics, and cognitive, noncognitive, and health endowments developed by age ten, are important determinants of labor market and health disparities at age 30. Not properly accounting for personality traits overestimates the importance of cognitive ability in determining adult health. Selection on factors determined early in life explains more than half of the observed difference by education in poor health, depression, and obesity. Education has an important causal effect in explaining differences in many adult outcomes and healthy behaviors. We uncover significant gender differences. We go beyond the current literature which typically estimates mean effects to compute distributions of treatment effects. We show how the health returns to education can vary among individuals who are similar with respect to their observed characteristics, and how a mean effect can hide gains and losses for different individuals. Our research highlights the important role played by the early years in producing health."

Unemployment duration is three times longer in Portugal than in the United States. Symmetrically, flows of workers into unemployment are three times lower in Portugal. These lower flows come in roughly equal proportions from lower job creation and destruction, and from lower worker flows given job creation and destruction. A plausible explanation is high employment protection in Portugal. High employment protection makes economies more sclerotic; but because it affects unemployment duration and worker flows in opposite directions, the effect on unemployment is ambiguous."

Bianchi J.,2011,American Economic Review,"Credit constraints linking debt to market-determined prices embody a systemic credit externality that drives a wedge between competitive and constrained socially optimal equilibria, inducing private agents to overborrow.

We conduct a quantitative analysis of this externality in a two-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model of a small open economy calibrated to emerging markets. Raising the cost of borrowing during tranquil times restores constrained efficiency and significantly reduces the incidence and severity of financial crises."

Romalis J.,2004,American Economic Review,This paper examines how factor proportions determine the structure of commodity trade. It integrates a many-country version of a Heckscher-Ohlin model with a continuum of goods with Paul R. Krugman's (1980) model of monopolistic competition and transport costs. The commodity structure of production and bilateral trade is fully determined. Two main predictions emerge. Countries capture larger shares of world production and trade of commodities that more intensively use their abundant factors. Countries that rapidly accumulate a factor see their production and export structures systematically shift towards industries that intensively use that factor. Both predictions receive support from detailed trade data.

Polluting industries spread out, moving from nonattainment (polluted) to attainment (initially less polluted) areas.

Prendergast C.,2007,American Economic Review,"Many individuals are motivated to exert effort because they care about their jobs, rather than because there are monetary consequences to their actions. The intrinsic motivation of bureaucrats is the focus of this paper, and three primary results are shown. First, bureaucrats should be biased. Second, sometimes this bias takes the form of advocating for their clients more than would their principal, while in other cases, they are more hostile to their interests. For a range of bureaucracies, those who are biased against clients lead to more efficient outcomes. Third, self-selection need not produce the desired bias. Instead, selection to bureaucracies is likely to be bifurcated, in the sense that it becomes composed of those who are most preferred by the principal, and those who are least preferred."
"Biais B., Perotti E.",2002,American Economic Review,"We analyze politically motivated privatization in a bipartisan environment. When median-class voters a priori favor redistributive policies, a strategic privatization program allocating them enough shares can induce a voting shift away from left-wing parties whose policy would reduce the value of shareholdings. To induce median-class voters to buy enough shares to shift political preferences, strategic rationing and underpricing is often necessary. In the extreme, this may lead to free share distribution and voucher privatization. Shifting voting preferences becomes impossible when strong ex ante political constraints require large upfront transfers to insiders or when social inequality is extreme."

Political leaders expend effort according to their chance of being pivotal, which depends on the expected closeness of the race (at both state and national levels) and how voters respond to their effort. Structural estimation supports this model. For example, a 1-percent increase in the predicted closeness at the state level stimulates leaders ' efforts, which increases turnout by 0.34 percent."

"Benhabib J., Schmitt-Grohé S., Uribe M.",2001,American Economic Review,"This paper characterizes conditions under which interest-rate feedback rules that set the nominal interest rate as an increasing function of the inflation rate induce aggregate instability by generating multiple equilibria. It shows that these conditions depend not only on the monetary-fiscal regime (as emphasized in the fiscal theory of the price level) but also on the way in which money is assumed to enter preferences and technology. It provides a number of examples in which, contrary to what is commonly believed, active monetary policy gives rise to multiple equilibria and passive monetary policy renders the equilibrium unique."
McLaren J.,2000,American Economic Review,"This paper analyzes the effects of international openness on vertical integration. Vertical integration can confer a negative externality, by thinning the market for inputs and thus worsening opportunism problems; this induces strategic complementarity and multiple equilibria in the integration decision, thus providing a theory of different ""industrial systems"" or ""industrial cultures"" in ex ante identical countries. International openness thickens the market, facilitating leaner, less integrated firms, thus providing gains from international openness quite different from those that are familiar from trade theory. This may be taken as one theory of ""outsourcing,"" ""downsizing,"" and ""Japanization"" as consequences of ""globalization""."

The theoretical case for this approach rests on the assumption of an efficient market for emission rights. Our empirical analysis shows that the emission rights market created by the 1990 Amendments had become reasonably efficient by mid-1994. We also show that the auctions specified in the Amendments to jump-start trading had become a small part of the overall market. Finally, we demonstrate that the strategic bidding behavior discussed in the literature has had no effect on market prices."

The bureaucrat is preferable for technical tasks for which ability is more important than effort, or if there is great uncertainty about whether the policymaker has the required abilities. The optimal allocation of redistributive tasks is ambiguous, and depends on how the bureaucrat can be instructed. But irrespective of the normative conclusion, the politician prefers not to delegate redistributive policies."

Consistent with the predictions of the theoretical literature on research consortia, we find consortium outcomes are positively associated with the level of potential R&D spillovers within the consortium and (weakly) negatively associated with the degree of product market competition among consortium members. Furthermore, our evidence suggests that consortia are most effective when they focus on basic research."
"Greenstone M., Hanna R.",2014,American Economic Review,"Using the most comprehensive developing country dataset ever compiled on air and water pollution and environmental regulations, the paper assesses India's environmental regulations with a difference-in-differences design. The air pollution regulations are associated with substantial improvements in air quality. The most successful air regulation resulted in a modest but statistically insignificant decline in infant mortality. In contrast, the water regulations had no measurable benefits. The available evidence leads us to cautiously conclude that higher demand for air quality prompted the effective enforcement of air pollution regulations, indicating that strong public support allows environmental regulations to succeed in weak institutional settings. © 2014, American Economic Association.

"Mertens K., Ravn M.O.",2013,American Economic Review,This paper estimates the dynamic effects of changes in taxes in the United States. We distinguish between changes in personal and corporate income taxes and develop a new narrative account of federal tax liability changes in these two tax components. We develop an estimator which uses narratively identified tax changes as proxies for structural tax shocks and apply it to quarterly post-WWII data. We find that short run output effects of tax shocks are large and that it is important to distinguish between different types of taxes when considering their impact on the labor market and on expenditure components.
"Alesina A., Zhuravskaaya E.",2011,American Economic Review,"We provide a new compilation of data on ethnic, linguistic, and religious composition at the subnational level for a large number of countries.

To overcome the endogeneity problem that arises because of mobility and endogenous internal borders, we construct an instrument for segregation. We find that more ethnically and linguistically segregated countries, i.e., those where groups live more spatially separately, have a lower quality of government; there is no relationship between religious segregation and governance. Trust is an important channel of influence; it is lower in more segregated countries."

Unlike the HIE, however, we find substantial ""offset"" effects in terms of increased hospital utilization. The savings from increased cost sharing accrue mostly to the supplemental insurer, while the costs of increased hospitalization accrue mostly to Medicare."

Household choice parameters derive from an estimation procedure that integrates individual choices for car ownership and miles traveled.

Taking account of revenue recycling, the impact of a 25-cent gasoline tax increase on the average household is about $30 per year (2001 dollars). Distributional impacts depend importantly on how additional revenues from the tax increase are recycled. (JEL D12, H22, H25, L62, L71)."

Like the American market, these markets have experienced failures that led to the adoption of centralized market mechanisms. Because different regions employ different centralized mechanisms, these markets provide a test of the hypothesis that the success of the American market is related to the fact that it produces matches which are stable in the sense that no two agents mutually prefer to be matched to one another than to their assigned partners. Even in the more complex U.K. markets, this kind of stability plays an important role. Centralized markets that produced unstable matches in environments in which agents could act upon instabilities fared no better than the decentralized markets they replaced."

Using an original survey of people playing the lottery in Massachusetts in the mid-1980's, we analyze the effects of the magnitude of lottery prizes on economic behavior. The critical assumption is that among lottery winners the magnitude of the prize is randomly assigned. We find that unearned income reduces labor earnings, with a marginal propensity to consume leisure of approximately 11 percent, with larger effects for individuals between 55 and 65 years old. After receiving about half their prize, individuals saved about 16 percent."

Using a new index of financial liberalization, we find that influential events shook the policy status quo. Balance-of-payments crises spurred reforms, but banking crises set liberalization back. Falling global interest rates strengthened reformers, while new governments went both ways. The overall trend toward liberalization, however, reflected pressures and incentives generated by initial reforms that raised the likelihood of additional reforms, stimulated further by the need to catch up with regional reform leaders. In contrast, ideology and country structure had limited influence."

In reality investors acquire wealth not just for its implied consumption, but for the resulting social status. Max M. Weber refers to this desire for wealth as the spirit of capitalism. We examine, both analytically and empirically, implications of Weber's hypothesis for consumption, savings, and stock prices. When investors care about relative social status, propensity to consume and risk-taking behavior will depend on social standards, and stock prices will be volatile. The spirit of capitalism seems to be a driving force behind stock-market volatility and economic growth."

We use these estimates to study the impact of policies that nudge consumers toward better decisions by reducing inertia. When aggregated, these improved individual-level choices substantially exacerbate adverse selection in our setting, leading to an overall reduction in welfare that doubles the existing welfare loss from adverse selection."

"Bushnell J.B., Mansur E.T., Saravia C.",2008,American Economic Review,"This paper examines vertical arrangements in electricity markets. Vertically integrated wholesalers, or those with long-term contracts, have less incentive to raise wholesale prices when retail prices are determined beforehand. For three restructured markets, we simulate prices that define bounds on static oligopoly equilibria. Our findings suggest that vertical arrangements dramatically affect estimated market outcomes. Had regulators impeded vertical arrangements (as in California), our simulations imply vastly higher prices than observed and production inefficiencies costing over 45 percent of those production costs with vertical arrangements. We conclude that horizontal market structure accurately predicts market performance only when accounting for vertical structure."
Gourio F.,2012,American Economic Review,"Motivated by the evidence that risk premia are large and countercyclical, this paper studies a tractable real business cycle model with a small risk of economic disaster, such as the Great Depression. An increase in disaster risk leads to a decline of employment, output, investment, stock prices, and interest rates, and an increase in the expected return on risky assets. The model matches well data on quantities, asset prices, and particularly the relations between quantities and prices, suggesting that variation in aggregate risk plays a significant role in some business cycles."

Doubling shopping frequency lowers a good's price by 7 to 10 percent. We estimate the shopper's price of time and use this series to estimate an elasticity of substitution between time and goods in home production of roughly 1.8. The observed life-cycle time allocation implies a consumption series that differs markedly from expenditures."

This led to a substantial increase in certification rates for girls but had no effect on boys. Affected girls had a relatively high ex ante chance of certification. The increase in girls' matriculation rates translated into an increased likelihood of college attendance. Female matriculation rates increased partly because treated girls devoted extra time to exam preparation. (JEL I21, I28, J16)."

In this model, it is demonstrated that school-district targeted vouchers are similar in their impact to nontargeted vouchers but vastly different from vouchers targeted to low-income households. Furthermore, strong migration effects are shown to significantly improve the likely equity consequences of voucher programs."

This finding is robust to a number of changes in the specification. It also holds for several proxies for nondurables and services consumption created by combining PSID variables with weights estimated from Consumer Expenditure Survey data."

Borenstein S.,1990,American Economic Review,"Although the laissez-faire antitrust policies of the 1980s affected market structure in many US industries, the effects have probably been most visible in the airline industry. In the last few years, there has been increasing focus on the market power that an airline may obtain when it offers most of the service from an airport. This paper analyzes the effects of two controversial airline mergers that resulted in airport dominance and may have created substantial market power. Both acquisitions occurred in the fall of 1986 - Northwest's merger with Republic Airlines and Trans World Airlines' purchase of Ozark Airlines. In each case, the merger left the surviving carrier with more than three-quarters of the traffic at the major hub airport where the merging airlines had competed. -from Author"
Duranton G.,2007,American Economic Review,"With the use of French and US data, new and systematic evidence is provided about the rapid location changes of industries across cities (the fast). Cities are also slowly moving up and down the urban hierarchy (the slow), while the size distribution of cities is skewed to the right and very stable (the still). The model proposed here reproduces these three features. Small, innovation-driven shocks lead to the churning of industries across cities. Then, cities slowly grow or decline following net gains or losses of industries. These changes occur within a stable distribution. The quantitative implications of the model are also explored."
"Burnside C., Eichenbaum M.",1996,American Economic Review,"This paper analyzes the role of variable capital-utilization rates in propagating shocks over the business cycle.

We argue that variable capital-utilization rates are a quantitatively important source of propagation to business-cycle shocks. With this additional source of propagation, the volatility of exogenous technology shocks needed to explain the observed variability in aggregate U.S. output is significantly reduced relative to standard real-business-cycle models."
"Brunnermeier M.K., Nagel S.",2008,American Economic Review,"We use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to investigate how households' portfolio allocations change in response to wealth fluctuations. Persistent habits, consumption commitments, and subsistence levels can generate time-varying risk aversion with the consequence that when the level of liquid wealth changes, the proportion a household invests in risky assets should also change in the same direction. In contrast, our analysis shows that the share of liquid assets that households invest in risky assets is not affected by wealth changes. Instead, one of the major drivers of household portfolio allocation seems to be inertia: households rebalance only very slowly following inflows and outflows or capital gains and losses."
Knight B.,2002,American Economic Review,"Contrary to simple theoretical predictions, existing evidence suggests that federal grants do not crowd out state government spending. A legislative bargaining model with endogenous grants documents a positive correlation between grant receipts and preferences for public goods; this correlation has likely biased existing work against measuring crowd-out. To correct for such endogeneity, the model motivates instruments based on the political power of state congressional delegations. Exploiting this exogenous variation in grants, the instrumental variables estimator reports crowd-out that is statistically and economically significant. This endogeneity may explain the flypaper effect, a nonequivalence between grant receipts and private income."

This paper examines two potential benefits of a multilateral trade institution: first, verifying violations of the agreements and informing third parties, thus facilitating multilateral reputation mechanisms; second, promoting multilateral trade negotiations rather than a web of bilateral negotiations. The model suggests that a multilateral approach is particularly important when there are strong imbalances in bilateral trading relationships."

Dafny L.S.,2005,American Economic Review,"This paper examines hospital responses to changes in diagnosis-specific prices by exploiting a 1988 policy reform that generated large price changes for 43 percent of Medicare admissions. I find hospitals responded primarily by ""upcoding"" patients to diagnosis codes with the largest price increases. This response was particularly strong among for-profit hospitals. I find little evidence hospitals increased the volume of admissions differentially for diagnoses subject to the largest price increases, despite the financial incentive to do so. Neither did they increase intensity or quality of care in these diagnoses, suggesting hospitals do not compete for patients at the diagnosis level."
"Busse M.R., Knittel C.R., Zettelmeyer F.",2013,American Economic Review,"We investigate whether car buyers are myopic about future fuel costs. We estimate the effect of gasoline prices on short-run equilibrium prices of cars of different fuel economies. We then compare the implied changes in willingness-to-pay to the associated changes in expected future gasoline costs for cars of different fuel economies in order to calculate implicit discount rates. Using different assumptions about annual mileage, survival rates, and demand elasticities, we calculate a range of implicit discount rates similar to the range of interest rates paid by car buyers who borrow. We interpret this as showing little evidence of consumer myopia. Copyright © 2013 by the American Economic Association."

We document this to be the case across countries and within disaggregated sectors. This finding contradicts the assumption in an important class of models that the currency of pricing is exogenous. We present a model of endogenous currency choice in a dynamic price setting environment and show that the predictions of the model are strongly supported by the data."
"Mayer C., Sinai T.",2003,American Economic Review,"We examine two factors that explain air traffic congestion: network benefits due to hubbing and congestion externalities. While both factors impact congestion, we find that the hubbing effect dominates empirically. Hub carriers incur most of the additional travel time from hubbing, primarily because they cluster their flights in short time spans to provide passengers as many potential connections as possible with a minimum of waiting time. Non-hub flights at the same hub airports operate with minimal additional travel time. These results suggest that an optimal congestion tax might have a relatively small impact on flight patterns at hub airports."
"Parente S.L., Prescott E.C.",1999,American Economic Review,"Our thesis is that poor countries are poor because they employ arrangements for which the equilibrium outcomes are characterized by inferior technologies being used, and being used inefficiently.

In each industry, the arrangement enables a coalition of factor suppliers to be the monopoly seller of its input services to all firms using a particular production process. We find that eliminating this monopoly arrangement could well increase output by roughly a factor of 3 without any increase in inputs. (JEL D58, O11, O41)."

We find that importing all input varieties would increase a firm's revenue productivity by 22 percent, about one-half of which is due to imperfect substitution between foreign and domestic inputs. Foreign firms use imports more effectively and pay lower fixed import costs. We attribute one-quarter of Hungarian productivity growth during the 1993-2002 period to imported inputs. Simulations show that the productivity gain from a tariff cut is larger when the economy has many importers and many foreign firms."

Using plant-level data, lumpy investment is procyclical and more likely for older capital. Further, the predicted path of aggregate investment that neglects vintage effects tracks actual aggregate investment reasonably well. However, ignoring fluctuations in the cross-sectional distribution of investment vintages can yield predictable nontrivial errors in forecasting changes in aggregate investment."

While local labor demand changes fundamentally caused the increased skill sorting, it was further fueled by endogenous increases in amenities within higher skill cities.

"Acemoglu D., Restrepo P.",2018,American Economic Review,"We examine the concerns that new technologies will render labor redundant in a framework in which tasks previously performed by labor can be automated and new versions of existing tasks, in which labor has a comparative advantage, can be created. In a static version where capital is fixed and technology is exogenous, automation reduces employment and the labor share, and may even reduce wages, while the creation of new tasks has the opposite effects. Our full model endogenizes capital accumulation and the direction of research toward automation and the creation of new tasks. If the long-run rental rate of capital relative to the wage is sufficiently low, the long-run equilibrium involves automation of all tasks. Otherwise, there exists a stable balanced growth path in which the two types of innovations go hand-in-hand. Stability is a consequence of the fact that automation reduces the cost of producing using labor, and thus discourages further automation and encourages the creation of new tasks. In an extension with heterogeneous skills, we show that inequality increases during transitions driven both by faster automation and the introduction of new tasks, and characterize the conditions under which inequality stabilizes in the long run. © 2018 American Economic Association.

"Howarth R.B., Norgaard R.B.",1992,American Economic Review,"Reasoning from a general-equilibrium framework, we show that the valuation of environmental services and how society cares for the future are interdependent. Valuation when there is too little caring for the future (ie, too little asset transfer) will not lead to sustainability. With sufficient caring for the future, environmental valuation yields different results. Overlapping-generations models facilitate this change in perspective through the provision of discrete generations to which rights can be assigned or assets transferred. With a general-equilibrium model, we discover how interest or discount rates, which reflect the marginal time preference of individuals rather than social concerns over intergenerational equity, vary with asset transfers. From a general-equilibrium framework we see that the valuation of nonmarket goods and social objectives are intertwined. Economic valuation brings a society closer to its goals by increasing the efficiency of the economy. -from Authors"

"Hummels D.L., Schaur G.",2013,American Economic Review,"A large and growing share of world trade travels by air. We model exporters' choice between fast, expensive air cargo and slow, cheap ocean cargo, which depends on the price elasticity of demand and the value that consumers attach to fast delivery. We use US imports data that provide rich variation in the premium paid for air shipping and in time lags for ocean transit to extract consumers' valuation of time. We estimate that each day in transit is equivalent to an advalorem tariff of 0.6 to 2.1 percent. The most time-sensitive trade flows involve parts and components trade."
"Crawford V.P., Meng J.",2011,American Economic Review,"This paper proposes a model of cab drivers' labor supply, building on Henry S. Farber's (2005, 2008) empirical analyses and Botond Ko.szegi and Matthew Rabin's (2006; henceforth ""KR"") theory of reference-dependent preferences. Following KR, our model has targets for hours as well as income, determined by proxied rational expectations. Our model, estimated with Farber's data, reconciles his finding that stopping probabilities are significantly related to hours but not income with Colin Camerer et al.'s (1997) negative ""wage"" elasticity of hours; and avoids Farber's criticism that estimates of drivers' income targets are too unstable to yield a useful model of labor supply."
"Dal Bó P., Foster A., Putterman L.",2010,American Economic Review,"A novel experiment is used to show that the effect of a policy on the level of cooperation is greater when it is chosen democratically by the subjects than when it is exogenously imposed. In contrast to the previous literature, our experimental design allows us to control for selection effects (e.g., those who choose the policy may be affected differently by it). Our finding implies that democratic institutions may affect behavior directly in addition to having effects through the choice of policies. Our findings have implications for the generalizability of the results of randomized policy interventions."
Naughton B.,1994,American Economic Review,"One of the most distinctive features of China's transition to a market economy has been the role played by rural township and village enterprises (TVEs). Yet most are ""collectives,' a form of publicly owned enterprise. This feature seems to make them unique: in no other transitional economy has public ownership played such a dynamic role. The success of TVEs, it is argued, is due largely to a set of external conditions to which TVEs are an effective adaptation. TVEs are responses to one of the most distinctive characteristics of the Chinese transition as a whole: the early creation of product markets, which exist for a prolonged period without well-developed markets for factors of production or assets. TVEs are a flexible and effective but basically ordinary adaptation to this environment. -from Author"

Guided by a model, it then examines whether the transition in and out of democracy under the same president constrains or exacerbates ethnic favoritism. Across the post-independence period, we find strong evidence of ethnic favoritism: districts that share the ethnicity of the president receive twice as much expenditure on roads and have five times the length of paved roads built.

Previous studies, however, look only at the short-run pricing impact of consolidation, ignoring effects that take longer to materialize. Using a database that includes detailed information on the deposit rates of individual banks in local markets for different categories of depositors, we investigate the long-run price effects of mergers. We find strong evidence that, although consolidation does generate adverse price changes, these are temporary. In the long run, efficiency gains dominate over the market power effect, leading to more favorable prices for consumers."

"Ashraf N., Berry J., Shapiro J.M.",2010,American Economic Review,"The controversy over how much to charge for health products in the developing world rests, in part, on whether higher prices can increase use, either by targeting distribution to high-use households (a screening effect), or by stimulating use psychologically through a sunk-cost effect. We develop a methodology for separating these two effects. We implement the methodology in a field experiment in Zambia using door-to-door marketing of a home water purification solution. We find evidence of economically important screening effects. By contrast, we find no consistent evidence of sunk-cost effects."
Weitzman M.L.,2007,American Economic Review,"In textbook expositions of the equity-premium, riskfree-rate and equity-volatility puzzles, agents are sure of the economy's structure while growth rates are normally distributed. But because of parameter uncertainty the thin-tailed normal distribution conditioned on realized data becomes a thick-tailed Student-l distribution, which changes the entire nature of what is considered ""puzzling"" by reversing every inequality discrepancy needing to be explained. This paper shows that Bayesian updating of unknown structural parameters inevitably adds a permanent tail-thickening effect to posterior expectations. The expected-utility ramifications of this for asset pricing are strong, work against the puzzles, and are very sensitive to subjective prior beliefs - even with asymptotically infinite data."

Within job spells, offshoring increases (decreases) the high-skilled (low-skilled) wage; exporting increases the wages of all skill-types; the net wage-effect of trade varies substantially within the same skill-type; conditional on skill, the wage-effect of offshoring varies across task characteristics.

Hornbeck R.,2012,American Economic Review,"The 1930s American Dust Bowl was an environmental catastrophe that greatly eroded sections of the Plains. The Dust Bowl is estimated to have immediately, substantially, and persistently reduced agricultural land values and revenues in more-eroded counties relative to less-eroded counties. During the Depression and through at least the 1950s, there was limited relative adjustment of farmland away from activities that became relatively less productive in more-eroded areas. Agricultural adjustments recovered less than 25 percent of the initial difference in agricultural costs for more-eroded counties. The economy adjusted predominantly through large relative population declines in more-eroded counties, both during the 1930s and through the 1950s."
Ausubel L.M.,2006,American Economic Review,"This article proposes a new dynamic design for auctioning multiple heterogeneous commodities. An auctioneer wishes to allocate K types of commodities among n bidders. The auctioneer announces a vector of current prices, bidders report quantities demanded at these prices, and the auctioneer adjusts the prices. Units are credited to bidders at the current prices as their opponents' demands decline, and the process continues until every commodity market clears. Bidders, rather than being assumed to behave as price-takers, are permitted to strategically exercise their market power. Nevertheless, the proposed auction yields Walrasian equilibrium prices and, as from a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism, an efficient allocation."
"Baker G.P., Hubbard T.N.",2003,American Economic Review,"Explaining patterns of asset ownership is a central goal of both organizational economics and industrial organization.

We find that OBCs' incentive-improving features pushed hauls toward private carriage, but their resource-allocation-improving features pushed them toward far-hire carriage. We conclude that ownership patterns in trucking reflect the importance of both incomplete contracts and of job design and measurement issues."

I find that children in households affected by the demolitions do no better or worse than their peers on a wide variety of achievement measures. Because the majority of households that leave high-rise public housing in response to the demolitions move to neighborhoods and schools that closely resemble those they left, the zero effect of the demolitions may be interpreted as the independent impact of public housing."
"Black S.E., Strahan P.E.",2001,American Economic Review,"Until the middle of the 1970's, regulations constrained banks' ability to enter new markets. Over the subsequent 25 years, states gradually lifted these restrictions. This paper tests whether rents fostered by regulation were shared with labor, and whether firms were discriminating by sharing these rents disproportionately with male workers. We find that average compensation and average wages for banking employees fell after states deregulated. Male wages fell by about 12 percent after deregulation, whereas women's wages fell by only 3 percent, suggesting that rents were shared mainly with men. Women's share of employment in managerial positions also increased following deregulation."
"Bacchetta P., Van Wincoop E.",2000,American Economic Review,"This paper develops a simple general-equilibrium framework to study the effect of the exchange-rate system on trade and welfare. An important feature of the model is deviations from purchasing-power parity, caused by rigid price setting in buyers' currency. In a benchmark model with separable preferences and only monetary shocks, trade is unaffected by the exchange-rate system, consistent with most evidence. In general, both trade and welfare can be higher under either exchange-rate system, depending on preferences and on the monetary-policy rules followed under each system. There is no one-to-one relationship between the levels of trade and welfare across exchange-rate systems."

Both the surge in export volume and the decline in export prices following quota removal are driven by net entry. This outcome is inconsistent with a model in which quotas are allocated based on firm productivity, implying misallocation of resources. Removing this misallocation accounts for a substantial share of the overall gain in productivity associated with quota removal."
"Griffith R., Harrison R., Van Reenen J.",2006,American Economic Review,"The results presented in this paper provide strong evidence for the existence of knowledge spillovers associated with technology sourcing. The idea that foreign firms might invest in R&D activity in a technologically advanced country such as the US in order to gain access to spillovers of new ""tacit"" knowledge has been suggested in the business literature, but we know of no studies that have attempted to find evidence for this in observed productivity outcomes. Our main results suggest that the increase in the US R&D stock in manufacturing between 1990 and 2000 was associated with, on average, a 5-percent-higher level of TFP for the UK firms in our sample, with the majority of the benefits accruing to firms with an innovative presence in the US. This compares with an average 6-percent-higher level of TFP associated with the increase in their own R&D stocks over the same period. Increases in US R&D in the 1990s seem to have had major benefits for the UK economy, and, by implication, for many other countries in the world. We should stress that, because we do not have a convincing instrument for the location of inventive activity, and thus rely on presample information, we can interpret these results only as associations, and not as causal relations. Nonetheless, we believe that they are suggestive, and an interesting extension of our methods would be to replicate the findings for other countries. A larger stock of US R&D should also increase the incentives for multinationals to locate R&D in the US, which is indeed what has occurred. Future research needs to show to what extent this movement in R&D is driven by technology sourcing rather than other potential causes. Our result has interesting implications for policy. Governments are generally keen to promote higher levels of domestic R&D activity, and the member states of the European Union have agreed on a target to raise the level of R&D spending within the European Union to 3 percent of GDP. Our results suggest that policies that seek to achieve this target by inducing European multinationals to relocate their existing R&D efforts away from the US and toward Europe could be counterproductive, as they may reduce the ability of European firms to benefit from US-based R&D spillovers. From an American perspective, our results suggest that while US R&D does generate large spillover benefits for the rest of the world, foreign firms must actually invest in innovative activity in the US in order to reap the full benefits. When it comes to international technology spillovers, it seems there is no such thing as a completely free lunch."

"Calvet L.E., Campbell J.Y., Sodini P.",2009,American Economic Review,"In this paper, we have confirmed earlier evidence that richer, educated households of larger size are less prone to making financial mistakes than other households. These results have motivated the construction of a single index of financial sophistication that best explains a set of three investment mistakes. The index of financial sophistication increases strongly with financial wealth and household size, and to a lesser extent with education and proxies for financial experience, but is lower for self-employed and immigrant households. It is of course difficult to unambiguously establish that any behavior is a mistake, especially when one considers the possibility of nonstandard preferences. B. Douglas Bernheim and Antonio Rangel (2009) do consider both possibilities and acknowledge that mistakes can indeed occur. Our empirical finding that poorer, less educated, immigrant households are more prone to joint deviations from rational benchmarks makes it more plausible that these deviations are indeed mistakes. A more direct approach is to correlate investors' behavior with their cognitive ability and financial literacy (e.g., Kimball and Shumway 2007; Maarten van Rooij, Annamaria Lusardi, and Rob Alessie 2007). We have not pursued this route but believe that it is promising for future research. Another way to detect if an observed behavior is a mistake is to ask whether a household with a high propensity to make mistakes understands that it has such a propensity and alters its behavior as a result. We have reported a strong positive correlation between a household's sophistication index and its share of risky assets. This correlation is consistent with the intuition developed in CCS (2007) that a household is willing to take financial risk when it is confident in its understanding of asset markets and the basic precepts of investing. In a recent and related contribution, Luigi Guiso, Paola Sapienza, and Luigi Zingales (2008) emphasize the role of trust as a key determinant of participation and the risky share. The detailed analysis of these related views of risktaking is left open for further research."

The recent large increase of nearly half a billion poor people came from an inappropriate updating of the global poverty line, not from the ICP revisions. Even so, PPP comparisons between widely different countries rest on weak theoretical and empirical foundations.

We derive a long-run Taylor principle which delivers unique bounded equilibria in two standard models. Policy can satisfy the Taylor principle in the long run, even while deviating from it substantially for brief periods or modestly for prolonged periods. Macroeconomic volatility can be higher in periods when the Taylor principle is not satisfied, not because of indeterminacy, but because monetary policy amplifies the impacts of fundamental shocks.

"De Los Santos B., Hortacsu A., Wildenbeest M.R.",2012,American Economic Review,"Since Stigler's (1961) seminal paper, models of costly search have been at the heart of many economic models trying to explain imperfectly competitive behavior in product and labor markets. The theoretical literature typically models consumer search in two ways. Following Stigler's original model, a strand of literature assumes fixed sample size search behavior, where consumers sample a fixed number of stores and choose to buy the lowest priced alternative.1 A much larger strand of the literature, starting with McCall (1970) and Mortensen (1970), points out that consumers cannot commit to a fixed sample size search strategy in instances where the expected marginal benefit of an extra search exceeds the marginal cost. Thus, this literature argues that a sequential search model provides a better description of actual consumer search."

Additional forces may imply that procyclical R&D is desirable, but equilibrium R&D is likely to be too procyclical, and macroeconomic shocks are likely to have overly persistent effects on output and make growth more costly than in the absence of such shocks."

Eggertsson G.B.,2008,American Economic Review,"This paper suggests that the US recovery from the Great Depression was driven by a shift in expectations. This shift was caused by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's policy actions. On the monetary policy side, Roosevelt abolished the gold standard and - even more importantly - announced the explicit objective of inflating the price level to pre-Depression levels. On the fiscal policy side, Roosevelt expanded real and deficit spending, which made his policy objective credible. These actions violated prevailing policy dogmas and initiated a policy regime change as in Sargent (1983) and Temin and Wigmore (1990). The economic consequences of Roosevelt are evaluated in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with nominal frictions."

We focus our analysis on the years 1869- 1928, and we use the remaining years of data to look at changes over time. We find that newspapers have a robust positive effect on political participation, with one additional newspaper increasing both presidential and congressional turnout by approximately 0.3 percentage points. Newspaper competition is not a key driver of turnout: our effect is driven mainly by the first newspaper in a market, and the effect of a second or third paper is significantly smaller. The effect on presidential turnout diminishes after the introduction of radio and television, while the estimated effect on congressional turnout remains similar up to recent years.

We show that greater contractual incompleteness leads to the adoption of less advanced technologies, and that the impact of contractual incompleteness is more pronounced when there is greater complementary among the intermediate inputs. We study a number of applications of the main framework and show that the mechanism proposed in the paper can generate sizable productivity differences across countries with different contracting institutions, and that differences in contracting institutions lead to endogenous comparative advantage differences."

Hall R.E.,2011,American Economic Review,"In a market-clearing economy, declines in demand from one sector do not cause large declines in aggregate output because other sectors expand. The key price mediating the response is the interest rate. A decline in the rate stimulates all categories of spending. But in a low-inflation economy, the room for a decline in the rate is small, because of the notorious lower limit of zero on the nominal interest rate. In the Great Depression, substantial deflation caused the real interest rate to reach high levels. In the Great Slump that began at the end of 2007, low inflation resulted in an only slightly negative real rate when full employment called for a much lower real rate because of declines in demand. Fortunately, the inflation rate hardly responded to conditions in product and labor markets, else deflation might have occurred, with an even higher real interest rate. I concentrate on three closely related sources of declines in demand: the buildup of excess stocks of housing and consumer durables, the corresponding expansion of consumer debt that financed the buildup, and financial frictions that resulted from the decline in real-estate prices."
Lavy V.,2009,American Economic Review,"Performance-related pay for teachers is being introduced in many countries, amidst much controversy and opposition from teachers and unions alike.1 The rationale for these programs is the notion that incentive pay may motivate teachers to improve their performance. However, there is little evidence of the effect of changes in teachers' incentives in schools. In this paper, I present evidence from an experimental program that offered teachers bonus payments on thebasis of the performance of their classes in high-school matriculation exams in English and mathematics. The bonus program was structured as a rank-order tournament among teachers, separately by subject. Thus, teachers were rewarded on the basis of their performance relative to other teachers of the same subjects. Two measurements of student achievements were used as indicators of teachers' performance: the pass rate and the average score on each matriculation exam. The total amount awarded in each tournament was predetermined, and individual awards were determined on the basis of rank and an award scale. The main interest in this experiment relates to the effect of the program on teachers' pedagogy and effort, on teacher's productivity as measured by students' achievements, and on teachers' grading ethics."

"Blau F.D., Kahn L.M.",1994,American Economic Review,"The US labor market has recently experienced two dramatic trends: a falling male-female pay gap and a rising level of labor-market inequality. After decades of near-constancy at about 60%, the ratio of women's to men's pay has risen steadily since the late 1970's. At the same time, there were substantial increases in overall wage inequality for both men and women. Wage inequality rose both within and between education and experience groups, and this has been interpreted as reflecting primarily higher returns to both measured and unmeasured labor-market skills. This paper addresses the connection between these two important developments. In earlier work, overall wage inequality was found to be very important in explaining international differences in the gender pay gap. The gender pay gap in the US is larger than in most of these countries. An important part of the explanation for this pattern is the high level of wage inequality, which puts an exceptionally large penalty on being below average in the wage distribution. The results suggest that the US gap would be similar to that in countries like Sweden or Australia (the countries with the smallest gaps) if the US had their level of wage inequality. -from Authors"

Kochar A.,1995,American Economic Review,"This paper argues that households in economies such as India's are relatively well protected from idiosyncratic crop shocks. This is attributed not to credit markets, but rather to well-functioning labor markets which enable farm households to smooth such shocks through compensating increases in market hours of work. The ability to smooth income directly reduces the need to resort to the depletion of assets or to costly ex ante measures and may explain the limited empirical evidence in support of such responses. The paper also explores two implications of the use of labor as insurance. The first is that wage income will be ineffectual in protecting households from demographic shocks such as sickness, death, and the disolution of the family unit. A second implication is that the segmentation of labor markets by gender may make a household's vulnerabilty to crop income shocks a function of its demographic composition.

Our econometric model incorporates four structural parameters that vary with observed and unobserved characteristics: utility curvature, loss aversion, preferences toward the timing of uncertainty resolution, and the propensity to choose randomly rather than on the basis of preferences. We find that all f our parameters contribute to explaining choice behavior. The structural parameters are significantly associated with socioeconomic variables, but it is essential to incorporate unobserved heterogeneity in each of them to match the rich variety of choice patterns in the data."
Waugh M.E.,2010,American Economic Review,"I develop a novel view of the trade frictions between rich and poor countries by arguing that to reconcile bilateral trade volumes and price data within a standard gravity model, the trade frictions between rich and poor countries must be systematically asymmetric, with poor countries facing higher costs to export relative to rich countries. I provide a method to model these asymmetries and demonstrate the merits of my approach relative to alternatives in the trade literature. I then argue that these trade frictions are quantitatively important to understanding the large differences in standards of living and total factor productivity across countries."
"Cohn A., Engelmann J., Fehr E., Maréchal M.A.",2015,American Economic Review,"Countercyclical risk aversion can explain major puzzles such as the high volatility of asset prices. Evidence for its existence is, however, scarce because of the host of factors that simultaneously change during financial cycles. We circumvent these problems by priming financial professionals with either a boom or a bust scenario. Subjects primed with a financial bust were substantially more fearful and risk averse than those primed with a boom, suggesting that fear may play an important role in countercyclical risk aversion. The mechanism described here is relevant for theory and may explain self-reinforcing processes that amplify market dynamics."
"Dulleck U., Kerschbamer R., Sutter M.",2011,American Economic Review,"Credence goods markets are characterized by asymmetric information between sellers and consumers that may give rise to inefficiencies, such as under- and overtreatment or market breakdown. We study in a large experiment with 936 participants the determinants for efficiency in credence goods markets. While theory predicts that liability or verifiability yield efficiency, we find that liability has a crucial, but verifiability at best a minor, effect. Allowing sellers to build up reputation has little influence, as predicted. Seller competition drives down prices and yields maximal trade, but does not lead to higher efficiency as long as liability is violated."

Maggi G.,1996,American Economic Review,"This paper develops a model of capacity-price competition in which the equilibrium outcome ranges from the Bertrand to the Cournot outcome as capacity constraints become more important. This model is employed to reexamine aspects of strategic-trade-policy theory and, in particular, the theory's well-known sensitivity to the mode of oligopolistic competition. Among other things, the analysis identifies a simple single-rate policy, namely, capacity subsidies, which can increase the home country's income regardless of the mode of competition. This suggests that the presence of critical informational constraints need not diminish governments' incentives to distort the international competition."

The human brain has always been highly tuned toward narratives, whether factual or not, to justify ongoing actions, even such basic actions as spending and investing. Stories motivate and connect activities to deeply felt values and needs. Narratives ""go viral"" and spread far, even worldwide, with economic impact. The 1920-1921 Depression, the Great Depression of the 1930s, the so-called Great Recession of 2007-2009, and the contentious political- economic situation of today are considered as the results of the popular narratives of their respective times. Though these narratives are deeply human phenomena that are difficult to study in a scientific manner, quantitative analysis may help us gain a better understanding of these epidemics in the future."

Although consumers get convinced that firms which are repeatedly successful in providing high quality are good firms, competition endogenously generates the outside option inducing disappointed consumers to leave firms.

In an instrumental variable sense, house prices are well explained by the credit expansion induced by deregulation."

Poor countries, instead, appear to be plagued by low efficiency in producing investment goods and in producing consumer goods to trade for them."

Results also reveal that industry-level data hide substantial intra-industry heterogeneity, violating the assumptions of the model and complicating the interpretation of results from earlier research.

Once subjects have coordinated on a higher effort level, reductions in the incentives to coordinate have little effect on behavior."

The second explanation is that the composition of output has shifted from very cyclical sectors to less cyclical sectors. The third explanation is that the apparent stabilization is largely spurious and is caused by differences in the way that prewar and postwar business-cycle reference dates were chosen by the NBER (National Bureau of Economic Research).

"Hersch J., Stratton L.S.",1994,American Economic Review,"Housework continues to consume a substantial amount of time, particularly for women. This paper begins by discussing the various methods by which time and effort spent on housework may affect wages and summarize the available empirical evidence. Overall, the empirical evidence indicates that time spent on housework has a negative effect on wages, an effect which is most pronounced for women. It then examines the amount of time spent on housework and the division of that time between working spouses, drawing upon the human-capital literature and the bargaining literature to construct simple regression equations for time spent on housework by each spouse as well as the share of housework time contributed by the husband. The results indicate that husbands do less housework than their wives as their relative earnings and hours spent in the labor market increase. -from Authors"

Guvenen F.,2007,American Economic Review,"The current literature offers two views on the nature of the labor income process. According to the first view, individuals are subject to very persistent income shocks while facing similar life-cycle income profiles (the RIP process, Thomas MaCurdy 1982). According to the alternative, individuals are subject to shocks with modest persistence while facing individual-specific profiles (the HIP process, Lee A. Lillard and Yoram A. Weiss 1979). In this paper we study the restrictions imposed by these two processes on consumption data - in the context of a life-cycle model-to distinguish between the two views. We find that the life-cycle model with a HIP process, which has not been studied in the previous literature, is consistent with several features of consumption data, whereas the model with a RIP process is consistent with some, but not with others. We conclude that the HIP model could be a credible contender to - and along some dimensions, a more coherent alternative than - the RIP model."

In addition, we show that: (a) multiplicity may emerge in the financial price itself; (b) less noise may contribute toward nonfundamental volatility even when the equilibrium is unique; and (c) similar results obtain for a model where individuals observe one another's actions, highlighting the importance of endogenous information more generally."

We find that for each of these years, after we control for differences in income and value-added tax (VAT) rates, there are roughly as many overpriced goods as there are underpriced goods between any two EU countries. We also find that good-by-good measures of cross-sectional price dispersion are negatively related to the tradeability of the good, and positively related to the share of non-traded inputs required to produce the good.

The assumptions used to justify the LATE parameter in a microeconomic setting do not carry over to a general-equilibrium framework. Policy changes, in general, induce two-way flows and violate the monotonicity (or one-way flow) assumption of LATE. We extend the LATE concept to allow for the two-way flows induced by the policies. We present a more comprehensive approach to program evaluation by considering both the tax and benefit consequences of the program being evaluated and placing the analysis in a market setting."
Miles M.A.,1978,American Economic Review,"In this paper it has been argued that there exists a group of individuals within a country who diversify their real cash bal- ance holdings between domestic and foreign currency-denominated balances. These diversified portfolios imply that monetary policy will produce changes in the interest rate that induce offsetting money flows even under perfectly flexible exchange rates. The importance of these offsetting flows will be directly proportional to the degree of substitution between currencies. In the case where currencies are perfect substitutes monetary independence is impossible, even where central banks do not intervene in the foreign exchange markets. Thus the argument that flexible exchange rates imply monetary independence is brought into question. Only to the extent that individuals do not substitute between currencies will the argument be valid. As the empirical tests show, the elasticity of substitution in at least one major country is quite high. The proper model for analyz- ing monetary policy may therefore be one of monetary dependence, not monetary in- dependence, even when perfectly flexible ex- change rates are assumed."

In our data, Internet searchers have observed characteristics that are typically associated with shorter unemployment spells, and do spend less time unemployed. This unemployment differential is however eliminated and in some cases reversed when we hold observable characteristics constant.

"Lalonde R.J., Topel R.H.",1991,American Economic Review,"Immigration to the US during the 1970s and 1980s was greater than in any decade since the 1920s. Simultaneously, the proportion of immigrants arriving from Europe or English-speaking countries declined dramatically from 46% in the 1960s to only 13% in the 1980s. These changes in the pace and composition of immigrant flows have raised three main concerns that have dominated recent literature and policy discussions. First, are recent immigrants less prepared to succeed in the US labor market than their predecessors? Second, do new immigrants recover from their initial earnings disadvantage? The third concern is the distributional impact of immigration on natives' welfare. This paper provides evidence on immigrants' performance and impact in the US labor market. We document that new immigrants do bring fewer marketable skills than did earlier cohorts, and that changes in the source countries of recent immigrants account for all of this decline in immigrant ""quality'. We also show that immigrants assimilate rapidly in the US market and that assimilation is more rapid for groups who start with lower initial wages. These findings imply that immigrants' long-run earnings potential is similar to that of ethnically similar natives. We present additional evidence that increased immigration has had a negligible impact on US workers' wages and employment prospects. -from Authors"

"Furman J.L., Stern S.",2011,American Economic Review,"While cumulative knowledge production is central to growth, little empirical research investigates how institutions shape whether existing knowledge can be exploited to create new knowledge. This paper assesses the impact of a specific institution, a biological resource center, whose objective is to certify and disseminate knowledge. We disentangle the marginal impact of this institution on cumulative research from the impact of selection, in which the most important discoveries are endogenously linked to research-enhancing institutions. Exploiting exogenous shifts of biomaterials across institutional settings and employing a difference-in-differences approach, we find that effective institutions amplify the cumulative impact of individual scientific discoveries."

In this paper we empirically investigate the welfare effects of this requirement on developing countries using data for the fluoroquinolones subsegment of the systemic anti-bacterials segment of the Indian pharmaceutical market. Our results suggest that concerns about the potential adverse welfare effects of TRIPS may have some basis. We estimate that the withdrawal of all domestic products in this subsegment is associated with substantial welfare losses to the Indian economy, even in the presence of price regulation. The overwhelming portion of this welfare loss derives from the loss of consumer welfare."
"Hobijn B., Jovanovic B.",2001,American Economic Review,"Why did the stock market decline so much in the early 1970's and remain low until the early 1980's? We argue that it was because information technology arrived on the scene and the stock-market incumbents of the day were not ready to implement it. Instead, new firms would bring in the new technology after the mid-1980's. Investors foresaw this in the early 1970's and stock prices fell right away. In our model, new capital destroys old capital, but with a lag. The prospect of this causes the value of the old capital to fall right away. (JEL G12, O16, O33)."

Announcing additional monitoring has less impact on transactions that are subject to a paper trail, indicating the paper trail's preventive deterrence effect. This leads to strong enforcement spillovers up the VAT chain.

However, given even minutely asymmetric payoffs, labels lose much of their effectiveness and miscoordination abounds. This raises questions about the extent to which the effectiveness of focal points based on label salience persists beyond the special case of symmetric games. The patterns of miscoordination we observe vary with the magnitude of payoff differences in intricate ways that suggest nonequilibrium accounts based on ""level-k"" thinking and ""team reasoning""."

In other equilibria, even a majority of beneficiaries of redistribution vote strategically so as to induce the end of the welfare state next period.

Although these dimensions of performance cannot be separately identified when firm output is measured by revenue, detailed price deflators make it possible to estimate the average effect of tariff reductions on both. Several novel findings emerge. First, cuts in output tariffs reduce markups, but raise productivity. Second, pro-competitive effects are most important among incumbents, while efficiency gains dominate for new entrants. Third, cuts in input tariffs raise both markups and productivity. We highlight mechanisms that explain these findings in the Chinese context."

"Shiue C.H., Keller W.",2007,American Economic Review,"Why did Western Europe industrialize first? An influential view holds that its exceptionally well-functioning markets supported with a certain set of institutions provided the incentives to make investments needed to industrialize. This paper examines this hypothesis by comparing the actual performance of markets in terms of market integration in Western Europe and China, two regions that were relatively advanced in the preindustrial period, but would start to industrialize about 150 years apart. We find that the performance of markets in China and Western Europe overall was comparable in the late eighteenth century. Market performance in England was higher than in the Yangzi Delta, and markets in England also performed better than those in continental Western Europe. This suggests strong market performance may be necessary, but it is not sufficient for industrialization. Rather than being a key condition for subsequent growth, improvements in market performance and growth occurred simultaneously."

"Compte O., Postlewaite A.",2004,American Economic Review,"There is ample evidence that emotions affect performance. Positive emotions can improve performance, while negative ones can diminish it. For example, the fears induced by the possibility of failure or of negative evaluations have physiological consequences (shaking, loss of concentration) that may impair performance in sports, on stage, or at school. There is also ample evidence that individuals have distorted recollection of past events and distorted attributions of the causes of success or failure. Recollection of good events or successes is typically easier than recollection of bad ones or failures. Successes tend to be attributed to intrinsic aptitudes or effort, while failures are attributed to bad luck. In addition, these attributions are often reversed when judging the performance of others. The objective of this paper is to incorporate the phenomenon that emotions affect performance into an otherwise standard decision theoretic model and show that in a world where performance depends on emotions, biases in information processing enhance welfare."
Amsden A.H.,1991,American Economic Review,"A striking feature of late industrialization is its regional bias. East Asia, both north and south, has encompassed many of the fastest industrializing countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. Between 1960 and 1988, industry grew annually by 10.6% in East Asia, but by only 6.3% in all developing regions. East Asian growth has not been uniform; the Philippine's performance has lagged. For over a decade the Philippines promoted exports, a policy that is sometimes credited with greater East Asia's success. Between 1973-80 and 1980-86, the Philippine's ratio of manufactured exports to manufactured value-added nearly doubled, but its economy stagnated. Thus, the key to understanding East Asia's success must be sought beyond export activity.

"Butcher K.F., Card D.",1991,American Economic Review,"More immigrants entered the US during the past decade than in any comparable period since the 1920s. Among the issues raised by this influx, none is as controversial as its effect on the labor market opportunities of native-born workers. This paper presents new evidence on the effects of immigration, based on changes in the distributions of wages in 24 major cities during the 1980s. Although immigrant inflows are small relative to the populations of most cities, recent immigrants are a significant fraction of less-educated workers in many cities. We therefore concentrate on measuring the effects of immigration at the lower tail of the wage distribution. In particular, we ask whether recent declines in the real earnings of the least-skilled workers in the US economy are related to immigration. Our empirical analysis reveals large differences across cities in the relative growth rates of wages for low- and high-paid workers. Nevertheless, these differences bear little or no relation to the size of immigrant inflows. -from Authors"
"Kaplan G., Moll B., Violante G.L.",2018,American Economic Review,"We revisit the transmission mechanism from monetary policy to household consumption in a Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model. The model yields empirically realistic distributions of wealth and marginal propensities to consume because of two features: uninsurable income shocks and multiple assets with different degrees of liquidity and different returns. In this environment, the indirect effects of an unexpected cut in interest rates, which operate through a general equilibrium increase in labor demand, far outweigh direct effects such as intertemporal substitution. This finding is in stark contrast to small- and medium-scale Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) economies, where the substitution channel drives virtually all of the transmission from interest rates to consumption. Failure of Ricardian equivalence implies that, in HANK models, the fiscal reaction to the monetary expansion is a key determinant of the overall size of the macroeconomic response. © 2018 American Economic Association.

This paper studies China's rising domestic content in exports using firm- and customs transaction-level data. The approach embraces firm heterogeneity and hence reduces aggregation bias. The study finds that the substitution of domestic for imported materials by individual processing exporters caused China's domestic content in exports to increase from 65 to 70 percent in the period 2000-2007. Such substitution was induced by the country's trade and investment liberalization, which deepened its engagement in global value chains and led to a greater variety of domestic materials becoming available at lower prices."

Pre-industrial development is driven by increasing returns to specialization made possible by a growing population. Increasing specialization eventually activates a learning technology and initiates industrial growth, which carries the economy to a fully market-based balanced-growth path.

Interestingly, the concentrated market structures associated with flexibility may or may not be welfare-dominated by a regime in which monopolization is not allowed. -Authors"
Berry S.T.,1990,American Economic Review,"There is now widespread recognition that an airline's operation at a given airport greatly affects its competitive position on routes flown out of that airport. Airlines typically defend any competitive advantage as stemming from the lower costs and better service that are said to be generated by hub-and-spoke route systems. Airline critics typically respond that airlines gain market power by dominating individual airports. It also appears, however, that airlines gain other advantages from a large presence at an airport. Airlines with a large presence in a given city also gain advantages from frequent flyer plans and nonlinear travel agent commission schedules. If the bureaucratic and marketing advantages of airport presence are sufficient to prevent most attempts at entry, then incumbents may gain the ability to exercise traditional ""market power' by restricting output and driving up prices. This paper argues that both simple cost-reducing and naive market power stories are inappropriate for the airline industry. I present a model in which consumers are willing to pay a premium for the services of the dominant airline. This model has the advantage of treating oligopoly product differentiation in an explicit way, of treating price as an endogenous variable, and of allowing for airport presence to affect both costs and demand. -from Author"

Rosenzweig M.R.,1995,American Economic Review,"This paper briefly lays out a framework for investigating the circumstances under which schooling improves productivity in the market and in the household, based on the notion that schooling enhances information acquisition. It focuses on two channels by which schooling may enhance productivity: by improving access to information sources such as newspapers or instruction manuals, or by improving the ability to decipher new information, whether from external sources or from own experience. Evidence from prior studies based on micro estimates of agricultural and household technologies from both developed and low-income countries suggests that positive schooling returns exist where productive learning opportunities can be exploited. The paper also presents new evidence that suggests that schooling improves abilities to learn. The evidence thus suggests that schooling investments are not a universal panacea; reaping returns from such investments requires that the scope for productive learning be expanded via either technical innovation or changes in market and political regimes. -from Author"

The payoff to a venture-backed entrepreneur comprises a below-market salary and a share of the equity value of the company when it goes public or is acquired. We find that the typical venture-backed entrepreneur received an average of $5.8 million in exit cash. Almost three-quarters of entrepreneurs receive nothing at exit and a few receive over a billion dollars.

"Boisjoly J., Duncan G.J., Kremer M., Levy D.M., Eccles J.",2006,American Economic Review,"We find that white students randomly assigned African American roommates express more positive attitudes toward affirmative action and interacted more comfortably with minorities several years after college entry than white students assigned white roommates. One interpretation of our results is that students become more sympathetic to social policies directly related to the social groups to which their roommates belong, with supportive racial attitudes toward affirmative action being most closely associated with roommates' race. These findings are consistent with the evidence from social psychology that having close personal interactions with people from different groups leads to a greater understanding of, and empathy with, such people (Pettigrew and Tropp, 2000). Consistent with such a view, in related work (Boisjoly et al., 2003), we find that whites become less supportive of redistributive policies when they are assigned roommates from wealthy families. Although African Americans have lower high-school grades and standardized test scores in the university we study, we found no evidence to support the claim of some opponents of affirmative action that accepting more minority applicants than would be admitted under a purely test score-based process reinforces racial stereotypes and ultimately hurts minorities. The pattern of our results seems to indicate that roommates tend to affect attitudes (such as endorsement of affirmative action policies or being in favor of more diversity) and intermediate behaviors (such as having personal contact or being comfortable interacting with blacks), but have little or no effect on harder-to-change behavior (such as befriending or socializing with someone from another racial/ethnic group) and long-term goals (such as assigning greater importance to the imperative ""helping to promote racial understanding""). An important limitation of our study is the small numbers of whites assigned to black roommates. While standard errors reflect the small sample sizes, our study can be seen in some ways as a pilot study, and its conclusions should be viewed as suggestive rather than definitive. Moreover, we can examine only the effect on individuals of being randomly assigned a roommate; we cannot identify the general equilibrium effects of affirmative action, and we cannot determine if affirmative action leads to general changes in white attitudes other than those caused by increased exposure to African Americans. For example, we cannot rule out the possibility that the decision to adopt affirmative action policies at a university reinforces stereotypes among students who read about the policy in a newspaper. One topic for future research is to understand better the channels through which exposure to other groups affects attitudes. A variety of channels are plausible, from changes in preferences to Bayesian learning. People may simply become more empathetic to those with whom they spend more time, as argued by Casey B. Mulligan (1997). Alternatively, one could tell a purely informational story in which whites who believe discrimination is a thing of the past learn otherwise if they are assigned an African American roommate. Understanding the particular channels will be important for assessing whether working, studying, or sharing a neighborhood with African Americans is likely to have similar effects as being assigned an African American roommate."
Veldkamp L.L.,2006,American Economic Review,"Emerging equity markets witness occasional surges in prices (frenzies) and cross-market price dispersion (herds), accompanied by abundant media coverage. An information market complementarity can explain these anomalies. Because information has high fixed costs, high volume makes it inexpensive. Low prices induce investors to buy information that others buy. Given two identical assets, investors learn about one; abundant information reduces its payoff risk and raises its price. Transitions between low-information/low-asset-price and high-information/high-asset-price equilibria resemble frenzies.

Evans C.L.,2003,American Economic Review,"To address the economic significance of national border effects, this paper provides evidence on two fundamental questions: (1) Do large border effects arise because of high perceived-price wedges between foreign and domestic products, or because imports and domestic goods are very close substitutes?; and (2) If price wedges are important, do they reflect distortionary barriers to trade or do they arise from nondistortionary factors, such as differences in transactions costs or product characteristics?

Topel R.H.,1994,American Economic Review,"From 1972 to 1990, the US experienced the largest increase in wage inequality of any developed country. Various explanations have been offered, including changes in the relative demand for skill-intensive goods, international trade, immigration of less-skilled workers, and increased labor-force participation of women. Attempts to quantify the relative importance of these factors have not met with much success. This leaves skill-biased ""technical change' as the residual claimant that rationalizes the data. This paper uses regional differences in the evolution of wage inequality to provide new evidence on the determinants of relative wages. Using a model of factor demand in geographic markets, the author isolates contributions of: changing skill ratios in the labor force; increased participation of women; technical change; and changes in the industrial composition of labor demand. The data indicate that changing skill ratios and women's labor supply have affected the wages of low-skilled men. In the West, the data indicate that increased immigration of less-skilled Hispanic and Asian workers has adversely affected the wages of natives, causing a greater increase in inequality there than in any other region of the country. -from Author"

"Bajari P., Houghton S., Tadelis S.",2014,American Economic Review,"Procurement contracts are often renegotiated because of changes that are required after their execution. Using highway paving contracts we show that renegotiation imposes significant adaptation costs. Reduced form regressions suggest that bidders respond strategically to contractual incompleteness and that adaptation costs are an important determinant of their bids. A structural empirical model compares adaptation costs to bidder markups and shows that adaptation costs account for 7.5-14 percent of the winning bid. Markups from private information and market power, the focus of much of the auctions literature, are much smaller by comparison. Implications for government procurement are discussed."

Our methodology formalizes how the old mechanism is at least as manipulable as any other plausible mechanism, including the new one.

Weber R.A.,2006,American Economic Review,"Previous experiments using the minimum-effort coordination game reveal a striking regularity - large groups never coordinate efficiently. Given the frequency with which large real-world groups, such as firms, face similarly difficult coordination problems, this poses an important question: Why do we observe large, successfully coordinated groups in the real world when they are so difficult to create in the laboratory? This paper presents one reason. The experiments show that, even though efficient coordination does not occur in groups that start off large, efficiently coordinated large groups can be ""grown."" By starting with small groups that find it easier to coordinate, we can add entrants - who are aware of the group's history - to create efficiently coordinated large groups. This represents the first experimental demonstration of large groups tacitly coordinated at high levels of efficiency."

Lynch L.M.,1991,American Economic Review,"The purpose of this paper is to examine for young workers in their first years of work the determinants of leaving an employer. In particular, this paper focuses on the role of different types of training on the probability of leaving an employer. In previous work I have examined the impact of private-sector training on the determination of wages and wage growth of young workers and reached the following conclusions. First, formal company-provided on-the-job training appears to be highly firm-specific in the US and therefore it is not portable from employer to employer. Second, formal off-the-job training received from ""for-profit' proprietary institutions has little effect on the wages earned on the current job, but it does raise the expected wage in subsequent employment. Finally, there are important differences by race, gender, and education level in the probability of receiving different types of formal training and in the impact this training has on wages and wage growth. These findings have several implications for the impact of training on mobility.

We find that MCO bargaining restrains hospital prices significantly. The model demonstrates the potential impact of coinsurance rates, which allow MCOs to partly steer patients toward cheaper hospitals. We show that increasing patient coinsurance tenfold would reduce prices by 16 percent. We find that a proposed hospital acquisition in Northern Virginia that was challenged by the Federal Trade Commission would have significantly raised hospital prices. Remedies based on separate bargaining do not alleviate the price increases."

Using a simple choice model, we predict that transit riders are likely to be individuals who commute along routes with severe roadway delays.

Estimating a regression discontinuity design, we find that average highway delay increases 47 percent when transit service ceases. We find that the net benefits of transit systems appear to be much larger than previously believed. (JEL H76, J52, L92, R41)."
"Xiong W., Yu J.",2011,American Economic Review,"In 2005-2008, over a dozen put warrants traded in China went so deep out of the money that they were almost certain to expire worthless. Nonetheless, each warrant was traded more than three times each day at substantially inflated prices. This bubble is unique in that the underlying stock prices make warrant fundamentals publicly observable and that warrants have predetermined finite maturities. This sample allows us to examine a set of bubble theories. In particular, our analysis highlights the joint effects of short-sales constraints and heterogeneous beliefs in driving bubbles and confirms several key findings of the experimental bubble literature."

Firms simultaneously choose their number of competing units, which then engage in Cournot competition. While it is costly to form autonomous units, each firm does so in equilibrium, thus reducing firm profits and increasing social welfare relative to the case where firms cannot form competing units. With linear demand and costs, duopolists choose the socially optimal number of competing units; oligopolies with larger numbers of firms choose too many. The case of nonlinear demand is also examined."

Briefly, our conclusions are the following. In the absence of a competitive market for the purchase and sale of water rights, the appropriative doctrine leads to an inefficient use of water. Inefficiency arises among the users of a waterway; senior appropriators bear less risk than junior appropriators. -from Authors"

"Aguiar M., Bils M.",2015,American Economic Review,We revisit to what extent the increase in income inequality since 1980 was mirrored by consumption inequality. We do so by constructing an alternative measure of consumption expenditure using a demand system to correct for systematic measurement error in the Consumer Expenditure Survey. Our estimation exploits the relative expenditure of high- And low-income households on luxuries versus necessities. This double differencing corrects for measurement error that can vary over time by good and income. We find consumption inequality tracked income inequality much more closely than estimated by direct responses on expenditures.

This paper reconsiders the results of experiments by Rubinstein, Tversky, and others whose designs model nonneutral landscapes, in which subjects deviate systematically from equilibrium in response to them. Comparing alternative explanations theoretically and econometrically suggests that the deviations are well explained by a structural nonequilibrium model of initial responses based on ""level-k"" thinking, suitably adapted to nonneutral landscapes."

Character is desirable, and a voter's utility is a convex combination of standard policy preferences and her assessment of a candidate's character.

Benston G.J.,1985,American Economic Review,"The simple proposition that consumer-damaging collusion is more likely to occur when there are fewer competitors has given rise not only to legal restrictions of economic activity thought to restrict output, but also to an enormous amount of empirical work attempting to relate market concentration to the exercise of monopoly power.1 Most such studies measured market structure by an index of concentration (for example, four-firm concentration or Herfindahl) and performance by accounting profit (for example, net profit divided by assets) or price-cost margins (sales less direct costs divided by sales). From the positive, statistically significant correlations often found between greater concentration and profit (with other factors presumably accounted for), some researchers conclude that increases in concentration are anticompetitive and that concentration, therefore, is bad. The concentration-profits studies have been criticized essentially on two grounds. One is that the positive relationship is not indicative of collusive behavior. In particular, Oliver Williamson (1968), John McGee (1971), Harold Demsetz (1973, 1974), and Sam Peltzman (1977) point out that higher Profits could result from efficiencies experienced by large firms, which resulted both in greater market shares and high levels of concentration. Analytical arguments show that higher profits logically follow as much from lower costs that are associated with higher levels of concentration, as from collusion-determined higher prices. Some empirical evidence that supports this belief is presented by Demsetz, Peltzman, and Bradley Gale and Ben Branch (1982). However, their findings have been contested on the grounds that the data used are biased or inadequate, or that the researchers have not demonstrated that the observed higher-profits/greater-concentration relationship was caused by lower costs.2 The second criticism is that available data provide an inadequate basis for such conclusions. The concentration numbers are based, usually, on industries defined by the Commerce Department's Standard Industrial Classifications (SIC). The SIC definitions tend to be supply (production) rather than demand determined, include nonhomogeneous products, and exclude sales of similar products that are included in different SIC groups or are imported. The profit data are taken from accounting reports that provide poor measures of economic values. Weiss (1974) describes many of these problems. However, he does not believe that these shortcomings invalidate the studies. As Weiss (1979) concludes: I argued that the crudeness of the concentration data, the increasing diversification of firms, and many distortions in accounting profits all bias the observed relationship between concentration and profits towards zero. Because of these biases, I argued that the effect [of a significant positive relationship] was probably understated when observed, and that it might well have been present when it was not detected."

Allcott H.,2011,American Economic Review,"This paper presents three initial stylized facts from the Vehicle Ownership and Alternatives Survey (VOAS), a nationally representative survey that elicits consumers' beliefs about gasoline prices and the relative energy costs of autos with different fuel economy ratings. First, American consumers devote little attention to fuel costs when purchasing autos. Second, consistent with a cognitive bias called ""MPG Illusion,"" consumers underestimate the fuel cost differences between low-MPG vehicles and overestimate the differences between high-MPG vehicles. Third, Americans' mean and median expected future gas prices were above current prices and predictions of the futures market at the time of the survey. Although it is often argued that misperceived energy costs justify policies to encourage the sale of energy efficient durable goods, these results show that misperceptions and expectations that differ from market information could either increase or decrease energy efficiency. © 2011 AEA.

The data provide new insight into the consumption behavior of the poor, who act as though maximizing utility subject to subsistence concerns.

Neary J.P.,1978,American Economic Review,"This paper has examined the implications for the theory of factor-market distortions of a class of dynamic adjustment mechanisms, of which the short-run capital specificity assumption is an interesting special case. It was shown that the existing literature requires modification in a number of respects: 1) A small open econonmy (i.e., an economy facing fixed commodity prices) can never be in a stable unspecialized equilibrium where one sector is relatively labor intensive in physical terms, but relatively capital intensive in value terms. This conclusion rules out a number of paradoxical outcomes (such as a ""perverse"" price-output response) which have received a great deal of attention in the literature on factor-market distortions. 2) A closed economy, or an open economy which has some influence over its terms of trade, can be in a stable unspecialized equilibrium where the rankings of the two sectors by physical and value factor intensities do not correspond. The condition for such an equilibrium to be stable is that Jones' ""aggregate elasticity of substitution"" be positive. This stability condition is important since it permits us to sign unambiguously a great many comparative static results of the two-sector model; and in this case too, many paradoxical outcomes may be ruled out. 3) Finally, contrary to Jones (1971a), when the rankings of the two sectors by physical and value factor intensities differ, the condition for the economy to be in stable equilibrium implies that the intersection of the demand schedule and the long-run supply schedule must exhibit Walrasian instability. One final qualification to the conclusions of this paper must be noted. It involves what might be called the Ambiguity of the Correspondence Principle: while the assumption of stability is a powerful tool in deducing comparative static results, it may yield different results depending on which particular disequilibrium adjustment mechanism is assumed. Thus all of the conclusions given above are conditional on the particular class of adjustment mechanisms which has been examined. However, while it is not difficult to devise alternative mechanisms, there is no reason to believe that they would imply different stability conditions.12 Clearly, it would be desirable to develop still more complicated adjustment mechanisms, insofar as the objective is to model the actual process of adjustment towards long-run equilibrium in real world economies.13 But for the present it seems reasonable to accept the conclusions derived from the adjustment mechanisms studied in this paper, with their attractive implication that the long-run predictions of the theory of factor-market distortions are much more consistent with simple economic intuition than has been thought."

"Sargent T., Williams N., Zha T.",2006,American Economic Review,"We use a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the parameters of a ""true"" data-generating mechanism and those of a sequence of approximating models that a monetary authority uses to guide its decisions. Gaps between a true expectational Phillips curve and the monetary authority's approximating nonexpectational Phillips curve models unleash inflation that a monetary authority that knows the true model would avoid. A sequence of dynamic programming problems implies that the monetary authority's inflation target evolves as its estimated Phillips curve moves. Our estimates attribute the rise and fall of post-WWII inflation in the United States to an intricate interaction between the monetary authority's beliefs and economic shocks. Shocks in the 1970s made the monetary authority perceive a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment which ignited big inflation. The monetary authority's beliefs about the Phillips curve changed in ways that account for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker's conquest of U.S."

We discuss properties of such models when a Cournot equilibrium occurs at the second stage. Aggregate production costs strictly decline with no change in gross revenue or gross consumer surplus if the prior actions strictly increase the variance of marginal costs without changing the marginal-cost sum. Therefore, unless the cost of inducing second-stage asymmetry more than offsets this reduction in production costs, the private and social optima are asymmetric."

Under some parameter restrictions, the trade elasticity is constant and is a sufficient statistic for welfare, along with the domestic trade share. However, even small deviations from these restrictions imply that trade elasticities are variable and differ across markets and levels of trade costs. In this more general setting, the domestic trade share and endogenous trade elasticity are no longer sufficient statistics for welfare.

These correlations are not found in the tropics outside of Africa, where the fly does not exist.

The focus of this article is on some important, unsettled problems of the commons. Within the realm of natural resources, there are special challenges associated with renewable resources, which are frequently characterized by open-access. An important example is the degradation of openaccess fisheries. Critical commons problems are also associated with environmental quality.

"DellaVigna S., Pollet J.M.",2007,American Economic Review,"How do investors respond to predictable shifts in profitability? We consider how demographic shifts affect profits and returns across industries. Cohort size fluctuations produce forecastable demand changes for age-sensitive sectors, such as toys, bicycles, beer, life insurance, and nursing homes. These demand changes are predictable once a specific cohort is born. We use lagged consumption and demographic data to forecast future consumption demand growth induced by changes in age structure. We find that demand forecasts predict profitability by industry. Moreover, forecast demand changes five to ten years in the future predict annual industry stock returns. One additional percentage point of annualized demand growth due to demographics predicts a 5 to 10 percentage point increase in annual abnormal industry stock returns. However, forecasted demand changes over shorter horizons do not predict stock returns. A trading strategy exploiting demographic information earns an annualized risk-adjusted return of approximately 6 percent. We present a model of inattention to information about the distant future that is consistent with the findings. We also discuss alternative explanations, including omitted risk-based factors."

Our quantitative analysis shows that, abstracting from the capital crowding-out effect, the introduction of social security represents a Pareto-improving reform, even when the economy is dynamically efficient. However, the severity of the crowding-out effect in general equilibrium tends to overturn these gains."
Devine T.J.,1994,American Economic Review,"A steady increase in the number of females choosing to work for themselves, instead of someone else, represents one of the more striking recent trends in the US labor market. This trend raises an obvious question, namely, what was happening to female earnings opportunities in self-employment, relative to earnings opportunities in wage-and-salary employment? Findings presented in this paper indicate the following: self-employment increased more for females who faced increasing potential earnings in wage-and-salary employment, suggesting that returns to skill were increasing by even more in self-employment; increasing relative returns to skill may explain at least part of the recent rise in female self-employment; there is an absence of a sharp difference in self-employment rates between women in the top and middle segments of the skill distribution: women with relatively low skill levels who faced declining real wages in wage-and-salary employment did not turn to self-employment in the same proportions as women with higher skill levels. Results presented here suggest that the recent rise in female self-employment may have added to the increasing earnings inequality that has been documented previously for females in wage-and-salary employment, a finding that is clearly worth further investigation. -from Author"

The primary result is that the personal exemption has a positive and significant effect on the national birthrate, and this result is robust to a variety of specifications. Although the elasticity of the birthrate with respect to the exemption is not large, it appears that the US can influence to a degree the fertility decisions of its citizens through deliberate changes in tax policies.

Without this assumption, foreign asset trade is possible even in the absence of default penalties. This result suggests a broader perspective regarding the origins of sovereign risk and its remedies. Sovereign risk affects foreign asset trade only if default penalties are insufficient and secondary markets work imperfectly.

To account for nonrandom sorting of workers into firms with different turnover rates and for selective job mobility, we use changes over time in firm- and age-specific labor demand as an instrument for displacement. We find that wage losses of young job losers are initially 15 percent, but drop to zero within five years. Only workers leaving very large establishments suffer persistent losses. A comparison of estimators implies that initial sorting, negative selection, and voluntary job mobility biases ordinary least squares estimates toward finding permanent negative effects of early displacements."
"Ivković Z., Poterba J., Weisbenner S.",2005,American Economic Review,"We analyze stock trades made by individuals holding stock in both taxable and tax-deferred accounts. By comparing trades across these two types of accounts, we uncover a capital gains lock-in effect in taxable accounts. The lock-in effect is more pronounced for large stock transactions and for stocks held for at least 12 months. Over shorter horizons, the disposition effect outweighs the lock-in effect. Comparison of loss realizations in taxable and tax-deferred accounts yields evidence of tax-loss selling throughout the year. Effective accrual tax rates for stocks that experience substantial appreciation are substantially below the statutory tax rate on long-term gains."
"Knoll K., Schularick M., Steger T.",2017,American Economic Review,"How have house prices evolved over the long run? This paper presents annual house prices for 14 advanced economies since 1870. We show that real house prices stayed constant from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, but rose strongly and with substantial cross-country variation in the second half of the twentieth century. Land prices, not replacement costs, are the key to understanding the trajectory of house prices. Rising land prices explain about 80 percent of the global house price boom that has taken place since World War II. Our findings have implications for the evolution of wealthto- income ratios, the growth effects of agglomeration, and the price elasticity of housing supply."
"Kearney M.S., Levine P.B.",2015,American Economic Review,This paper explores the impact of the introduction of the widely viewed MTV reality show 16 and Pregnant on teen childbearing. Our main analysis relates geographic variation in changes in teen childbearing rates to viewership of the show. We implement an instrumental variables (IV) strategy using local area MTV ratings data from a pre-period to predict local area 16 and Pregnant ratings. The results imply that this show led to a 4.3 percent reduction in teen births. An examination of Google Trends and Twitter data suggest that the show led to increased interest in contraceptive use and abortion.
"Brown J., Duggan M., Kuziemko I., Woolston W.",2014,American Economic Review,"To combat adverse selection, governments increasingly base payments to health plans and providers on enrollees' scores from risk-adjustment formulae. In 2004, Medicare began to risk-adjust capitation payments to private Medicare Advantage (MA) plans to reduce selection-driven overpayments. But because the variance of medical costs increases with the predicted mean, incentivizing enrollment of individuals with higher scores can increase the scope for enrolling ""overpriced"" individuals with costs significantly below the formula's prediction. Indeed, after risk adjustment, MA plans enrolled individuals with higher scores but lower costs conditional on their score. We find no evidence that overpayments were on net reduced. © 2014, American Economic Association. All rights reserved."

We find a considerably weaker relationship between one's insurance decisions and 401(k) asset allocation, although this relationship appears larger for more ""financially sophisticated"" individuals.

The experimental results are that risk-seeking behavior is observed in many people and appears in markets as predicted. In addition, market behavior is consistent with answers to hypothetical questionnaires. Contrary to prospect theory, risk seeking seems to diminish with experience; preferences in the market setting are not labile; and risk-seeking preferences are not simply a result of framing effects."

We find that a large share of the expected gains from the technology comes from crowding in of other investments. Therefore, improved technologies that reduce risk by protecting production in bad years have the potential to increase agricultural productivity in normal years."

We measure the extent to which these two conditions are satisfied in Taiwanese producer-level data. Versions of our model consistent with the Taiwanese data predict that opening up to trade strongly increases competition and reduces markup distortions by up to one-half, thus significantly reducing productivity losses due to misallocation."

This bias is measured by a decision maker's risk/ reward ratio from a war compared to that of the country at large. If there is no political bias, then there are mutually acceptable transfers from one country to the other that will avoid a war in the presence of commitment or enforceability of peace treaties. There are cases with a strong enough bias on the part of one or both countries where war cannot be prevented by any transfer payments. Our results shed some new light on the uneven contender paradox and the interpretation of the ""democratic peace.""

"Missale A., Blanchard O.J.",1994,American Economic Review,"For most OECD countries over the last 30 yr, there appears to have been little relation between the level of debt and its maturity. One set of countries stands in clear exception to this general statement, where the increase in debt has been associated with a sharp reduction in maturity. The paper provides an explanation for these two sets of facts. In Section I, the authors look at debt and maturity for the three OECD countries that have reached high levels of debt: Italy, Belgium, and Ireland. For each, the authors construct an effective maturity series. The strong inverse relation between effective maturity and the debt-GDP ratio is documented. In Section II, a simple model based on the now standard idea of a reputation equilibrium is developed. The maximum maturity consistent with a credible no-inflation pledge will decrease with the level of debt. In Section III, a number of extensions to the model is discussed. The initial model explains how maturity decreases with the level of debt but generates a constant level of debt in equilibrium. It is argued that, once the other motives explored in the literature are taken into account, maximum maturity is likely to bind only at high levels of debt. -from Authors"

Our randomized treatment shows pessimistic information about mobility and increases support for redistribution, mostly for “equality of opportunity” policies. We find strong political polarization. Left-wing respondents are more pessimistic about mobility: their preferences for redistribution are correlated with their mobility perceptions; and they support more redistribution after seeing pessimistic information. None of this is true for right-wing respondents, possibly because they see the government as a “problem” and not as the “solution”."

Our answer to the title question is: ""yes."" We impose a large increase in liquidity and dividend uncertainty to shock the environment of experienced subjects who have converged to equilibrium, and this treatment rekindles a bubble. However, in replications of that same challenging environment across three experience levels, we discover that the environment yields a rare residual tendency to bubble even in the third experience session. Therefore, a caveat must be placed on the effect of twice-experienced subjects in asset markets: in order for price bubbles to be extinguished, the environment in which the participants engage in exchange must be stationary and bounded by a range of parameters. Experience, including possible ""error"" elimination, is not robust to major new environment changes in determining the characteristics of a price bubble."

This effect is dominated by conventional effects, so that anticipated bargaining benefits the small country on balance, if there is sufficient: (i) dissimilarity between the economies, and (ii) substitutability between goods."

"Auffhammer M., Kellogg R.",2011,American Economic Review,"This paper examines whether US gasoline content regulations, which impose substantial costs on consumers, have successfully reduced ozone pollution. We take advantage of spatial and temporal variation in the regulations' implementation to show that federal gasoline standards, which allow refiners flexibility in choosing a compliance mechanism, did not improve air quality. This outcome occurred because minimizing the cost of compliance does not reduce emissions of those compounds most prone to forming ozone. In California, however, we find that precisely targeted, inflexible regulations requiring the removal of particularly harmful compounds significantly improved air quality."

We exploit this variation to show that the workforce age composition has a large and significant effect on cyclical volatility.

"Diamond D.W., Rajan R.G.",2006,American Economic Review,"We examine the role of banks in the transmission of monetary policy. In economies where banks use real demand deposits to finance their lending, fluctuations in the timing of production can force banks to scramble for real liquidity, or even fail, which can greatly affect lending and aggregate output. The adverse effect on output can be reduced if banks finance with nominal deposits. Nominal deposits also open a ""financial liquidity© channel for monetary policy to affect real activity. The banking system may be better off, however, issuing real deposits (e.g., foreign exchange denominated) under some circumstances."

In a model where inventories are productive for sales, both the markup of price over marginal cost and expected changes in marginal cost are key determinants of that ratio. This paper argues that costly variation in factor utilization gives rise to countercyclical markups in production-to-stock manufacturing industries. The markup turns out to be more important than intertemporal substitution in explaining the behavior of inventory-sales ratios."

Cyclical contractions involve declines in real interest rates, increases in credit rationing, and withdrawals of savings from banks. For some configurations of parameters all equilibria display cyclical fluctuations.

Moreover, because the defaulting states were part of a large and economically integrated nation, creditors could not enforce payment by imposing military or trade sanctions. In spite of the lack of sanctions, however, most states eventually repaid in full. It appears that the states repaid in order to maintain access to capital markets, much as in reputational models of sovereign debt."

In contrast to canonical export models where firm profits are additively separable across destination markets, global sourcing decisions naturally interact through the firm's cost function. We show that, under an empirically relevant condition, selection into importing exhibits complementarities across source markets. We exploit these complementarities to solve the firm's problem and estimate the model. Comparing counterfactual predictions to reduced-form evidence highlights the importance of interdependencies in firms' sourcing decisions across markets, which generate heterogeneous domestic sourcing responses to trade shocks."

"Muralidharan K., Niehaus P., Sukhtankar S.",2016,American Economic Review,"Antipoverty programs in developing countries are often difficult to implement; in particular, many governments lack the capacity to deliver payments securely to targeted beneficiaries. We evaluate the impact of biometrically authenticated payments infrastructure (""Smartcards"") on beneficiaries of employment (NREGS) and pension (SSP) programs in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, using a large-scale experiment that randomized the rollout of Smartcards over 157 subdistricts and 19 million people. We find that, while incompletely implemented, the new system delivered a faster, more predictable, and less corrupt NREGS payments process without adversely affecting program access. For each of these outcomes, treatment group distributions first-order stochastically dominated those of the control group. The investment was cost-effective, as time savings to NREGS beneficiaries alone were equal to the cost of the intervention, and there was also a significant reduction in the ""leakage"" of funds between the government and beneficiaries in both NREGS and SSP programs. Beneficiaries overwhelmingly preferred the new system for both programs. Overall, our results suggest that investing in secure payments infrastructure can significantly enhance ""state capacity"" to implement welfare programs in developing countries."

Levy G.,2007,American Economic Review,"In this paper I analyze the effect of transparency on decision making in committees. I focus on committees whose members are motivated by career concerns. The main result is that when the decision-making process is secretive (when individual votes are not revealed to the public), committee members comply with preexisting biases. For example, if the voting rule demands a supermajority to accept a reform, individuals vote more often against reforms. Transparent committees are therefore more likely to accept reforms. I also find that coupled with the right voting rule, a secretive procedure may induce better decisions than a transparent one."

Lower-income countries are more prone to such demand-based financial crises.

Nordhaus W.D.,1991,American Economic Review,"Over the last decade, scientists have studied extensively the greenhouse effect, which holds that the accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) is expected to produce global warming and other significant climatic changes over the next century. The present study presents an economic approach for analyzing policies to slow climate change. In weighing climate change policies, the prospects for global warming and the linkage between human activities and the emissions of GHGs form a key building block. I translate each GHG into its ""CO2 equivalent' in total warming potential. Current emissions are about 8 billion tons of CO2 equivalent per year (carbon weight). On the basis of climate models and climate history, scientists expect that a doubling of CO2 will in equilibrium lead to an increase in the global mean surface temperature of 1 to 5°C, an increase in precipitation and evaporation, a small rise in sea level, and a number of other more uncertain effects. -from Author"

The model assumes risk-neutrality and limited liability, and no other functional form assumptions. Very generally, the optimal contract is linear.

Vertical mergers also result in an opposing punishment effect: integrated firms typically make more profit in the punishment phase than unintegrated upstream firms. The net result of these effects in an unintegrated industry is to facilitate upstream collusion. We provide conditions under which further vertical integration also facilitates collusion.

The central point of this article is that appropriative water rights and irrigation districts that emerged in the American West in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in response to aridity to facilitate agricultural water delivery, use, and trade raise the transaction costs today of water markets. These markets are vital for smooth reallocation of water to higher-valued uses elsewhere in the economy and for flexible response to greater hydrological uncertainty.

"Bereby-Meyer Y., Roth A.E.",2006,American Economic Review,"In an experiment, players' ability to learn to cooperate in the repeated prisoner's dilemma was substantially diminished when the payoffs were noisy, even though players could monitor one another's past actions perfectly. In contrast, in one-time play against a succession of opponents, noisy payoffs increased cooperation, by slowing the rate at which cooperation decays. These observations are consistent with the robust observation from the psychology literature that partial reinforcement (adding randomness to the link between an action and its consequences while holding expected payoffs constant) slows learning. This effect is magnified in the repeated game: when others are slow to learn to cooperate, the benefits of cooperation are reduced, which further hampers cooperation. These results show that a small change in the payoff environment, which changes the speed of individual learning, can have a large effect on collective behavior. And they show that there may be interesting comparative dynamics that can be derived from careful attention to the fact that at least some economic behavior is learned from experience."

"Moscarini G., Postel-Vinay F.",2012,American Economic Review,"We document a negative correlation, at business cycle frequencies, between the net job creation rate of large employers and the level of aggregate unemployment that is much stronger than for small employers. The differential growth rate of employment between initially large and small employers has an unconditional correlation of -0.5 with the unemployment rate, and varies by about 5 percent over the business cycle. We exploit several datasets from the United States, Denmark, and France, both repeated cross sections and job flows with employer longitudinal information, spanning the last four decades and several business cycles. We discuss implications for theories of factor demand."
Shimer R.,2007,American Economic Review,"This paper develops a dynamic model of mismatch. Workers and jobs are randomly allocated to labor markets. Each market clears, but some have excess (unemployed) workers and some have excess (vacant) jobs. As workers and jobs switch markets, unemployed workers find vacancies and employed workers become unemployed. The model is quantitatively consistent with the business cycle frequency comovement of unemployment, vacancies, and the job finding rate and explains much of these variables' volatility. It can also address cyclicality in the separation rate into unemployment and duration dependence in the job finding rate. The results are robust to some nonrandom mobility."
"Butler D.J., Loomes G.C.",2007,American Economic Review,"Many individuals' choices and valuations involve a degree of uncertainty/imprecision. This paper reports an experiment designed to obtain some measure of imprecision and to examine the extent to which it can explain preference reversals of two opposite forms, one of which appears not to have been reported previously. The model of imprecision we examine not only predicts both patterns but also provides an account of earlier results that are otherwise not well explained. The results suggest that any successful descriptive theory of choice and valuation will need to allow in some way for the imprecision surrounding people's decisions."
Battaglini M.,2005,American Economic Review,"To study how a firm can capitalize on a long-term customer relationship, we characterize the optimal contract between a monopolist and a consumer whose preferences follow a Markov process. The optimal contract is nonstationary and has infinite memory, but is described by a simple state variable. Under general conditions, supply converges to the efficient level for any degree of persistence of the types and along any history, though convergence is history-dependent. In contrast, as with constant types, the optimal contract can be renegotiation-proof, even with highly persistent types. These properties provide insights into the optimal ownership structure of the production technology."
"Dobbie W., Goldin J., Yang C.S.",2018,American Economic Review,"Over 20 percent of prison and jail inmates in the United States are currently awaiting trial, but little is known about the impact of pretrial detention on defendants. This paper uses the detention tendencies of quasi-randomly assigned bail judges to estimate the causal effects of pretrial detention on subsequent defendant outcomes. Using data from administrative court and tax records, we find that pretrial detention significantly increases the probability of conviction, primarily through an increase in guilty pleas. Pretrial detention has no net effect on future crime, but decreases formal sector employment and the receipt of employment- and tax-related government benefits. These results are consistent with (i) pretrial detention weakening defendants’ bargaining positions during plea negotiations and (ii) a criminal conviction lowering defendants’ prospects in the formal labor market."

"Glimcher P.W., Kable J., Louie K.",2007,American Economic Review,"A small group of scholars committed to the revealed preference approach have recently begun to propose that economics must search for additional observables that can be used to test and examine existing models. Andrew Caplin and Mark Dean (2007), for example, have proposed that the axiomatic reasoning that has characterized the study of revealed preference can be extended to the study of neurobiological variables that actually govern choice behavior. This seems to us an incredibly powerful new direction that could revolutionize both economics and neuroscience. Neurobiologists interested in the algorithmic structure of the brain have begun to reveal many of the proximal mechanisms by which choice is produced. Algorithmic mechanisms for preference ordering, stochastic choice, and even value construction have all been identified in recent years. Given these new observations, it seems only natural to ask whether these already existing observables can be used to examine, even falsify, existing revealed preference-based theories of choice. At the moment, neuroeconomists seem to be dividing into two camps. The first of these camps has used neurobiological data to argue against a revealed preference analyses of choice (Colin Camerer, Loewenstein, and Drazen Prelec 2005). Here, we argue for a different road. We believe that the revealed preference approach brings an unparalleled power to the study of choice. Contemporary neurobiology brings a similar power to the study of mechanism. It is the combination of these two tried and tested approaches that we believe can revolutionize both disciplines."

"Hassler J., Rodríguez Mora J.V.",2000,American Economic Review,"We develop a model where the allocation of human resources, intergenerational social mobility, and technological growth are jointly determined. High growth endogenously increases the equilibrium return to innate cognitive ability and makes the allocation of individuals depend more on innate ability and less on social background. Individuals with a higher level of innate cognitive ability can deal better with less known, but more productive, technologies and thus choose a higher rate of technological growth. A social allocation based on innate ability and high growth will thus reinforce each other, implying the possibility of multiple endogenous growth equilibria. (JEL J62, O1)."
Chiu Y.S.,1998,American Economic Review,"This paper reexamines the effect of asset ownership on investment decisions for a joint relationship in the absence of contracts on investment levels. It obtains some results which contradict findings by Grossman, Hart, and Moore. In particular, it finds that the loss of ownership of an asset may increase the asset loser's investment incentive. The difference between this paper and those authors' papers stems from the different interpretations of the roles of the threat point and outside options in bargaining. This paper also clarifies the role of relationship-specific investments as a cause of integration."

"Kamien M.I., Schwartz N.L.",1978,American Economic Review,"We have analyzed the problem of a firm contemplating new product development. It may anticipate higher profit from an im- proved product or fear loss of profits were its current product to be displaced by a superior rival product. If, however, a rival product is introduced prior to the firm's own new product, the defense will be un- successful and the firm will also lose the re- sources devoted to development. We sought an R&D program to maximize the present expected value of profits, as- suming that the firm must finance develop- ment entirely from its cash reserves and in- ternally generated protits. A number of interesting findings emerge. First, a cash constraint will not impede development at all for a large class of R&D projects by established firms, namely those that no more than, say, double the expected gross profits. For such R&D projects, develop- ment can be readily financed from current profits and the cash constraint has no effect. Second, even when the cash constraint is binding, it is never optimal for R&D spend- ing to just match cash receipts for more than a moment; the cash balance will be single-peaked, becoming zero only upon project completion. Third, in case of no in- novational rivalry, the criterion for a project to be worthwhile is independent of the fi- nancial requirements of the project and of the financial resources of the firm. No project would be bypassed because of financial limitations. The only possible ef- fect of the cash constraint in this case is to reduce the development pace and prolong the development period. If there may be in- novational rivals, an active cash constraint will not only reduce the development pace and prolong the development period of ac- cepted projects, but could also reduce the acceptability of potential R&D projects. Finally, development was shown to be hastened by a large gross reward and a small required effort, as was expected. In addition, profit from the current product plays two roles; it contributes toward the available cash to finance new product de- velopment, but also reduces the attractive- ness of introducing a new product that re- places it. The net impact depends on whether the cash constraint is active. So long as financing is not an active constraint, larger current profits retard new product develop- ment through their effect on reducing the net gain from innovation. In contrast, if the cash constraint is active, then the role of current profits in providing cash dominates and incremental current profits hasten new product development."

Data on over 168,000 children show that, relative to Africa, India's height disadvantage increases sharply with birth order. We posit that India's steep birth order gradient is due to favoritism toward eldest sons, which affects parents' fertility decisions and resource allocation across children. We show that, within India, the gradient is steeper for high-son-preference regions and religions. The gradient also varies with sibling gender as predicted. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that India's steeper birth order gradient can explain over one-half of the India-Africa gap in average child height."
"Kamada Y., Kojima F.",2015,American Economic Review,"Many real matching markets are subject to distributional constraints.

Motivated by these markets, we study design of matching mechanisms under distributional constraints. We show that existing matching mechanisms suffer from inefficiency and instability, and propose a mechanism that is better in terms of efficiency, stability, and incentives while respecting the distributional constraints."

These increases are higher than for 1992, suggesting lags in the returns to adoption, and are highly skewed across hauls.

"Just R.E., Antle J.M.",1990,American Economic Review,"Agricultural policy has a well-documented impact on farmers' production decisions, which may in turn affect the environment. There is a public perception that existing agricultural policies are linked to agricultural pollution, as exemplified by the conclusions of the recent National Research Council report, Alternative Agriculture (1989). This paper develops a conceptual framework that can be used to analyze the interactions between agricultural and environmental policies and pollution. It integrates physical and economic models at a disaggregate level necessary to capture the heterogeneity of the physical environment and the economic behavior of farmers. Combining the different policy instruments with the microeconomic heterogeneity, we find that existing agricultural and environmental policies can have either positive or negative effects of nonpoint source pollution; to infer an aggregate effect requires data that do not currently exist. Our framework provides a basis for empirical investigations of these effects, given adequate data. -from Authors"
"Kunreuther H., Easterling D.",1990,American Economic Review,"Ever since Marshall introduced the notion of consumer surplus into the literature as a measure of well-being, economists have been interested in determining the amount of compensation required to leave individuals indifferent between the status quo and a new situation where less of a commodity can be consumed. The analysis is less applicable for dealing with environmental resources where elements of risk are involved, or there exist public good features that make it difficult to estimate people's values for different amenities. This paper investigates the question of the appropriate role that providing benefits to a host community can play in improving the chances of siting a facility that is perceived to be potentially hazardous. In Section I, we develop a simple two-period expected utility model to explain preferences for benefit packages. The empirical analysis examining the predictive power of this model will be related to the following problem of current interest. The US Congress is attempting to locate a site for storing high-level radioactive waste from commercial nuclear power plants in the United States. An underground repository is to be constructed for the purpose of permanently storing nuclear waste shipped in casks from power plants around the country. Based on the results of a telephone survey of residents of Nevada regarding their attitudes toward a high-level nuclear waste repository, we suggest ways that the expected utility model might be modified to take into account behavioral factors that are not normally considered part of individual models of choice under uncertainty. -from Authors"

The financing firm obtains the option to terminate the agreement and, in case of termination, broad property rights.

This association is quantitatively robust to conditioning on correlates of unobserved constraints, preferences, and beliefs. Consistency with utility maximization under laboratory conditions thus captures decision-making ability that applies across domains and influences important real-world outcomes."
"Bundorf M.K., Levin J., Mahoney N.",2012,American Economic Review,"Premiums in health insurance markets frequently do not reflect individual differences in costs, either because consumers have private information or because prices are not risk rated. This creates inefficiencies when consumers self-select into plans. We develop a simple econometric model to study this problem and estimate it using data on small employers. We find a welfare loss of 2-11 percent of coverage costs compared to what is feasible with risk rating. Only about one-quarter of this is due to inefficiently chosen uniform contribution levels. We also investigate the reclassification risk created by risk rating individual incremental premiums, finding only a modest welfare cost. Copyright © 2012 by the American Economic Association."
Yi K.-M.,2010,American Economic Review,"A large empirical literature finds that there is too little international trade and too much intranational trade to be rationalized by observed international trade costs, such as tariffs and transport costs. This paper investigates whether a model in which the nature of production can change in response to trade costs-a framework with multistage production-can better explain the home bias in trade. The calibrated model can explain about two-fifths of the Canada border effect, about two-and-one-half times that of a model with one production stage. The model also explains a significant fraction of Canada-US ""back-and-forth,"" or vertical specialization, trade."
Nuxoll D.A.,1994,American Economic Review,"This paper examines the International Comparison Program (ICP) and the Penn World Tables (PWT), which are based on the ICP. The Penn World Tables are the data most widely used in empirical studies of international differences in economic growth. Both the ICP and PWT use ""international prices' to adjust for differences in the purchasing power of currencies. These prices most closely resemble Hungarian prices. Using such prices tends to produce time series with lower growth rates than those in the national accounts for countries less developed than Hungary; conversely, the growth rates would be higher for countries more developed than Hungary. The growth rates of poorer countries are not systematically lower in the Penn World Tables. The paper examines why the growth rates are not disorted and makes some specific recommendations for data construction and use. -from Author"
"Honig M., Filer R.K.",1993,American Economic Review,"Homelessness in America has become a major policy concern in recent years. This papers uses estimates by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) of the homeless population in a cross-section of metropolitan areas in 1984 to present reduced-form findings as a first attempt to measure the underlying causes of homelessness. The findings indicate that homelessness has multiple causes. It has roots in housing markets, labor markets, and public policies regarding the treatment of the mentally ill and the low-income population. Although replication of this study using data from the 1990 census should be fruitful, the results reported above are suggestive and provide a framework for discussions of policies to reduce homelessness. -from Authors"
Carlton D.W.,1978,American Economic Review,"This paper has examined the behavior of markets characterized by price inflexibility, demand uncertainty, and production lags. It appears that many markets in the private, regulated, and government sectors are better described by the model examined here than by the traditional supply and demand model. Examples of markets described by the models of this paper include transportation, manufacturing, retailing, electric utilities, restaurants, hotels, and public parks. Natural features of the markets studied here are that buyers and sellers will always have some probability of being unable to buy or sell all they want of the good. Supply will not in general equal demand. Price will exceed average production cost of the goods that are sold. It was possible to prove that as the size of the market increased, the equilibrium under uncertainty converged percentage-wise to that under certainty. Numerical calculations suggested that the customer per firm ratio might have to be unrealistically large before close convergence occurred. The social welfare implications of markets under uncertainty differ from those under certainty. In the special case where expected consumer surplus reflects consumer's preferences, a competitive equilibrium is optimal. This result contrasts with previous results in the literature. In general though, the competitive equilibrium is not socially optimal, and the conditions under which subsidization would occur were derived. The models examined here are rich in their implications. Demand uncertainty imposes costs on a firm in the form of potential idle capacity. Firms have an incentive to stabilize their random demand by finding ""loyal"" customers. Such loyal customers get a price discount because they enable a firm to better plan its production. In terms of the model, any customer willing to order in advance need pay only c for the product. Customers not willing to order in advance pay a higher price for the privilege of only buying occasionally. Newspaper subscriptions illustrate this point nicely. Coupons in packages are another example where random buyers pay a higher price than repeat buyers. Special favors and discounts for steady customers provide a final important example. When the customers are interpreted as firms purchasing inputs, we obtain a model where firms might consider vertically integrating (or signing long-term contracts) to better assure themselves of supply at a lower than market price. Any firm with certain demand could supply its own needs at a price below the market price. In the markets under study, externalities can occur when supplying firms cannot distinguish among customers with differing demand uncertainties. Firms might vertically integrate to escape paying for the costs that someone else's uncertainty imposes on the market. (See the author, 1976, for an examination of vertical integration.) This paper emphasizes that the behavior of markets characterized by price inflexibility, demand uncertainty, and production lags differs in important respects from that of traditional deterministic markets. Because of the prevalence of these ""nontraditional"" markets in the economy, their further study definitely seems warranted."

We use retail store-level multiproduct pricing data to learn about price dynamics. We find that, while the timing of a product's price changes is staggered across stores selling the same product, the timing of the price changes of different products sold within the same store is highly synchronized. This finding validates the usual assumption that decisions are staggered across price-setters and suggests that price rigidity is due mostly to ""mechanical"" reasons and not to informational asymmetries."
"Banerjee A.V., Newman A.F.",1994,American Economic Review,"It is not clear that the evident behavioral differences between the poor and everyone else - the poor save less and are less likely to become entrepreneurs, for example - arise from differences in preferences and abilities or instead from differences in the economic environment. An insight from the recent literature on incentives is that a similar case can be made without reference to any distinctive behaviour traits of the poor; it relies simply on the fact that the poor are closer to the lower bound on their utility than the rest of the population. Consequently, threats of punishment work less well against the poor than against others: the poor behave as if they have nothing to lose. The poor then find it harder than everyone else to borrow and insure, and that in turn makes them behave differently. The authors study this point in the context of an investment problem. The following sections use the idea to develop models of poverty traps. -from Authors"
Blanchard O.,2019,American Economic Review,"This lecture focuses on the costs of public debt when safe interest rates are low. I develop four main arguments. First, I show that the current US situation, in which safe interest rates are expected to remain below growth rates for a long time, is more the historical norm than the exception. If the future is like the past, this implies that debt rollovers, that is the issuance of debt without a later increase in taxes, may well be feasible. Put bluntly, public debt may have no fiscal cost. Second, even in the absence of fiscal costs, public debt reduces capital accumulation, and may therefore have welfare costs. I show that welfare costs may be smaller than typically assumed. The reason is that the safe rate is the risk-adjusted rate of return to capital. If it is lower than the growth rate, it indicates that the risk-adjusted rate of return to capital is in fact low. The average risky rate however also plays a role. I show how both the average risky rate and the average safe rate determine welfare outcomes. Third, I look at the evidence on the average risky rate, i.e., the average marginal product of capital. While the measured rate of earnings has been and is still quite high, the evidence from asset markets suggests that the marginal product of capital may be lower, with the difference reflecting either mismeasurement of capital or rents. This matters for debt: the lower the marginal product, the lower the welfare cost of debt. Fourth, I discuss a number of arguments against high public debt, and in particular the existence of multiple equilibria where investors believe debt to be risky and, by requiring a risk premium, increase the fiscal burden and make debt effectively more risky. This is a very relevant argument, but it does not have straightforward implications for the appropriate level of debt. My purpose in the lecture is not to argue for more public debt, especially in the current political environment. It is to have a richer discussion of the costs of debt and of fiscal policy than is currently the case. © 2019 American Economic Association. All Rights Reserved."

A rich quasi-experiment suggests that the Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) Budget Program (NBP), a cap-and-trade market, decreased NOx emissions, ambient ozone concentrations, pharmaceutical expenditures, and mortality rates. The annual reductions in pharmaceutical purchases, a key defensive investment, and mortality are valued at about $800 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, suggesting that defenses are over one-third of willingness-to-pay for reductions in NOx emissions. Further, estimates indicate that the NBP's benefits easily exceed its costs and that NOx reductions have substantial benefits."

We ask how competence was affected by a zipper quota, requiring local parties to alternate men and women on the ballot, implemented by the Social Democratic Party in 1993. Far from being at odds with meritocracy, this quota raised the competence of male politicians where it raised female representation the most. We argue that resignation of mediocre male leaders was a key driver of this effect."

In addition, the delay until the project succeeds, if it ever does, increases with the number of agents. We show why deadlines, but not necessarily better monitoring, help to mitigate moral hazard."

"Auerbach A.J., Obstfeld M.",2005,American Economic Review,"Prevalent thinking about liquidity traps suggests that the perfect substitutability of money and bonds at a zero short-term nominal interest rate renders open-market operations ineffective for achieving macroeconomic stabilization goals. We show that even were this the case, there remains a powerful argument for large-scale open market operations as a fiscal policy tool. As we also demonstrate, however, this same reasoning implies that open-market operations will be beneficial for stabilization as well, even when the economy is expected to remain mired in a liquidity trap for some time. Thus, the microeconomic fiscal benefits of open-market operations in a liquidity trap go hand in hand with standard macroeconomic objectives. Motivated by Japan's recent economic experience, we use a dynamic general-equilibrium model to assess the welfare impact of open-market operations for an economy in Japan's predicament. We argue Japan can achieve a substantial welfare improvement through large open-market purchases of domestic government debt."

If the fall in the interest rate is limited by the zero lower bound, aggregate demand is insufficient and the economy enters a liquidity trap.

Our theoretical model highlights two potential sources of this distortion: short-termism and the fixed patent term. Our empirical context is cancer research, where clinical trials - and hence, project durations - are shorter for late-stage cancer treatments relative to early-stage treatments or cancer prevention. Using newly constructed data, we document several sources of evidence that together show private research investments are distorted away from long-term projects. The value of life-years at stake appears large. We analyze three potential policy responses: surrogate (non-mortality) clinical-trial endpoints, targeted R&D subsidies, and patent design. © 2015, American Economic Association.

"Anenberg E., Kung E.",2014,American Economic Review,"Using new data on real estate listings, we provide new evidence that foreclosures have a causal effect on nearby house prices and disentangle the effect into two sources: competition and disamenities. We identify the causal effect by showing that sellers respond to new REO listings in the exact week of listing, not a week before and not a week after. We disentangle competition and disamenity effects by examining the spillover effect across various stages of the foreclosure process. We find that competition effects are important in all areas, but only find evidence for disamenity effects in high density, low price neighborhoods. © 2014 by the American Economic Association."
"Head A., Lloyd-Ellis H., Sun H.",2014,American Economic Review,"The dynamics of house prices, sales, construction, and population growth in response to city-specific income shocks are characterized for 106 US cities. A dynamic model of search in the housing market in which construction, the entry of buyers, house prices, and sales are determined in equilibrium is then developed. The theory generates dynamics qualitatively consistent with the observations and a version calibrated to match key features of the US housing market offers a substantial quantitative improvement over models without search. In particular, variation in the time it takes to sell induces transaction prices to exhibit serially correlated growth."
"Oster E., Shoulson I., Dorsey E.R.",2013,American Economic Review,"We use novel data to study genetic testing among individuals at risk for Huntington disease (HD), a hereditary disease with limited life expectancy. Although genetic testing is perfectly predictive and carries little economic cost, presymptomatic testing is rare. Testing rates increase with increases in ex ante risk of having HD. Untested individuals express optimistic beliefs about their health and make decisions (e.g., retirement) as if they do not have HD, even though individuals with confirmed HD behave differently. We suggest that these facts can be reconciled by an optimal expectations model (Brunnermeier and Parker 2005)."
"Fqwlie M., Holland S.P., Mansur E.T.",2012,American Economic Review,"An advantage of cap-and-trade programs over more prescriptive environmental regulation is that compliance flexibility and cost effectiveness can make more stringent emissions reductions politically feasible. However, when markets (versus regulators) determine where emissions occur, it becomes more difficult to assure that mandated emissions reductions are equitably achieved. We investigate these issues in the context of Southern California's RECLAIM program by matching facilities in RECLAIM with similar California facilities also in nonattainment areas. Our results indicate that average emissions fell 20 percent at RECLAIM facilities relative to our counterfactual. Furthermore, observed changes in emissions do not vary significantly with neighborhood demographic characteristics."
Wang S.-Y.,2011,American Economic Review,"This paper examines the equilibrium price effects of the privatization of housing assets that were previously owned and allocated by the state. I develop a theoretical framework that shows that privatization can have ambiguous effects on prices in the private market, and that the degree of misallocation of the assets prior to privatization determines the subsequent price effects. I test the predictions of the model using a large-scale housing reform in China. The results suggest that the removal of price distortions allowed households to increase their consumption of housing and led to an increase in equilibrium housing prices."
Reed Walker W.,2011,American Economic Review,This paper uses newly available data on plant level regulatory status linked to the Census Longitudinal Business Database to measure the impact of changes in county level environmental regulations on plant and sector employment levels. Estimates from a variety of specifications suggest a strong connection between changes in environmental regulatory stringency and both employment growth and levels in the affected sectors. The preferred estimates suggest that changes in county level regulatory status due to the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments reduced the size of the regulated sector by as much as 15 percent in the 10 years following the changes. © 2011 AEA.

"Atkeson A., Kehoe P.J.",2007,American Economic Review,"Many view the period after the Second Industrial Revolution as a paradigm of a transition to a new economy following a technological revolution, including the Information Technology Revolution. We build a quantitative model of diffusion and growth during transitions to evaluate that view. With a learning process quantified by data on the life cycle of US manufacturing plants, the model accounts for the key features of the transition after the Second Industrial Revolution. But we find that features like those will occur in other transitions only if a large amount of knowledge about old technologies exists before the transition begins."
"Hellwig C., Mukherji A., Tsyvinski A.",2006,American Economic Review,"We develop a model of currency crises, in which traders are heterogeneously informed, and interest rates are endogenously determined in a noisy rational expectations equilibrium. In our model, multiple equilibria result from distinct roles an interest rate plays in determining domestic asset market allocations and the devaluation outcome. Except for special cases, this finding is not affected by the introduction of noisy private signals. We conclude that the global games results on equilibrium uniqueness do not apply to market-based models of currency crises."
Persico N.,2002,American Economic Review,"Citizens of two groups may engage in crime, depending on their legal earning opportunities and on the probability of being audited. Police audit citizens. Police behavior is fair if both groups are policed with the same intensity. We provide exact conditions under which forcing the police to behave more fairly reduces the total amount of crime. These conditions are expressed as constraints on the quantile-quantile plot of the distributions of legal earning opportunities in the two groups. We also investigate the definition of fairness when the cost of being searched reflects the stigma of being singled out by police."
Danziger L.,1999,American Economic Review,"This paper studies a general-equilibrium model of a dynamic economy with menu costs. Each firm's productivity is exposed to idiosyncratic and aggregate productivity shocks around a trend, and the money supply to monetary shocks around a trend. All consumption, pricing, and production decisions are based on optimizing behavior. There exists a staggered Markov perfect equilibrium with prices determined by a two-sided (s, S) markup strategy. The paper analyzes the optimal markup strategy and investigates the dynamics of the price index and the aggregate output. The welfare consequences of the uncertain aggregate productivity and money supply are also examined."
Cavallo A.,2017,American Economic Review,"Online prices are increasingly used for measurement and research applications, yet little is known about their relation to prices collected offline, where most retail transactions take place. I conduct the first large-scale comparison of prices simultaneously collected from the websites and physical stores of 56 large multi-channel retailers in 10 countries. I find that price levels are identical about 72 percent of the time. Price changes are not synchronized but have similar frequencies and average sizes. These results have implications for national statistical offices, researchers using online data, and anyone interested in the effect of the Internet on retail prices."
"Aizer A., Eli S., Ferrie J., Muney A.L.",2016,American Economic Review,"We estimate the long- run impact of cash transfers to poor families on children's longevity, educational attainment, nutritional status, and income in adulthood. To do so, we collected individual- level administrative records of applicants to the Mothers' Pension program-the first government- sponsored welfare program in the United States (1911-1935)-and matched them to census, WWII, and death records. Male children of accepted applicants lived one year longer than those of rejected mothers. They also obtained onethird more years of schooling, were less likely to be underweight, and had higher income in adulthood than children of rejected mothers.

"Schmieder J.F., Von Wachter T., Bender S.",2016,American Economic Review,"We estimate that unemployment insurance (UI ) extensions reduce reemployment wages using sharp age discontinuities in UI eligibility in Germany. We show this effect combines two key policy parameters: the effect of UI on reservation wages and the effect of nonemployment durations on wage offers. Our framework implies if UI extensions do not affect wages conditional on duration, then reservation wages do not bind. We derive resulting instrumental variable estimates for the effect of nonemployment durations on wage offers and bounds for reservation wage effects. The effect of UI on wages we find arises mainly from substantial negative nonemployment duration effects."
"Landvoigt T., Piazzesi M., Schneider M.",2015,American Economic Review,"This paper uses an assignment model to understand the cross section of house prices within a metro area. Movers' demand for housing is derived from a life-cycle problem with credit market frictions. Equilibrium house prices adjust to assign houses that differ by quality to movers who differ by age, income, and wealth. To quantify the model, we measure distributions of house prices, house qualities, and mover characteristics from micro-data on San Diego County during the 2000s boom. The main result is that cheaper credit for poor households was a major driver of prices, especially at the low end of the market."
Hornung E.,2014,American Economic Review,"This paper analyzes long-term effects of skilled-worker immigration on productivity for the Huguenot migration to Prussia. In 1685, religiously persecuted French Huguenots settled in Brandenburg- Prussia and compensated for population losses due to plagues during the Thirty Years' War. We combine Huguenot immigration lists from 1700 with Prussian firm-level data on the value of inputs and outputs in 1802 in a unique database to analyze the effects of skilled immigration to places with underused economic potential. Exploiting this settlement pattern in an instrumental-variable approach, we find substantial long-term effects of Huguenot settlement on the productivity of textile manufactories."
Weizsäcker G.,2010,American Economic Review,"The paper presents a meta dataset covering 13 experiments on social learning games. It is found that in situations where it is empirically optimal to follow others and contradict one's own information, the players err in the majority of cases, forgoing substantial parts of earnings. The average player contradicts her own signal only if the empirical odds ratio of the own signal being wrong, conditional on all available information, is larger than 2:1, rather than 1:1 as would be implied by rational expectations. A regression analysis formulates a straightforward test of rational expectations which strongly rejects the null."
"Vereshchagina G., Hopenhayn H.A.",2009,American Economic Review,"Entrepreneurs bear substantial risk, but empirical evidence shows no sign of a positive premium. This paper develops a theory of endogenous entrepreneurial risk taking that explains why self-financed entrepreneurs may find it optimal to invest in risky projects offering no risk premium. Consistently with empirical evidence, the model predicts that poorer entrepreneurs are more likely to undertake risky projects. It also finds that incentives for risk taking are stronger when agents are impatient. (JEL G31, G32, L25, L26)."
"Camera G., Casari M.",2009,American Economic Review,"We study the emergence of norms of cooperation in experimental economies populated by strangers interacting indefinitely. Can these economies achieve full efficiency even without formal enforcement institutions? Which institutions for monitoring and enforcement facilitate cooperation? Finally, what classes of strategies do subjects employ? We find that, first, cooperation can be sustained even in anonymous settings; second, some type of monitoring and punishment institutions significantly promote cooperation; and, third, subjects mostly employ strategies that are selective in punishment.

"Bulow J., Levin J.",2006,American Economic Review,"We develop a model in which firms set impersonal salary levels before matching with workers. Wages fall relative to any competitive equilibrium while profits rise almost as much, implying little inefficiency. Furthermore, the best firms gain the most from the system while wages become compressed. In light of our results, we discuss the performance of alternative institutions and the recent antitrust case against the National Resident Matching Program."
Yun T.,2005,American Economic Review,"This paper analyzes optimal monetary policy in a sticky price model with Calvo-type staggered price-setting. In the paper, the optimal monetary policy maximizes the expected utility of a representative household without having to rely on a set of linearly approximated equilibrium conditions, given the distortions associated with the staggered price-setting. It shows that the complete stabilization of the price level is optimal in the absence of initial price dispersion, while optimal inflation targets respond to changes in the level of relative price distortion in the presence of initial price dispersion."
"Zwick E., Mahon J.",2017,American Economic Review,"We estimate the effect of temporary tax incentives on equipment investment using shifts in accelerated depreciation. Analyzing data for over 120,000 firms, we present three findings. First, bonus depreciation raised investment in eligible capital relative to ineligible capital by 10.4 percent between 2001 and 2004 and 16.9 percent between 2008 and 2010. Second, small firms respond 95 percent more than big firms. Third, firms respond strongly when the policy generates immediate cash flows, but not when cash flows only come in the future. This heterogeneity materially affects investment-weighted estimates and supports models in which financial frictions or fixed costs amplify investment responses."
"Goldfarb A., Xiao M.",2011,American Economic Review,"We examine US local telephone markets shortly after the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The data suggest that more experienced, better-educated managers tend to enter markets with fewer competitors. This motivates a structural econometric model based on behavioral game theory that allows heterogeneity in managers' ability to conjecture competitor behavior. We find that manager characteristics are key determinants in managerial ability. This estimate of ability predicts out-of-sample success. Also, the measured level of ability rises following a shakeout, suggesting that our behavioral assumptions may be most relevant early in the industry's life cycle."
Schmitt-Grohé S.,2000,American Economic Review,"This paper studies the business-cycle fluctuations predicted by a two-sector endogenous-business-cycle model with sector-specific external increasing returns to scale. It focuses on aspects of actual fluctuations that have been identified both as defining features of business cycles and as ones standard real-business-cycle models cannot explain. For empirically realistic calibrations of the degree of returns to scale, the results suggest that endogenous fluctuations do not provide the dynamic element that is missing in existing real-business-cycle models."
Lloyd-Ellis H.,1999,American Economic Review,"Although microeconomic studies find a positive relationship between R&D and skill premia, much of the recent rise in U.S. wage inequality was accompanied by slowing labor-productivity growth and relatively slow introduction of new technologies. These conflicting observations are consistent with the effects of a skewed distribution of ""absorptive capacities"" - the rate at which technology-specific skills can be acquired - in a model of endogenous technological change. The framework is used to assess whether the productivity slowdown and the rise in wage inequality can be jointly accounted for by the contemporaneous decline in the growth rate of labor quality."
"Mendoza E.G., Tesar L.L.",1998,American Economic Review,"This paper studies tax reforms in a dynamic model of a global economy calibrated to current U.S. and European tax policies. World capital markets add consumption-smoothing and income-redistribution effects that alter closed-economy predictions. In the absence of taxes on foreign interest, welfare gains of eliminating U.S. income taxes are enlarged by up to 34 percent, at the expense of European losses caused by transitional declines in consumption and leisure, and a permanent capital outflow. In contrast, if foreign interest is taxed, the same tax reform reduces U.S. welfare 0.7 percent and increases European welfare 1.8 percent."
Jensen H.,1997,American Economic Review,"When optimal monetary policy is subject to a credibility problem, it is often argued that the government should appoint a central banker whose incentives differ from the government's. I argue, however, that such delegation does not overcome credibility problems given that delegation is discretionary and without costs ""Reappointment costs"" of delegation are shown to improve suboptimal outcomes, but credibility of optimal monetary policy turns out to be worsened At best, delegation therefore has no effects on credibility, but only if reappointment has no costs."
"Dix-Carneiro R., Kovak B.K.",2017,American Economic Review,"We study the evolution of trade liberalization's effects on Brazilian local labor markets. Regions facing larger tariff cuts experienced prolonged declines in formal sector employment and earnings relative to other regions. The impact of tariff changes on regional earnings 20 years after liberalization was three times the effect after 10 years. These increasing effects on regional earnings are inconsistent with conventional spatial equilibrium models, which predict declining effects due to spatial arbitrage. We investigate potential mechanisms, finding empirical support for a mechanism involving imperfect interregional labor mobility and dynamics in labor demand, driven by slow capital adjustment and agglomeration economies. This mechanism gradually amplifies the effects of liberalization, explaining the slow adjustment path of regional earnings and quantitatively accounting for the magnitude of the long-run effects."
