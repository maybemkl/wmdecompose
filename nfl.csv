"Yeah, and I think he got the offer (although never confirmed), but turned it down. Certainly gonna be a concern he leaves us in the coming years for the college game but that is a lot different (and less enticing) switch than being poached by an NFL team to be their HC. 

Whiz seriously would do well as a college coach though. I just hope he prefers the Chargers. We all bitch about how our offense is run sometimes, but he is at the worst an above average OC that offers unique consistency in staying with the team for long periods of time. A lot of our problems are unavoidable as well, considering our OL is a bunch of fucking goons that require an assistant OL coach position just to make sure everyone’s shoes are tied. It’s gotta be a pain in the ass scheming around Dan “fuck pass protection” Feeney when the Rams are shoving Suh and Donald down your throat every play.",nfl
"I mean, KO Gabe and Kolton battled injuries all year. Penn was out and never returned to form. So yea, playing oft-injured, starting Chaz Green, and playing rookies who weren’t supposed to start won’t yield great results. When healthy Hudson and Gabe are dominant. Can’t say the same about many on the broncos line if any. None have been dominant in their respective careers. Time will tell",nfl
"You wouldn't expect the exact same slot even with the exact same era-adjusted season and the exact same criteria, no. You'd also expect some variation based on different voters (but you'd expect that to self-equalize a bit given the moderately high number of voters).

But when you're talking about similar era-adjusted statistical performances, both with the QB winning the SB with fairly similar era-adjusted statistical performances, you wouldn't expect to see *drastically* different rankings with one viewed as #7 overall and QB2 and one viewed as #111 and QB... 8?

"What's worse is judging from this example of Hunt, the Chiefs are in a position with Hill where no decision is good.

But, if you cheer in any capacity for Tyreek, or simply accept his presence, it reflects on the team as a whole.

"I dunno, I heard some team once traded up to draft a QB in the top 10 and hired an entire new staff/coach. Then a year later, fired all the staffing/coaches/QBs.

"The 49ers had 2 interceptions all of last season.
.
TWO.

Do you understand how rare that is?  It's the historically worst, and overall they had the historically worst amount of turnovers in a season.

You can blame all sorts of things, but frankly that is unlucky as hell.  Turnovers are a fluky stat but 2 interceptions is absolutely absurd.  QBs just threw well against us without pressure off the EDGE and balls didn't bounce their way.

The odds of that repeating are slim to none.  Any team would lose that many games with only two freaking picks.",nfl

"Brady doesn’t get hit. The changes to the rules and QB’s are so much more protected now. It’s not an accident that you see all these great qbs careers lasting a lot longer. I don’t think any of Montana’s contemporaries played into their 40’s. Career starters just didn’t last that long during that time. It’s not a knock on Brady, but if you are going to use career stats, I think it needs to be mentioned.

I get it, you think Brady is the best. Cool.",nfl
"We've redesigned the offense to feature Saquon anyway. The mega trade with the Browns brought us Zeitler (good run blocking guard), offloading OBJ and Collins allowed us to sign Tate and extend Commander Shepard (both in the top 20 in blocking among active WRs), and to top it off Engram has emerged as a good checkdown receiving threat as it is when OBJ was out at the end of the season last year anyway. 

I mean, yes, it's obvious that every team is going to put 8 in the box against us, but I do like that our team has a cohesive identity on offense (and no, ""throw OBJ and pray"" doesn't count) for the first time since 2012. We're basically *daring* teams to do exactly that.",nfl
I think they all win. I think there's a silent agreement between them all that Colin will talk about them a lot and they will tweet back and link his show etc. It does nothing but keep all their names in the media.

Garbage time when the game is 99% over. 24-0 at half then 24-14 early in the 4th proves that 24-0 wasn’t a garbage time situation. The packers got back into the game. Garbage time are numbers gained in minimum 3 scores games with 7 or so mins left. Thats the earliest of “garbage time”,nfl

"This is interesting but its missing context like rushing defenses faced, year by year roster makeup etc. For instance in 2012 the Pats were running a no huddle offense that saw the Pats rush 523 times and also pass an enormous amount. Things like that, or the Pats depth at RB in 2018, factor in here and change the numbers, but understandably it would probably take hours to get through all that. Putting up 1978 yards and 25 TD's on 211 attempts is noteworthy but in the end  a difference in 0.24 yards per carry isn't a number that's gonna affect anyones opinions on both QBs. They both had some pretty great RBs, with Manning having James, Addai etc, and Brady had Dillon, Lewis, Michel etc at various points, so neither was lacking for RB help, and they both were still incredibly successful even with lead backs like Moreno and Green Ellis as their RB1s. I should also note, while maad dogs previous post was a good one and he doesn't deserve quite as much hate as some users give him, its not like Bradys best 10 year span and Mannings best 10 year span exist in some equal side by side. Brady in 2013 and 2018 was sorely lacking for passing weapons. So these comparisons are good but they aren't really that illuminating when you delve deeper.

&amp;#x200B;

I found it interesting though to look at Bradys rush production in this post. For example looking back at 2012 again, Brady ranked #1 in passing DYAR and DVOA by Football outsiders (for anyone curious manning ranked 2nd in that year in those 2 same stats, with the #3-5, Kaepernick, Rodgers, and Brees all being SIGNIFICANTLY behind them, while Manning was 2nd in Passer rating to Rodgers and 1st in ANY/A) but Brady also ranked #7 in rushing DYAR among QBs and #4 in rushing DVOA among QBs. Granted, nobody would call Brady a rushing QB, but his sneak is an incredibly efficient play, and Bradys 4 rushing TDs that year (with no fumbles) complimented 34 passing TDs for 38 total. It was his biggest rush TD number with 2011 and 2015 (3 TDs each year) tying for 2nd and 2007 (2 TD) ranking 3rd. Just thought that was a fun aside.",nfl

"&gt; addiction from actual properly taken opiates is rare

Abuse of opiates beyond prescribed dosage is a symptom of addiction and built up tolerance from prolonged use. Obviously addiction is more common in people taking more than their prescribed amount because the addiction is what leads them to take more. 

Injuries are basically an inevitability in the NFL and the culture in the past has basically encouraged team doctors to hand out pain killers at will so star players can come back as quickly as possible and role players can fight to retain their spot on the team. Maybe that's more of a culture of abuse and pressure problem rather than an inherent problem with the medications, but leaving the players to abuse pain killers and hoping they make it out of the league without incurring an opioid dependence or liver damage so they can start using marijuana to treat their now chronic pain doesn't seem like a good place to be.


Other than that, I agree with your sentiment that we need something besides acetaminophen and opiates that have obvious and well documented negative health effects, but that something isn't gonna happen overnight. CBD/marijuana is the best next option that players should at least have a choice about using.",nfl

Also the original Johnny Manziel (huge off-field concerns) type of character. 

Also, the Lions at times played better with backups than with Layne, namely in Layne’s last championship team.

This isn’t all to say Layne was bad or anything like that and I do agree Layne&gt;Tittle is the right choice (frankly Tittle is an odd selection as I think both Ryan and Layne have a case over him). Hell, I think Layne&gt;Ryan has merit but it’s not preposterous to have Ryan&gt;Layne.",nfl

It appears AFC Championship Game was his most difficult, not his Superbowl. AFC Championship seems clearly his most difficult defenses but everything else is kind of all over the place.

"It was actually at the end of a three game win-streak for Wentz, where we'd won by more than 2 TDs each game, but Pittsburgh was the first good team we faced.  Then we lost a  heartbreaker to the Lions and the season was mostly downhill from there.",nfl
"The guys that can come in and get onto a roster Day 1 are really, really rare. Because college concepts are so different, some of them simplified to an insane degree, a lot of players need a lot of work. 

With the current CBA, this is almost impossible. The offseason had it's balls cut off, and practice time is so limited it isn't worth anything. It's why we've seen worse and worse O-Line play, because guys need time to get cohesive as a unit that they just don't get.

On the other hand, a minor league owned entirely by NFL franchises, like we see in other sports, wouldn't have the same contract issues that leagues like the CFL do. ""Send (X) down to the minors to get some play time"" would actually be a viable option.",nfl

"I wasn’t thinking that she was a prostitute, and certainly not factoring it in. It’s not nearly as bad because the assault wasn’t nearly as extreme an assault. IIRC, it was a kick or two to the ass/back, and he wasn’t really winding up to them. Meanwhile Tyreek’s breaking his kid’s arm and threatening his fiancée, while Ray Rice knocked his wife/gf (I forget which and don’t want to look it up) our and had to drag her. Two vastly different planes. 

Not condoning any assault, just differentiating them",nfl
"Poke holes in this argument- team cap space should adjust based on their record, that way teams like the Pats who are constantly successful have to keep adjusting their cap to fit everyone. 

It would adjust down the line, so like 3 years later their cap would decrease. But this way it prevents dynasties and encourages true parity. 

Money successful teams lose out on would be given to unsuccessful teams. Cap space still rolls over, etc. not sure how much cap I would take away from a successful team, but I would say any team that makes the playoffs is eligible for cap reduction, and the amount you lose correlates to your finishing in the playoffs. Again, it wouldn’t be taken away immediately- it would be deducted in the future. Encourages safe spending, up-front guaranteed money, frontloaded contracts. Prevents dynasties. Gives small boost to perennially-bad teams. 

Also it’s something I just thought of like 2 minutes ago so you don’t have to be mean just curious how this would be receieved",nfl

"To be honest I can not speak for the rankers who did feel that it was right to rank Ebron in the top 100. I see a few possibilities. First, they might not have felt right including so few TEs, which is something I had no issue doing and played no factor into what I thought but it’s a possibility. Second, they really liked the fact that he led (or almost led - I’m not at my computer) TEs in total TDs. Again, not something I weigh heavily. A third argument, and one that I saw at one point during the discussion period, was the jump that the colts red zone offense had this season over last season. Maybe he received credit from certain voters for helping that part of their offense. 

Those are really the only things I can think of. Not the criteria I would use, but that’s going to happen when you have 51 people submitting their own lists I guess.

Edit: what I saw in Ebron is someone who had really high TD numbers, but who didn’t block remotely well (and wasn’t a good enough all around receiver to justify looking past the bad blocking.) I think that it was Maad who said that he was great at catching touchdowns but was average-to-below-average at every other aspect of being a TE, which I don’t think I could say better myself.",nfl
"Since AB and Bell make choice C a clear winner, my second tier would be Flacco Shepard and Freeman. Shepard is a great blocker as well as a really good catcher, which gives Flacco his best weapon of his career. Freeman running with Shep throwing blocks is a good way to win. Flacco’s checkdowns to Freeman also help out a lot. Basically it’d Be a running offense with them but i’d Like to see them all on a team together.",nfl
"Please say you're not an ohio state fan because if you are, you are really dumb. Nick's injury was worse than originally thought.

He wasn't going to play again no matter what.     
That said, him being a captain meant that he should have stayed on the team, but I guess he really hates school.",nfl

The gist of it is the universe is randomly generated each game, as are game goals and bonuses. You pick an alien race which has unique bonuses and you're colonizing planets. You're doing this by managing 5 resources and 5 advancement tracks that give bonuses over time. 

It's a very ""thinky"" game where the 4 hours played felt like 30 minutes. I was immersed the entire time and see why it's highly praised.",nfl
I really want more weird sports dreams. The last one I remember was the Dolphins beating the Giants in the 2019 NFCCG to face the Patriots in Super Bowl 53. I want dreams like the Padres clinching the NL West over the Dodgers in a walk off grand slam on the final day of the season.,nfl
"I agree but the same can be said for Marino and he had *less* playoff success than Elway (18-18 career record and 1 SB appearance to Elway's 22-21 and five Super Bowls) while having better... pretty much everything (outside of rushing yards, of course). Elway was just good at pushing his mediocre team through the playoffs. Marino got to the AFCCG three times in his career, lost two of them, and every other season his team lost in the divisional or wild card round. Elway went to six AFCCGs and won five of them.",nfl
"The era he played in was a huge factor, though. Being the best starting QB in the league is a lot different when there are 32 teams compared to 8-12. There was no playoffs as well, the Super Bowl was just played between the teams with the best record in each conference. 

The New York Yankees were Graham's opponent in his first 2 championship games... By far the best of his time, but comparing him to Brady is laughable.",nfl
"He's consistently been losing weight each year. In a press conference the other day he said he weighed 313.8 and said he might put on 3-4 more lbs. Last year he played at 317, year before 324-325, year before that 327-328, and year before that 330. Has no intention of gaining weight, claims it's for his health outside the NFL and make it better on his joints to make his career last longer.",nfl
"I watched all his snaps in the week 17 game against Miami, and he looks like the same guy as always. He's a great athlete and makes a handful of great plays per game, but they're far outweighed by his inconsistent accuracy. 

In this game Miami failed to bring their A game on defense. A number of times he threw passes behind the receiver on short slants, but they turned into big plays anyway because the Dolphins defender missed the tackle. He had a long touchdown pass where there was busted coverage (although the pass wasn't all that easy since he was forced to throw off his back foot).

And then he had a number of straight up bad plays. He had an absolutely terrible pick 6, and completely missed a guy who was wide open.

Overall he's a guy who makes big plays with his athleticism, but his play-to-play accuracy just isn't there.",nfl
"He does have a very intriguing history and you can totally understand why the players were able to buy into what he was selling after that start and finishing with a top 10 draft pick for the past 2 seasons prior. I think he's got a chance to be the head coach for quite some time, tenure comparable to Grudens.",nfl
"holy moly, 6 super bowls and literally every single fucking player on his team has changed and the system qb argument is still made. News flash, belichick was fired as a HC without brady, is 19-19 on the pats all time without brady, and was 5-13 from 2000 to 2001 before Brady stepped in and took over for Bledsoe a great QB and elevated the Pats to go 11-3 and win the Superbowl with him under center. There is literally no defense for this argument just give it up. 

Brady was the only player to change and it caused an immediate 55%+ win rate spike, and he replaced a great QB not some shitty backup. 

Brady has won multiple super bowls without Edelman, Gronk (who was broken to shit this year for the most part), and Gordon who had to learn the entire playbook and then left in 10 games total.",nfl
"Dude he won an MVP, 4 Super Bowls, and 2 Super Bowl MVPs. There's no ground to stand on to argue Bradshaw out. He's not a top 20 QB of all time, he wasn't a better player than several guys who are never going to get in but he's a HOFer beyond any question",nfl
"Sorry, DMD, F4240 is correct.  Jets paid the $8MM.  The Jets can spread the signing bonus over the duration of the contract.  However, if the Jets trade him, they can no longer spread that expense and it hits the cap all at once.

Adams might not be the fastest. But for the 10 yards where he wants separation not many can keep up with him...

"Can Kyler pan out? Sure, but that's not the issue I have with Keim.

From a football management perspective, he traded up to get a QB last year, who was in the conversation as one of the top QBs in the draft, which by itself is a good move. The team then went on to be the worst in the league because they had a terrible HC (who was in his first year, and I do agree he should have been fired), a terrible OC, and a terrible offensive line. One of the best backs in the league two years ago wasn't being used properly for god sake. So they go out and get a new coach. I bet they could have found a HC who would have loved to work with Rosen and DJ. Instead, they go with Kingsbury, and want to draft a new QB at first overall. From a personal perspective, he got a DUI and blew a .19.

If I were the owner, I would seriously question his decision making ability at every level. I would not trust someone who told me it's a good idea to trade up and get a highly regarded QB, and then ditch the plan entirely the next season and go a completely different direction.",nfl
"The Patriots have great weapons in the backfield (Michel was injured for most of the season yet had an above-average rookie year, James White is arguably a top 5 pass catching RB albeit poor in the run game, and James Develin is one of the best FBs in the game) and their offensive line is great. 

I think the hard truth is that Brady will be 42 at the start of the season.",nfl

Mingo was a great special teams guy for the Pats, but that's about it - that's still an improvement over his play with the Browns, admittedly, but he wasn't a key contributor.

This is something the Patriots are good at, though, you just picked weak examples.  Van Noy and Welker are better choices.",nfl
"Our punter Ryan Allen re-signed on a one-year deal, but we spent a 5th rounder on Jake Bailey who has impressed in rookie camp and OTA's. Not only can he be a punter but he is also a kickoff specialist. I would argue Bailey is the favorite to get the job.

We have a trio of DE's: Keionta Davis, Derek Rivers, and Deatrich Wise Jr. that are all entering their third year. One of those guys, maybe two, isn't making the team. 

Our cornerback room is incredibly deep and we aren't going to be able to keep everyone. Someone with a lot of talent and potential isn't going to make the team.",nfl

And, you know, if recent times aren't given some type of priority and we're counting pre-merger titles as if they're equal to SBs the Browns have the 3rd-most titles in the NFL. Guess they belong in the ELoE.

You listed 3 games where he failed to score more than 17 points and a game where his team was a huge reason they had enough points to get to OT despite the fact that Peyton had given the opponent points. Like you’re saying rahim Moore cost the broncos 7 points but Peyton did too

And yea, he played better than Brady in that specific matchup, he also had a much much better offense, and more importantly, nobody feels the need to make excuses for Brady in that game.

Nope. To make it to the Hall from the Bengals you literally have to be the GOAT at your position like Munoz was.

All the throws people can't believe Mahomes is making? Elway was making those same throws back in the 1980's. Elway threw a bunch of picks, which is probably why his QB Rating is low, but that was somewhat common for that era... but then Elway usually did enough to overcome any mistakes he made. Judge that how you will (many use it to say, ""see, he _was_ garbage!""), but I'll take the mobile gunslinger QB with superior talent who gets wins over the safe QB of average talent who loses games.

Having watched both now, I can't shake the feeling that Mahomes is the heir to Elway's QB style, a similar talent but placed in this modern era of football.",nfl

Its very reasonable to know they were in and won 2 Super Bowls in the 90s so unless you're a Broncos fan, old enough to remember it, or read a lot of Wiki pages its exceedingly reasonable to think the guy that said ""he went took them to 3 Super Bowls"" included the 2 everyone knows about",nfl
"I’d challenge you to put together any 5 years worth of stats that make Wilson look bad. You’re taking this post in like the exact opposite direction. He’s not calling out any specific events, or individual games, or anything about his defense. He was just highlighting the volume and efficiency stats which, undeniably, aren’t stellar. Now there’s clearly reasons why Elway is regarded as highly as he is, but the statistics have never been one of them.",nfl
"I grew up in the early 90’s and Elway was always one of the league’s superstars. Something about Elway in the 80’s had to have bolstered that.

Cannot trust him to lead my team",nfl
"Stephenson didn't have more years (they both had 8), and he wasn't the starter for all of them.  Csonka was the starter for all of his.  Further, Csonka is one of the faces of the team *already*, while Stephenson has never been this.  And Csonka still has the advantage of being the representative from the only Super Bowl teams (Shula is a poor fit due to him coaching for like half of the team's existence).",nfl

"Matt Ryan, and he's been better for a number of years now.

Roethlisberger is still good but his ""5000"" yard season was the result of a bunch of screen passes and yards after the catch. He was one of the worst quarterbacks in the league last year when it came to actual air yards. 

Ben's thrown almost double the amount of picks Ryan has in the last three seasons.",nfl
"He’s gonna become more of a pocket passer now that he can relax in the pocket and make quick decisions. His release is super quick, a huge chunk of his yardage is a result of avoiding the sack, versus actually scrambling first, much moreso after the injury, he became a different player. 5 TDs on Miami at the end of the season. He’s got a way better OL in front of him now, and Zay Jones is probably our 4th receiver now instead of our 2nd, plus our TE group is potentially improved, I think Knox is gonna be an early contributor. It’s up to Allen to prove it.",nfl
"Well for one thing, the values attached are completely arbitrary; for instance, the Ravens earned 4 'points' for Flacco joking about tripping someone in a superbowl, i.e. they got cheat points for something that didn't even happen.

"Any person should be allowed to coach based on their abilities. The best players are sometimes the worst coaches and vice-versa. Not every NFL coach was even a player in the NFL.

That said, I do take issue with the ""unfair shot as players at a young age."" Sure, girls can definitely compete with boys when they're both children, but that changes after puberty.

"&gt; You get points for assists so I don't know how true this is. Gretzky definitely had better teammates overall.

Yeah, but if your teammates are bad, they probably won't score when you set them up.

&gt; Agreed. But when you control for average goals per game, Gretzky had 5.6% more points in his highest scoring season than Lemieux. That's a significant margin but isn't heads and shoulders better

"Oh I know, I mean those statlines aren't really equivalent when you compare eras, but in the early 2000s you could go farther with even a below-average quarterback because defense and the running game were so much more important because of the era.

I don't buy it though. I'm sure he gave them general ideas for how the story concludes but he has no fucking clue how to actually reach that point.

Signed him after that 6 TD game but iono...feel like the drops TO had for us during the preseason and the rise of Wilson kinda did him in and he didn't get the opportunity to showcase what he was capable of. The Jim Mora era had some super bad signings though...a lot of them,nfl
"If the Ravens can get him to a 3000 yard passer and work on his fumbling, they'll be fine. He won't ever be Brady or Manning but he'll make up for what he lacks in passing, on the ground. Combine his talents with Ingram/Edwards/Hill and our defense and the Ravens are gonna run the AFCN. 

I 110% believe he'll be a OPOY/MVP candidate in the near future. As long as just gets better, works on fumbling and doesn't suffer the same fate RG3 did.",nfl

"Forget whether it was tdeath or not (probably not) but one ranker dismissed the AFCC because ""to me, his game averaged out to average and they won because they won a coin toss""--which only made even limited sense on the theory that the Pats were *definitely* scoring a TD on the first drive of OT in Arrowhead... and if you thought that it would seem to follow that Brady's a really fucking good QB.",nfl

"How in the world is Ramsey above Byron Jones? One of these men was an All Pro on one of the best defenses in the league. The other one is Ramsey.

"I get  that his experience with team doctors/trainers/strength coaches sucked, but some of what he's saying is very specific to his experience and needs to be taken with a grain of salt. At 20:43 he expresses an opinion that third party trainers/strength coaches are better than the people employed by the team. He then says the NFL is ""years behind"" in terms of training and rehab but can't really name any examples of this other than his spleen incident and some half-formed point about training for specificity.

There are certainly teams, coaches, and orgs that are old school and stupid, but there are also a lot of fantastic teams. Joe Kenn in Carolina and Buddy Morris in Arizona are fucking LEGENDS in S&amp;C and anyone who would seek out a third party strength coach over them is ignorant. Eric Sugarman and his AT staff in Minnesota are renown nationwide for their rehab skill. Not taking advantage of resources like that is insane, even if you have a great independent trainer/coach available. Not to mention that for every player who hires a competent independent off-season trainer, there are a bunch of other players who don't hire a trainer at all or hire their buddy from high school who got a weekend Crossfit certification. Sounds like Simms had a shitty strength coach and AT staff and is still salty about it. He should be, but his experience isn't indicative of the entire league.

And finally, just because I always beat this drum... The whole argument of ""athletes know best"" is based on the fallacy that because these guys are good athletes they must know what it takes to become a good/better athlete. That's fundamentally untrue. Ask *anyone* in the S&amp;C or athletic training world if their athletes know what it takes get in shape and improve themselves. Spoiler alert: they don't know shit about training and nutrition. They're gifted humans, sure. But they aren't kinesiologists or strength coaches. They don't understand nutrition. They can't write a periodized training program. Outside of a few guys in every program who truly love the gym, these guys don't know what to do to get faster or stronger. If they had their way, most of their workouts would consist of half-assed stretching, a few sprints, and some glamour muscle lifting in the mirror. Strength coaches and ATs exist to ensure these guys are actually making progress. There are some bad ones and some really great ones, and unfortunately it sounds like Chris' experience was only with the former.",nfl
"It’s sort of odd to me that we get roasted for doing this but if a team trades the ranch to move up for a QB nobody cares.

* 2nd rounder (2018) 
* 4th rounder 
* 3rd rounder 

For Wentz.

"It'd take such intensive study to get an accurate measure, and even then there's so many holes. PFR has AV and there's the PFF grades, but they are so open to criticism they should be taken with a grain of salt at best.

"If we’re going to have a cold, hard truth, it’s that Schott doesn’t trust Russ at the end of the day, and it affects our entire offensive capabilities. This may have turned around this offseason, but we’re going to have to wait and see Russ trying to play catch up and managing the field to see if the relationship has improved at all. At the point Schott demanded a timeout be called to specifically tell Russ to stop audibling out of his plays, that’s a bad sign that demonstrates the OC doesn’t trust your single-most reliable piece of offense on the team. That has to change moving forward or our offense won’t stand a chance.",nfl
"The blackhawks were named after the 86th Infantry Division during WW1, which was nicknamed the Blackhawks after the native american leader.

Though the 86th Infantry's logo was quite a bit less racist. It was -  *drumroll please* - a[ literal black hawk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/86th_Infantry_Division_\(United_States\)#/media/File:86_Inf_Div_SSI.jpg). No native american caricatures, just a bird colored black. The Blackhawks *could* have kept the logo as a black bird, but decided to put a native american head as the logo instead. It was a conscious choice

For the record, the UH-60 Blackhawk didn't enter active service until the 80s, so the logo choice for the hockey team was absolutely not the helicopter (the helicopter itself is named after the native american leader, as a part of US military naming conventions for helicopters)

Honestly, a lot of the splitting hairs about the technical origin of native names annoys the hell out of me. Maybe in the distant past the name wasn't really relating to native peoples, but the name today and all the branding associated with the name today is heavily based on native stereotypes",nfl

Edit: Also the whole part where she allegedly fucked Lucky Whitehead when Cowboys came to Ohio is just another reason to believe this is some vindictive, vengeful girl who was upset Zeke was done with her when he turned pro.

They didn’t love him. They clearly did like him. We heard it throughout the process. He was their 3rd pick. So regardless if they drafted him at 10 or 42 he’s on the roster now and nabbed two other guys they liked. If he can ball he’ll ball all the same.,nfl

I love Vic but people really think he was the reason our defense was so great but ignore the prior 3 years where it wasn’t as great. They fail to realize that Vic runs a rather vanilla defense. He relies on player talent for his defense to work. Similar to Lovie Smith with his Tampa 2. Of course any good defense needs talent.

Teams find ways to distribute cap dollars to keep any one player's (even a QB) cap hit reasonable. This is why Seattle refused, I think, to give Russ a % of the salary cap -- it took away all of the team's flexibility.

Would you give Aaron Rodgers an extra 2% of your cap space to have him on your team?

Let's look at it another way...

Let's say Russ took a ""team-friendly"" deal cause his ""wife is super rich and blah blah blah"". Let's say he took $30m/yr instead of $35m/yr.

That extra $5m will buy you QTY 1 Barkevious Mingo.

That extra $5m will buy you QTY 1 Torrey Smith.

That extra $5m will buy you QTY 1 Michael Pierce and QTY 1 Alex Lewis. 

That extra $5m will buy you QTY 1 Todd Davis.

Or let's look at it another way:

Bobby Wagner, Golden Tate, Russell Wilson, KJ Wright, Stephen Houshka, Richard Sherman, Malcom Smith, Doug Baldwin, Jermaine Kearse, JR Sweezy -- all under $1m each against the 2013 Seahawks salary cap.


# MY POINT IS...

The Patriots win Superbowls because of coaching, scheme, talent acquisition and ruthless roster management. Their coaches know how to use the talent that is there to a degree no other teams understand.

If QB's took up 30/40/50% of a cap -- yeah you've got a problem. But look how ridiculously different the Browns looked when Mayfield's swagger walked through the doors. It gave the team hope, it gave them someone to rally around. A franchise QB -- and a good one at that -- is worth every penny. And it *doesn't* take away from the rest of the team. It makes the rest of the team immeasurably better.",nfl

I guess I was addicted (or still am). I never thought quitting weed would be this hard. 

Don't be too hard on yourself, you're a good person.

My cousin tried to kill herself with Tylenol and survived, but I worry about the long term affects on her liver and her possibly dying young. She abused alcohol and drugs too (and still might, I don't know). 

Suicide is a terrible thing, and I just can't do that to my parents. It would kill them inside and they would spend the rest of their lives blaming themselves, and I love them too much to do that to them, even though ending my pain would be wonderful. 

We should all be kind to each other. Take care, I hope you get through your drunkeness tonight (go to bed, I'm going to bed) and are not too hungover tomorrow. Maybe tomorrow will be a good day for us both.",nfl
"Unlike Dwayne Haskins and Kyler Murray, Daniel Jones was a starter for two years in a row and was not mocked in the first round. Haskins and Murray were relatively unknowns and had a huge season with tape and stats to propel them in the first round I'd have to wager. I refuse to believe that in Jone's last season, his tape was much better than his previous two years; he barely improved statistically. Otherwise, I guess Mock drafts for next year are all b.s and halfbutted.",nfl

Yeah I think that was smart of them not to give in to temptation of all the good players available and strengthen up their protection for matt ryan. Our offensive lineman was the heart and soul of our team last year for the colts and was the reason we performed so well and won 10/11 to end the season and make the playoffs so it was smart of them to add to that area for them especially while everyone else added so much to their d-lines,nfl

No, you're literally saying that you don't understand why people are addressing your lies and are putting things in context.

&gt; I happen to think that what he did (and his lack of remorse) are so egregious that there can be no explanation sufficient.

Great, if so, then why do you object to people understanding the context and the actual facts?  If your argument is based on lies and removing the context, then it's a shitty argument.  So, I'm sorry, but if you earnestly believe that there is no explanation, then if you just stop lying, then it's not a problem.

&gt; You, presumably, do not

I don't think there's really any excuse for his actions, but that doesn't mean that the facts and the context aren't important to understanding what and how it happened.

Inefficiency wasn't a thing when George was playing- you're using present day metrics to judge a player from the past. You shouldn't. YPC doesn't tell the story as McNair was a little limited (definitely limited by mediocre receivers) and the Titans gameplan was to pound the shit out of the opposing defense and wear them down in the 4th quarter and eat cloxk/manage the game. George was like a battering ram and perfect for what the Titans wanted to do on offense.,nfl
"Its a funny question because I probably would take Rodgers in that situation. But right now, and evidenced by the past few seasons, Luck and Wilson would be less likely to get in that situation. So I'd take Rodgers on a must-score TD drive, but Luck or Wilson for a season.

"I like all of what you said here - including two byes a year. They can play two preseason games or none at all - teams can adjust, replacing them with scrimmages.

And ditch the inactive list.",nfl
"We were forced to go off of the gold standard because it would have collapsed the monetary system at that time if Nixon didnt. Every country was asking for their gold at the time and we didn't have enough to back up our spending. 

We didn't evolve from it like we did from horses to automobiles - that's a horrible example. Fiat is nothing revolutionary, history is ripe with examples of its dismal record of it eventually devaluing to zero. You're not even giving a real reason as to why fiat, which means ""given by decree,"" is superior to gold.

You're also assuming that central bankers don't make mistakes when controlling our currency or centrally planning interest rates. Thats a pretty dangerous proposition.

The problem is most people who have taken economics courses at universities don't understand real economic or the ramifications of not considering the the supply and demand for money.

Most people don't understand that the greatest growth in economic history occurred pre Fed when we underwent a deflationary boom.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Deflation

Falling prices due to an increase in productivity is good, and by definition an increase in standard of living. **In fact the reason for the growing wealth inequality today isn't because of capitalism, its central bank monetary policy.** Academic economists and Fed bankers have brainwashed everyone into thinking that inflation is good and deflation is invariably bad.

TLDR : you as well as the thousand  PhD economists that work under the Fed are extremely misguided in their view of history and economics during the gold standard. I'd rather trust the opinion of some of the most successful investors in history (Ray Dalio and Jeffrey Gundlach) on the current financial system than theirs.",nfl
"The biggest reasons we lost last season were because of o-line play and d-line play, two areas where we are pretty strong. We just got out coached. That could very well happen again, but it would still be because of coaching, which is why Garret would likely be fired. We have plenty of talent on the roster right now.",nfl
"I think the issue is that there’s no logical reason why they *couldnt* both be the best in their respective positions. I’d agree some people go too far in discrediting him, but that’s a reaction to that particular false premise

In 2001 just before the pats dynasty started, if I’d asked someone what it would look like if a team happened to get the best coach and qb ever on the same team, they’d probably say it would look something like Montana’s 49ers, maybe the QBs volume would be more like Marino’s. I’m not sure anyone would’ve even gone as far as expecting them to win their conference over half the time together

The other thing is that obviously BB is pretty much set once he won 3 SBs in 4 seasons after Brady became his starting qb. If Peyton plays better against the pats in 03 or 04, they have an excellent shot at winning two more SBs, and dungys all time standing would improve. Similarly, Brady could’ve thrown a pick 6 at the end of SB 36, or just had a terrible game before reaching the SB, and what would we think of BB then?

As much as we acknowledge that coaches play a role in QBs success, we also judge coaches on their accomplishments, and the qb is on the field with the ball in his hands. There’s nothing a coach can do if their qb just happens to play poorly in a playoff game",nfl
"Lombardi denied it. But in the world of football there are political implications to everything you say so if it were true Lombardi would deny it.

All I know is what I saw on the field. When Cooter first took over everybody was taking about how great the new ""simplified"" playbook was. Stafford thrived. But the problem with simplified playbooks is people tend to figure them out quickly, especially if you only put certain players on the field when you plan to use them on one particular play. Defenses knew what we were going to run just by looking at which of our players were lining up.

Anyway, Stafford was horrible under Lombardi. He got better under the simplified playbook. These are readily apparent to anyone who was watching at the time. From mid season 2015 to week 13 2016 he played the best football of his career before the league caught on.

Now Bevell is the new Lombardi, which if we had a different QB might work out okay, but it seems like Patricia is trying to build the opposite kind of team our QB is suited for. We're paying a premium for a big arm that we don't plan on using very often. If our offense is just going to be run, run, run, punt and sometimes throw, what the hell is the premium-priced, big-arm Quarterback for?",nfl

If the MVP award actually went to the Most Valuable Player in the league, the same 3 or 4 players would win it every year.

Osgood knew he was going to be WR4 at best.

"Yes, the common knowledge is that: you run more -&gt; defenses line up to stop the run -&gt; you can now pass easily because the defense is in a run stop formation

But that’s not how NFL defenses work, in an overwhelming majority of cases the defenses line up to match up the offensive formation. So if you keep lining up in 11 personnel then the defense will keep lining up in nickel (i.e. pass stopping formation) no matter how much you run because the alternative is lining up in base vs 3 WRs, which means you now have to match up a LB on their WR, which usually means an easy 1st down. That’s how the Rams keep rushing against light boxes, by going with 11 personnel.

Likewise, if you keep lining up in 21 personnel with a FB then the defense will stay in a base package because the alternative is giving up numbers in the box and allowing free 5+ yard runs on every down. That’s how the Patriots keep defenses in base formation and dictate match ups from there.

So no matter how much the Packers use Aaron Jones, no DC will start stacking the box against an offense that has Aaron Rodgers + 3 WRs on the field.",nfl

On the other hand, you can't penalize a team for playing within a season structure that ends with the NFL championship. They won the last game of the season and that should count for something. I don't believe they should be held as equal to the current nfc championship for that reason. They are more important. However they should be considered lesser than super bowls.

That's essentially saying that rookie Josh Rosen and Tom Brady are of the same caliber as QB's. That having the greatest QB of all time wouldn't boost your team's capabilities by even a single win. And it's upvoted... I get that people thought highly of Josh even after a poor year, but that's insane. We've seen bad teams with elite QB's and they don't pick #1 overall.",nfl
"Yeah but those sacks are likely not as rough as the ones back then.

Also are players really all that much bigger now?  Large players specifically DL and LBs are a phenomenon from the 90s and kind of the 80s.

A lot of LBs now are well under 250.  Most DBs are smaller.  DL players are mostly in the low 300s.

If anything offenses got bigger.",nfl
"I would say we are approaching critical time for Sammy. His contract is loaded with outs after next year and based on what we are paying him he needs to perform to stay. 

When he was healthy last year he had some moments where he looked like a beast. He runs like a running back after the catch and showed good hands a few times. He is only 26 so I hope this is his breakout year otherwise his days in KC will be numbered.",nfl

"Depends on your criteria but every year it gets tougher to put him over Brady. I personally out him at 3. 

If you’re gonna count playoffs as a big part that puts Brady as 1, and then I don’t think you can put him over Montana either.

If you aren’t going to count playoff success I think he’s #1.",nfl
"It's really tough to call. 

The team, IMO, has enough talent to make the playoffs but a lot of that talent spends time on IR. 

The defense was terrible the last 2 seasons. The upgraded passrush should improve the defense as a whole considerably. They also replaced the DL and DB coaches. Those were the two most underperfoming position groups on the team. They've also made some comments about changing up the defensive scheme a bit.

The offense we know will at least be decent. Shanahan alone gives us that. Jimmy G is the big question. We still haven't seen what he looks like as the long term starter with a full grasp of the offense. His 3 games last year were a mixed bag. Some really bad plays and some eye opening amazing plays. The receiving corps is going to have to rely on rookies which is always worrying. Pettis showed flashes though and Kittle is elite, so they're in decent shape there. With Tevin Coleman and Jet McKinnon coming back we should see what Shanahan's offense was supposed to look like last year before McKinnon got hurt. 

Theres just too many question marks to really call it one way or the other. If Jimmy G looks good, Samuel is legit, the passrush improves and the secondary stay healthy I could see as many as 10-11 wins. 

If we're injury riddled, the secondary really was the problem rather than the passrush and the rookie WRs/Pettis don't get it done, and Jimmy G sucks we could be as low as 4 wins again.",nfl

"I watch bits and pieces of UGA games since they're on a decent bit and since I live in the area I hear about them a lot on the radio. Fromm is a very good game manager, which I don't meant negatively. Like RealFloridaMan said, he does a lot of things well but he doesn't wow you. The kid is very composed but UGA is built on its run game and defense. He's short-ish at 6'2 and while he's not a statue he also isn't a phenomenal runner. Chad Pennington might be the best pro comp.

It will be interesting to see the jump he makes this offseason. His best game was last year against Bama. Usually he isn't given a lot of opportunities because UGA loves to run the ball first. They mainly got to the title game his freshman year because of that run game (Chubb+Michel), defense (Roquan Smith+others), and an insane senior class. 

He isn't a bad player by any means. I just 1) don't think he should leave early and 2) I think an NFL team would be foolish to take him in the 1st round, especially at #4. You want a game-changing face of the franchise guy at that pick. We'll see how Herbert and Eason (great size+arm strength but only one year of actually playing) develop and if Ehlinger+Mond come through too.

Aikman retired over a decade before him with a higher completion percentage and pretty similar stats otherwise, though McNabb's TD-INT ratio is quite better.

"I don't know if anyone other than a league official (or anyone part of the Competition Committee who was there when the change was made) can give you a definitive answer. 

A QB kneel is a play where the QB is giving himself up, similar to when he's sliding. Where as a spike is the QB faking one live play for another. The difference in the intent of the original play (and resulting intended safety of the player) is likely the reason one is allowed and the other isn't. Remember, once the QB gives himself up he's protected for his safety, the league doesn't want QB's to exploit obvious safety related calls for an advantage.",nfl
"But he wasn’t impeding his path. If the ball was anywhere but Hitchens back it’s probably a catch.

But also they got their first ring and I’m happy for them. Idk just seems like everyone is so focused on who they hate and why that hate is valid compared to the hate for other teams, or why a certain fan base is lame for hating a team that doesn’t hate them back as much.

"Well first, the Colts and Titans games you picked where played in really shitty weather. The titans game it was like -10 degrees with windchill. The 2003 game against the colts was being played in steady sleet. 

As for SB 36, that’s fair but I think they were ultra conservative especially because he was a week removed from getting knocked out of the AFCCG with an injury. Once they let him start “slinging” it, he accumulated over 20% of their total offense in 90 seconds. Frankly it was probably a strategic mistake not to have him throw more

Then you picked a game where they were down 24-0 in the first quarter and Brady had 42 pass attempts. It was a bad game for Brady but it’s not like they didn’t try to throw the ball",nfl

"Any team could have been competitive in the NFC East over the last 15 years. There's been no program that's been consistently strong for more than a few seasons in a row since Andy Reid left the Eagles.  

You look at any other division, and there's usually at least one team that's been able to put together 4 or 5 consecutive winning seasons in that period: 

Patriots  
Steelers  
Broncos  
Colts  
Seahawks  
Falcons  
Packers  

Some have more longevity than others, but each of those divisions each had one team that built something consistent for at least 5 years.

The most the NFC East has had in the last 20 years are teams with 3 consecutive winning seasons. 

The bad news for the Bills winning the NFCEast now is that the Cowboys and Eagles both have three consecutive winning seasons coming into 2019, so one or both of them stands ready to hold serve and be a consistent force.",nfl
"Browns fan here. I always seemed to give him a pass while most of my browns fans seemed to rag on him. So when I finally gave in and truly watched him, the biggest issue I found is he clearly takes more plays off than any other guy on the field.

"Yes, the back up QB threw less. I’m also only talking about ~100 yards here, so if Foles gets 50 it’s not outrageous. Wentz’s numbers barely project to 4000, you can’t comfortably say he gets there especially as passing numbers tend to dip at the end of the season. His numbers were close enough to 4000 that before his injury it was very reasonable to doubt him getting there. 

This discussion is 2 years old because the exact god damn conversations were happening when he was in the running for MVP before he was injured. Yards were low because the Eagles were ahead and he could’ve gotten more yards and comfortably project to over 4000.",nfl
"No. The defense got tons of turnovers that set up a lot of short fields and our running game was strong. Even if he plays all 16 games he’d have been somewhere around 4100 yards and that’s assuming he doesn’t get the same week 17 treatment Foles got.

The memorable part of Wentz’s numbers that everyone was going crazy about was 33 TDs in 13 games. He finished the season 1 TD behind Wilson for the league lead and he only played 12.75 games. He had the field basically lapped in TD passes and finishes with 35+ if he doesn’t get hurt.",nfl

They might as well let lock play if the team is in a bad spot or Flacco stinks it up as usual. Plus the broncos have great infrastructure now. Great OL coach, great OC. Lock is gonna be good for them, maybe not right away, But he needs reps to get there.",nfl
"&gt; Don’t sleep on Teddy B. 

The fact that people still believe in Teddy is mindbottling to me.  He was a waaaaay below average player when he was on the vikings, and people just jerk off to the ""advanced metrics"" which show he was the 2nd most accurate QB to the passes in the deep left third on 2nd and medium downs in the 1st quarter (or whatever bullshit people concoct) to pretend like he didn't average like 120 yards a game.

THEN he nearly needs his leg amputated and misses 2 seasons of football.

THEN he comes back, gets into a game, and throws a fucking pick.

THEN literally nothing happens for another year, and people somehow STILL think he has a future.

MAYBE if he had never got hurt, and was kept in a stable situation, he could have made it to being a fringe top 24 QB in the league.  That didn't happen, he isn't a good backup.",nfl
"If Shurmur and Gettleman get fired, I could see Mara search for a HC/GM combo that believes in Jones and tries to develop/build around him. The Giants seem like a more conservative organization who wouldnt make a crazy move like drafting QB's in the top 10 in consecutive years.

Honestly the Cardinals move just seems way too absurd to ever happen again. Considering the fact they got such an abysmal return for a valuable asset (whether the 10th pick used or Rosen himself is that asset), I dont think teams will be eager to follow that model.",nfl
"I don’t have the numbers but what were their respective air yards? Brees’ overall completion percentage has been up the past two seasons compared to his average.

"Album bonanza week review #1: Full of Hell - *Weeping Choir*

These guys have been one of my favorite extreme metal acts of the past several years, blending harsh noise with an outrageously heavy blend of powerviolence, death metal, and grind. Unfortunately, this new album feels more or less exactly the same as 2017's *Trumpeting Ecstasy* but more boring in nearly every way. The only track that really grabbed me was Armory of Obsidian Glass, which was more of a slow burning sludge track and was a nice change in pace for them. 

It's my least favorite album of theirs by a pretty wide margin. I wouldn't call it bad, but their sound feels stagnant now, and that's a shame because their albums are very short so it really shouldn't feel like this already. I'd like to see them use more noise elements than they do and go for a more abstract approach to their music rather than going full pummel all the time with the occasional noise track thrown in.",nfl
"Appreciate the Jets love, I know alot of Jets fans share the same optimism. I think Darnold showed he was more prone to throw it when he didn't know what to do (hence the interceptions) and Allen was more prone to run (hence the high rushing yards). I know comparing QBs isn't an exact science but kinda feels like how Goff and Bortles started out. Too many factors go into it but I feel like QBs that go to rush first don't fair as well as the ones that throw. But hey, Vick and Wilson both did great. Allen could definitely have the same success.",nfl
Why don’t you go ahead and watch Murray play. He gets a ton from him legs but he protects himself very well. Isn’t afraid to slide/avoid hard contact. Sure he could get hurt like any other qb can but I actually think it’s less likely for Murray to get hurt than non mobile qbs because of how good he is at avoiding contact.,nfl
"Yes and no. Catches are definitely important. More chances to move the team forward. Would you rather have one 20n yard catch on first down, or three 6 yard catches on 3rd down that move the chains? First down conversion rate is important here.

"I won’t argue against this but I’ll bring up another perspective. If the pats offense stays on the field and is able to put together long drives, it keeps the opposing teams offense off the field while tiring out their defense as well. In turn the patriots defense is better rested for when they have to take the field. This would enable the patriots defense to perform at a higher level.",nfl

"In defense of the Jets, they had Kirk take less to play elsewhere last year and Barr back out of a contract this year. They were probably right that they needed to overpay to get their guy. 

Also, a similar strategy did work for the Jags. They were a dumpster fire for years and overpaid Malik Jackson by a ton to come play for them. A couple years of great drafting later and Jackson was perhaps not a star player but a quality piece of a stellar defense. I could see Mosely fitting that mold.",nfl
Lamar Jackson fumbled 12 times and had only 1200 yds passing with 58% completion in 8 games. Sure he ran the ball solid but that’s not enough. He had a terrific defense and managed games and then we all saw how he really was in the playoff game when he fumbled 3 times and was terrible. Rosen is still the better qb and has loads more potential.,nfl
"David Moore sucks.

He had like 5 catches over the last half of his year. You may think his snap count went down. It didn’t. He just sucked.

EDIT: He had a solid game in Week 12 (bolstered by one big catch). Past that, he had a total of 4 catches while starting 4 of those 5 games. The guy can’t run routes, he’s never actually open, he’s just the guy Russ lobs it to. He had a few nice snags early but I think that’s the product of the luck of 50-50 balls.",nfl

"That's a good question. And my answer it probably yes. Because even if Rogers goes 12-0 and my backup goes 0-4, unless I've got a starting caliber QB on my bench I'm probably going to get knocked out immediately in the playoffs. It's like an eternal tease and totally worthless.

I'd rather have a crappy long term QB, accept it, and spend that money on the rest of the team.",nfl
"I still think there's a chance he's our guy, but I can't be mad at you for doubting it. That's a completely fair and reasonable take.

"The Patriots have always been a run first team. 

Run first doesn't have to mean a team runs the majority of the time. That's not practical in the modern NFL.

It's more about approach. The Patriots have always looked to run the set up the pass, particularly play-action. But Brady has talked extensively about how running on early downs opens passing options.",nfl
"I mean yeah, it's a passing league these days. Only 2 teams last season ran more than they passed the ball(SEA and TEN). Run-first doesn't necessarily mean you're running over 50% run plays, as weird as that sounds, just that you try to establish the run as the main threat of your offense. That said, we were still ranked 9th in % of offensive plays that were runs(45.4%), and I fully expect us to remain in the Top 10 with a massively overhauled receiving corps. Obviously we'll still go to the pass if we need to, but we are first and foremost gonna want to make defenses have to respect our run game.

This just kinda comes off as lazy analysis that he's trying to disguise as being smart and aware.",nfl
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.

People on this subreddit hate Tom Brady.

The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.

Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into football in the last couple years. So you never watched the GOAT in his prime.

And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: football isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""Pro Football Focus"" or ""DVOA"" I know they know nothing about football.

Brady's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the greatest QB ever, and the best player to ever play the game.

So when I hear somebody say that Patrick Mahomes is better than Tom Brady, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Brady in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched football for a significant amount of time, so I know that Brady is better.

You might be jealous of Brady's six rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest passer in NFL history, or whatever. Unless you're a 49ers fan who watched football in the 80s, or a Patriots fan who watched football in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win football looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.

This sub would make you think that Brady isn't even a top 100 player.

So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like Showtime Mahomes™, but leave the Brady talk to the adults. Fair?",nfl

"Baseball is unusual among major sports in that if you don’t understand the game really well it looks like nothing is happening.

&gt;I really still don’t know if I can do it.  There’s just something I don’t like.  And I don’t like where he went.  I especially don’t like how obvious Tennessee was in trying to get an RGIII haul for that pick.  If they really believed in Morcus, why would they put all that trade stuff in the media? (and it was obviously them doing it)  You have to listen, I guess.  But it didn’t seem like they were just listening.  It seemed like they were saying – “YO EAGLES, BROWNS, JETS, BEARS – look at everyone who’s interested!  And we’ll just take him if we don’t like your offer – call our bluff, watch!  So offer us more!”  Then they did call the bluff and, “damn, I guess we gotta coach this kid up – call the billboard company and get a picture of a duck.”  At that spot, its either 1000% sold on that franchise QB and you aren’t even thinking about anything else OR you want to trade the pick, and there’s some trepidation about taking the player.  Hmmm.  I think the Titans have that same trepidation I do.  Hmmm.   They convinced themselves it was worth the risk – like I want to predicting good things.  Hmmm.  It’s almost as if it’s up to Morcus himself to either prove his worth from here on out and his career could go either way.  Hmmm.  
&gt;  
&gt;I just can’t do it.  And part of it is last year – the truth is that I saw what I WANTED to see with Bortles and Manziel.  My notes had more negatives than positives for those two guys and I still didn’t pick busts.  I want to KNOW I have a franchise QB when I watch his tape.  I didn’t get that from Morcus.  I’ll say productive player – not a mega bust – but not a top-8 QB at any point.  Similar career arch to Alex Smith, but with much better stats throughout. ",nfl

"Charles had elite speed and vision. If there was a crease, crack or hole, he'd find it. He was also an extremely graceful runner, just no wasted steps. For as elusive as he could be he rarely ever went sideways, which is likely the reason for his unusually high YPC average.

"I mean, Kirk having a 2.0 TD/INT ratio against above average defenses isn't all that bad. It's better than Cam Newton, Matthew Stafford, Baker Mayfield, Derek Carr, Mitch Trubisky, etc. did for the entire season against both good and bad defenses.

And if Carlson could have made just one of his three game winning FG attempts in week two, we would have been 9-7 and in the playoffs. Sure some blame lays on Kirk but he was far from the issue last year. Our defense took a big step back from the year prior (statistically we were middle of the pack for the first 6-8 weeks until Zimmer simplified the playbook after overcomplicating it as a response to the NFCCG), we had a QB in his first year with the team, a god awful offensive coordinator that couldn't scheme around a bad offensive line to save his life (plus that awful offensive line couldn't block), and we had some weird stuff going on with the team (Sparano's death, Griffin's mental health stuff, etc.) that led to the downfall of this team. 

I'm not saying that we are guaranteed to make the playoffs because we're not. But I'm saying that our new OC looked decent the last three games last season, we hired Kubiak to help Stefanski build an offensive gameplan, one that fits the strengths of Kirk and our OL, and we've improved a bit on the OL while maintaining continuity from a personnel perspective.

"My dude, I teach college courses aimed at STEM kids where I try to teach them that people aren't numbers on a page. One of the core principles of my course is that math isn't logic. Just because you can prove a thing is mathematically valid doesn't mean it is an answer to something. Saying that Brady's adjusted ANY/A compares with his peers is not the same thing as saying he doesn't have an argument to be the greatest quarterback of all time. It shows us that Brady meets the minimum fucking threshold to be one of the best at his position, as does his longevity (which you yourself cited as unusually good) and his raw passing and touchdown numbers.

What makes the argument for Brady is all the shit your math can't quantify. The fact that he is mentally the best quarterback we have ever seen late in games, with a coolness under pressure no historical quarterback outside of maybe Montana could hope to emulate. That his best moments have come under the most intense pressure imaginable, and that when pushed, he has performed even better. That Tom Brady inspires literal, illogical fear in his opponents who either overcompensate for him because they are so desperate to beat him, or undercompensate because they are convinced they can't.

The fact that you are hanging on my response to an illogical point you made about GOATs at other positions that pointed out your argument was no less illogical than QB winz as evidence that somehow my argument is invalid is telling about your inability to see beyond the raw data in front of you and to craft it into meaningful information.

And by the by: OF COURSE WINS MATTER. The whole point of football is to win games. Literally, that is the point. And Tom Brady has won more games than anyone no matter what kind of team he has around him. This is part of his story and no amount of obfuscating about his raw efficiency can take away from the fact that he is the first quarterback you would want on your team if winning a football game was your priority.",nfl

So one day I’m at my cash register and Larry Fitzgerald walks up to me ready to pay for his stuff and I was pretty star struck in the moment because I didn’t know he was even in the store. It was just him too, he wasn’t with his family or anything. But as I was ringing in his stuff, I jokingly pointed to the section with all the Seahawks gear and asked him “you check out any of our cool Seahawks stuff?” And he shakes his head and says “I’ll check it out if I need to wipe myself after using the bathroom” and that made me burst out laughing because I never would have expected him to give a response like that.

"Way too much context required in football.
  
Two QBs could finish with the exact same stat line but if one guy's incomplete passes all come on 3rd downs and the other only throws a few incomplete on 3rd, the latter QB has done a better job helping his team win. TDs could mean a lot or they could mean next to nothing, because if a QB drives his offense down inside the 5 with his arm but the team rushes for the actual score, he's done a better job than a QB who dumps off a screen pass that a talented receiver takes 80 yards for the TD. The conventional stats are already weighted/manipulated in things like Passer rating and ANY/a, which are considered better indicators than basic stats themselves, but Passer Rating is based on a 40 year old formula created when completing even 60% of your passes was insanely tough and while ANY/a is my favorite single stat to use shorthand (it's one of the few statistics that factors in sacks and lost yardage along with yards/TD/Ints etc.), it has its own limitations too. 
  
Conditional stats will always tell a more full story. DVOA is calculated by success rate on plays, which is measured by a percentage of remaining yardage gained per down or per pass. EPA is similarly very contextual weights for situations based on likelihood of scoring. I don't know how you'd be able to factor these into whatever it is you're trying to do, but they're worth looking into.  
  
I also don't know if you didn't phrase it clearly, but the stats don't impact the QB, the QB (among many other factors including targets, OL play, defense, general scheme selection and more) impacts the stats, and passing stats are still uncertain ways to predict game outcomes. ANY/a differential (team vs team) is one of the best predictors of game outcome, but it's heavily tied to opponent performance as much as personal performance, and it only correlates with winning at a rate of (I'll try and find the source for you but this is off the top of my head from the last time I read about this) about 58%.",nfl

"I tend to think this is true, but Davis has a few things going for him that Sterling does not. He was an NFL MVP, two-time offensive player of the year, and a two-time Super Bowl winner, including being named Super Bowl MVP for the first of those.

"Footwork is hugely important especially in today's NFL where the pocket collapses in 3 seconds. But I think accuracy makes the QB. Arm strength is a close 3rd behind footwork, but with just an arm you can end up like Mallett. If Josh Allen had the accuracy of a top 10 QB, he would be a top 10 QB, maybe even top 5 if we're feeling hot takey. Accuracy will be what makes or breaks Jones' career. I think he can get there with Eli mentoring him and the coaching staff easing him in. But if Eli gets injured or something and they have to throw him into the fire week 2 or 3, I think he's just going to go down in flames. 

That said, everything surrounding Jones will be purely speculation until he takes a snap, so take everything you see with a grain of salt.",nfl

"Woodson wasn't a full time CB by 2009.

He lined up all over the place his entire career, but in 2008 (I think) he switched from being a CB who would occasionally line up at safety or LB to something more resembling a Swiss Army Knife DB.

Edit:

I never said CBs can't win the award.

I don't care about an award Revis didn't win 10 years ago.

I'm saying Woodson did not play the role we think of when we think of elite CBs when he won DPOY.

Woodson wasn't like Prime Time, Champ, or Revis by that point in his career. He was something different.

I'm weighing in on one aspect of a long 'conversation' between multiple people.

When we think of elite CBs, we tend to think of guys who spend the entire game shadowing the other team's number one WR.  Woodson wasn't that guy in 2009.  He was a playmaker.",nfl

"Figured out all the way to the super bowl huh? Lol but to respond to your last point McVay made obvious adjustments to his offense at the end of the year. Teams were playing deep and keeping everything underneath(bears, lions, etc). McVay responsed with less 3 wr 1 rb formations and brought in more tight ends. Basically said if you’re going to sit back I’m going to run it down your throat. Which worked til the super bowl.

"From 1970 to 2003 Miami only had two seasons below .500, which was illustrating my point that despite their lack of above .500 seasons dating back to 2003, they were relatively consistent in terms of finishing above .500 and making the playoffs. They had a dry spell in the late '80s with four straight seasons without a playoff appearance, but mostly finished 8-8 with the exception of one 6-10 season.",nfl

 Just because you have loud people screeching about the browns winning all the super bowls does not mean it's a consensus among the fanbase. Pretty much all of us long time browns fans are cautiously optimistic and just want the season to start.

"Well, also OBJ was a subject of trade rumors for I think 2 years prior up until he was dealt. He was with the organization for a long time. He plays a more valuable position. The extension was already a year in, no? He already played a year under his new deal. The Giants were entering a rebuild phase while the Jets are trying to climb out of one. Bell was signed three months ago, not a year. OBJ played last season and was a more proven commodity than Bell who sat out a year. Gettleman has been the GM for multiple seasons and we don't even have a GM right now. 

The two situations are very different outside the fact they involve NY teams.",nfl

So yeah, all other things the same, I'll take Peyton for that one game. Be it week 1, the Divisional Round, or the Super Bowl. Brady is still the GOAT though.",nfl
Packers added 4 defensive free agents and drafted defensive guys in first few rounds. That is a big improvement from last year. I agree that we need pass catchers and hoping one of the new guys can get better this year. Rodgers was hurt the last 2 seasons so dont give up on him just yet. I think we will make a run for it this year but in NFCN anyone can really be a 8-8 team.,nfl

"To me, stats like this show that while Brady is the most accomplished QB ever, he's not really the best.

And i don't want to sound like i think he's bad or something, because he isn't, he's great. I just think a lot of people regard him as the best ever, but I think he's just the most accomplished (which for a lot of people, is more important anyway).",nfl

"There's an ownership connection with the Steelers.

For years our team resembled the Ravens.

But lately, and you can search my history if you really want but we've been a year or two behind the Cardinals going down the same path for a few years now.

When they had Palmer they had no plan behind him, we had Eli with no plan. They had a ""QB Guru"" coach and put no resources into their offensive line as we hired Ben McAdoo (who isn't Arians don't worry, I'm not a moron) and watched our line go to absolute hell.) But their offense was essentially based on have a slightly above average QB and a great WR...that was us until we got rid of all our great WRs.

The Cardinals went out and drafted a RB who was going to change the course of their entire organization.

We now have two of their OLBs, a FS, and a DC. 

People are already asking if we will pull the same move of drafting another QB next year or the year after. That's insane. It's too early to get on board with that but I've been saying for a long time we were falling down the road of becoming the Cardinals. We are there. Perhaps even worse off. 

Even this year, I'm talking about both teams:

- Our Best WR is a slot WR over 30
- Our offense can only be as good as our RB
- ....unless our young QB is a stud
- Maybe our ""really just a big WR"" TE's will be big factors this year
- Last year we switched from a 3/4 to a 4/3 or vice versa but this year it's back to 3/4 for both teams
- 1 really good corner and a lot of young, untested corners opposite of him
- A new FS, hopefully he'll fit in

Honestly it was more of a feeling than anything and was especially true a few years ago when Palmer was still around.",nfl
Fitz is 100% a top 5 receiver of this century. The guy is as fast as a horse and has dominated the outside of the field throughout his career. He's had  1 decent QB his entire career and if he hasnt wowed you during games then you either haven't watched any of his games or are just ignorant of his talent.,nfl
"The consequence of not converting is much worse. Then you give the ball back to LA with a 1:12 in a one possession game. Making the field goal essentially ends the game  as well because it is unlikely for LA to score twice with the remaining time. If you miss the field goal you’re back to the same consequence of not converting the 4th. If at that point you end up losing the game, people will ask why you didn’t take the opportunity to score with a reliable kicker in a comfortable FG range. Kicking the FG is the safer option unless you have Cody Parky",nfl
"As much as I think Neocon and other internationalist types would want too, I strongly doubt it could happen. Invading Iran would have the worst elements of the Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan wars.

"While I wouldn't disagree with the assessment that Gronk's prime seasons are better than Antonio Gates prime seasons, I absolutely still think the Frank Gore comparison is pretty terrible.

Antonio Gates however has been a 3 times First All-Pro **(over Gonzalez and Witten in those years)**, 2 time Second All-Pro, went to the Pro-Bowl 8 straight years, currently has 116 receiving TDs which not only leads TEs but also ranks 7th all time for receivers in general, and is on the 2nd team for the NFL's 2000s All-Decade Team. Antonio Gates is pretty much a lock for the Hall of Fame and could possibly be a first ballot once he retires.

Witten may have averaged more yards per game but if you take out Gate's 2018 season then he has had 114 TDs to Witten's 68 in the same time span since they both started in 2003. I kinda understand the blocking debate but there probably isn't PFF data going back that far to quantify who was the better blocker.",nfl

However, since he did not even play in the game itself my position is that he wants to very much earn it by playing in the Super Bowl and being part of the effort in a direct way to win the actual game.  

Earl Morral has been on 3 Super Bowl winners but no one really thinks of him as winning 3 Super Bowls, else he would be up there among the greats when mentioned as QB.

"That's a reason for him to not go top 3 overall, for sure. But he was 1.5 inches shorter than a QB who just put up one of the best seasons ever. 

And obviously it's not like he suddenly shrank before the combine- he had put up those record breaking marks while *already* being that height.

There's a pretty clear argument for Russell Wilson being the best player in college football back in 2011, but I'm not gonna lie and say they should have known he'd be the best of that class. There were concerns. 

But if being an unremarkable 28 year old, or being a mediocre college QB like Tannehill doesn't stop you from being a 1st round pick, then I don't see why being 23 and 1.5 inches shorter than one of the best QBs ever should stop you from being a late 1st.",nfl
"If you're under two minutes and have all of your downs, you can effectively run the clock down just by doing nothing. You don't need to draw an unnecessary penalty.

If you're over 2 minutes, chances are the other team still has some times out and would have stopped the clock already, so maybe it's just not something that teams do?",nfl

"I don't know what we have at wide receiver. Dede Westbrook is good, but then you have four real wild cards:

- Marqise Lee has potential, but he does have a case of the dropsies, and is coming off of a torn ACL

- Keelan Cole has massive potential, as shown in 2017 and with [the greatest catch in Jags history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7cX9WRaWx0) in 2018. But he kinda fell off a cliff last year after that play, and I'm not sure why

- DJ Chark was our second round pick last year. Super fast, and an amazing gunner... but he did absolutely nothing positive at WR

- Chris Conley was signed in free agency

If all of them break out and live up to their potential now that there's actually someone who can throw a spiral playing QB, that's the best case scenario. Do I think it'll happen? No, but best case scenario is that it does.",nfl

"Myles Garrett put his hand on the ground for his first rep in team drills in his first NFL training camp in the summer of 2017. The Browns' No. 1 overall pick had been limited earlier in camp because of a high ankle sprain, so all eyes were on him. Garrett got to the quarterback, but it was the way he did it that left an impression on teammates. ""He ran an offensive lineman over with one arm..."" Browns defensive tackle Trevon Coley remembers, still amazed a year-and-a-half later. ""When he hit the dude, the first thing that hit the ground was the dude's head. We were all standing there saying, 'Oh my God.'""         

You shook my core
Stirred by your trance
Left me want wanting more 
After only a glance

Garrett knifed to the left of then-Jets guard James Carpenter in his first snap of his first regular-season game in October of 2017, and before Carpenter could turn his head around, he was past him and smothering quarterback Josh McCown.

Your smile made waves 
In the oceans of my mind
Your eyes made slaves 
Of this man you came to find

Garrett took a snap in September of 2018 with the Browns 32 seconds away from their first victory in nearly 21 months, a shark striking at the scent of blood. Rookie QB Sam Darnold was on the other side of scrimmage, desperately trying to bring the Jets back from a four-point deficit. Garrett tried sprinting to his left and, rushing upfield, freed himself from offensive tackle Kelvin Beachum, bringing down Darnold down by his heels.

Your beauty bounds above the rest
Leaving others in awe
You are simply the best
Anyone ever saw

Garrett came in from left end in December of 2018, powering Texans right tackle Kendall Lamm backward and then colliding with left tackle Julie'n Davenport a few feet behind quarterback Deshaun Watson. For a moment, it seemed, Garrett was lost in a mass of giants. And then an arm emerged from the chaos—Garrett's—dragging down Watson for a sack, with an assist from linebacker Joe Schobert.

You capture fools to kings 
Your love knows no peer
Put on this earth for many things 
But love is why you're here

At 6'4"", 272 pounds, Garrett has Instagram abs. He can jump higher than an NBA player (41"" vertical) and burst quicker than a jackrabbit (1.63-second 10-yard split). When the Browns made him the first pick of the 2017 draft, there was nary an argument. A generational talent is what scouts have called him.

And there's more.

As interesting as he is imposing, he dreams of stepping in the ring with WBC heavyweight champ Deontay Wilder—and of writing a book filled with his poems like the one above.

Quarterback-imperiling, guitar-strumming, game-plan ruining, rom-com watching, halfback destroying, nature-walk taking, offensive-lineman steamrolling, Anita Baker playing—he is part warrior and part bard.

But somehow, the hard edges blend into the softness as if there were no dichotomy in Myles Garrett.

         

The Warrior

It was downtime in the NFL, and Myles Garrett was hanging with friends from college. They were playing something called ""The Pain Game,"" in which cards are drawn to see how many pushups and situps each has to do.

As a result of one particularly unfortunate draw, Garrett had to do more than 100 consecutive pushups. By the time he was declared the ""winner"" of the game, he had done 564 pushups and 314 situps.

Two days later, he was still sore. Garrett is OK with pain, whether inflicting it or enduring it. He used to enjoy taping on boxing gloves, climbing between the ropes of a ring and sparring. Then it became difficult to find a willing opponent.

""Boxing is kind of like football in that you test each other's desire to be there,"" he says.

Someday, desires will be tested. For now, he hits the heavy bag, the speed bag and jumps rope.

He likes to train in different ways. The other day, it was soccer on the beach. Basketball was his first love and remains a passion. He could dunk when he was 12 years old, and he always has looked up to his older half-brother, Sean Williams, a former NBA player.

He recently caught an alley-oop pass and dunked with such ferocity that he shattered the backboard. The points he scored on the play won the game.

After posting a picture of himself beneath the mangled backboard, Garrett heard from new Browns coach Freddie Kitchens. The strong suggestion: Retire from basketball.

""All right,"" Garrett told him. ""I hear you loud and clear. I'll focus on other training. There are other ways to do it.""

It's all about being the best defensive end he can be. That explains why he works out twice a day—three hours first thing in the morning and three hours in the evening. And why he hasn't had a dessert in six years (since his last bite of his grandmother's chocolate cake). And why he doesn't drink soda. And why he's limiting pizza and pork to once a month.

When the Browns run sprints in practice, Coley says, Garrett runs so hard he nearly passes out.

The competitor in him can be traced his father, Lawrence, who refuses to lose. If they are playing a game of pool up to five and he is trailing, Lawrence will insist the game goes to 10. Then 15, and on and on.

His nerve comes from his mother, Audrey. When Garrett's brother, Sean, was accidentally kicked in the face by another boy after falling off a swing at school, Audrey went to school to check on him. When the other boy's father told her Sean needs to watch what he's doing, her reply was a right hook to the jaw.

""My mom gets aggressive,"" Garrett says. ""She has no problem throwing down.""

Her son is more even tempered but no less fierce. ""He got that dog in him—that inner dog,"" Coley says. ""Nobody gonna bully him. He doesn't take crap from anybody.""

That explains why teammates voted Garrett a captain in his second season. He has the respect of every corner of the locker room.

He has the respect of opponents and fans too. They voted him to the Pro Bowl after he had 13.5 sacks last season.  Garrett became one of only 15 pass-rushers in NFL history with 13-plus sacks in a season at the age of 23 or younger.

He is capable of much, much more.

""He has an enormous amount of potential,"" says retired offensive tackle Joe Thomas, Garrett's teammate in 2017. Citing Garrett's quickness, lower-body flexibility and strength, he adds: ""I've never played against anybody who was like him. Von Miller has the same bendiness, the ability to turn the corner. DeMarcus Ware reminds me of the way he turns the corner. But DeMarcus was 250 to 260 pounds. Von is small. Myles is 275 pounds. He's a big man.""

Garrett believes many more sacks are possible as his team evolves. With the acquisition of Odell Beckham Jr., more points—and more pass-rushing opportunities—could be forthcoming. There are reinforcements up front with the acquisitions of Olivier Vernon and Sheldon Richardson. And Garrett is counting on the change in the coaching staff to benefit him as well.",nfl
"you are claiming to know more then everyone whose job it is to cover the NFL and every other GM besides DG, that's literally what you are doing, everyone is in agreement that DJ would have been there at 17 besides DG and yet you and a handful of fans still don't believe anyone.

"To be honest it depends on what you're looking for.  If you're looking to go out drink, sit on some patios, party etc its a blast.  Wrigleyville alone has probably 30+ different types of bars.

"&gt; 3-13 is more likely than 9-7

As I cited, the odds makers disagree with you. And making that statement shows how little you understand where the Broncos stand in the league. That's a _really_ hot take and I'm pretty sure many others would back me up on that, from all fanbases. It's _hard_ to only win 3 games with decent FO/coaching staff/team talent (I won't say ""great"" on any account, and odds of the coaching staff being ""poor"" are much less than odds of the coaching staff being ""decent""). You really have to have a marriage of all 3 being ""poor"" to go 3-13 (look at the combination of dumpster fires that got AZ that record last season, and tell me with a straight face and not being disingenuous that the Broncos look at all like that team heading into 2019). Or you need to be actively tanking, which John Elway has and will never do. The fact that you're coming off of a 4-12 maybe makes 3-13 seem attainable for you. In fact, come to think of it, the Raiders are more likely to go 3-13 (-1 win) than 9-7 (+5 wins) based solely off of the numbers... but it seemed like Gruden was actively ""tanking"" to some degree, trading current talent for draft stock and picking up guys who wanted to get one more season before retiring, so even I would say that's pretty damn unlikely for the Raiders. Nonetheless, I can only conclude that you're [projecting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection) to make a statement like that coming off your 4-12 season.

Anyway, last year, we were 6-10 while losing more 1-score games than we won (Raiders were even if I counted correctly), so statistical regression would put us up to 7-9. Extremely poor on-field coaching decisions could be attributed for 1 (for sure) or (arguably) 2 or 3 losses. (Meanwhile, Vic Fangio was the guy Brian Billick turned to to help make situational calls when he was DC in BAL. Not a guarantee he gets all the situational on-field calls right, but some evidence to indicate after 30 years in the league he knows what he's doing.)

Others besides Kollmann said that Munchak was an absolute coup for the Broncos overall, but I clearly remembered that source and thought I could dig up where he said it on twitter easily (but alas, I couldn't find it, fuck social media search functionality).

&gt; first year head coach

I agree that's an unknown, but Fangio is clearly a in a different league of ""unknown"" (~30 year coach in the NFL with success in pretty much everything he did) vs. the other first-year HC's like Kingsbury and Taylor. And all Fangio has to be is ""better than Vance Joseph"" to be an upgrade, so...

&gt; bad offense

No disagreement there. We had a bad offense last year (and the year before, and before, and ...), and we're counting on Flacco being _at least_ in his early-season / pre-injury form from last year plus our young WR's to get better _and_ a first-year OC to scheme better than Musgrave did last season in order for our offense to make any significant strides forward. Lindsay coming back from a bad wrist injury is also probably a ""must."" So while our offense would be hard pressed to get much worse (just because it was so bad already), it'll also be hard pressed to get much better.

&gt; bad OLine

Denver's line was mediocre to above average in run blocking and below average in pass blocking in my opinion, but depending on the [source](https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/pro-2018-nfl-offensive-line-rankings-all-32-teams-units-after-week-17) doing the assessment, Denver was better than the Raiders or [much better than the Raiders](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/ol) and that's before Munchak, James, and Risner entered the picture for us (we did lose Paradis, which is unarguably a setback assuming he comes back in full (for him) health next season). Obviously y'all have your own ""projected improvements"" in personnel, but last I checked, Tom Cable is running your line over there, consensus to be one of the worst O-line coaches in the NFL (while Muchak is widely considered top-2 with alongside Scharnecchia) so....

Anyway, it's a ""whatever"" situation, we can argue 'til we're blue in the face, and while it's clear to me that you lack depth in your football analysis, random chance could make reality align more closely with your predictions than mine; we'll only know when 16 games have been played.",nfl
"Yes and no. I think the run of injuries and Michel/Burkheads injury history meant the team brought Bolden and then Harris is partly as injury insurance, but Harris also brings a unique skillset to the table with a good amount of speed to go with his big frame and soft hands to boot. Harris is more of a hybrid power back whereas Michel is a slashing one cut runner who almost always picks the right hole. That they are both excellent pass blockers is nice icing on the cake.",nfl
"Sure I can. When I say a starting QB, I mean a legitimate starting QB, one who can make a team a playoff contender. Smith turned out ok after about half a dozen years of learning the position.

"This list is actually pretty dumb, Glennon was terrible but Tannehill Glennon and Bridgewater look bad now in comparison because the game has changed. The reason you're saying the QB pool is deep is because on paper they should all do well but in reality, their stats don't stand alone, they have to perform against each other and that determines who is good and who is bad. 

Carson wentz might put up 4000 yards 28 TDs and 6 INTs and if you compare that to any of those guys you listed, that looks fantastic and you'd say ""wow those old guys really sucked!"" but if Carsons 4000 yards is the 4th lowest in the league he'd be trash. Get what I mean?

"IMO 75% of fantasy football is lineup changes, waiver wire pickups, and being healthy. Everybody has a top tier running back or wideout or QB unless they get hurt, the real things that wins you games are the RB2's and WR2's and flex spot that change from week to week based on matchups.

Basketball: 82 Games

NHL: 82 Games

I don’t think 16 vs 18 is that big of a difference relative to the other leagues. And if MLB, NBA, and NHL were capable of driving up ratings on a shorter season, then they would be more successful in their playoffs, draft, etc. when the length of the regular season is irrelevant.

"Sure, it happens, Tom Brady was a sixth round pick.

There's nothing in Jones' college production that justifies a first round pick, though.  Regardless of how poorly his receivers and offensive line played, he still didn't play well - the ACC is not a defensive joke like the Big 12, but it's also not the SEC.

"Kelce also had much more opportunities than Kittle though, he ended up running almost 100 more pass routes than Kittle, 487 vs 570, if you're running more routes than it's going to be easier to rack up volume yardage.  Kelce did have 5 more TDs for sure, but Mahomes had 105 pass attempts in the red zone to the Niners 75 attempts, which puts some perspective on their 10 vs 5 TD difference.  Not to mention that in the constrained red zone, it's even more important that there are competing targets for the red zone so the defense can't more easily lock down on one player.

And I agree that double coverage isn't used as much as it's referenced, but less strict double coverage is still effective, with deep safeties shading over to help out on Kittle and the other S or LB that's on him.  And that's something they can't really do when Tyreek Hill is streaking down the field on the other side.  It's purely logical that having someone with Tyreek Hill's game breaking speed on your offense is going to help your other weapons produce, and the Chiefs obviously threw it enough where they weren't eating into each others targets more than they helped each other out.  And Kittle did have Shanahan, which was a huge boon for him, but Kelce also had Reid, probably the best offensive mind of the millenium, so that's not really an advantage Kittle had over Kelce.

The main advantage between the two is that Kittle had Mullens and Beathard for almost the entire season, whereas Kelce had MVP Mahomes, which is just a monumental difference as receivers.  Even the relatively QB proof WRs like Adams and Hopkins showed very noticeable differences in production when they went from Hundley -&gt; Rodgers and Hoyer/Mallett/etc. -&gt; Watson (even if we forget the extreme jump from Osweiler to Watson).  It's undeniable how big of an effect that gives, and there were wide open Kittle streaking down the field shots missed by Mullens that absolutely would have been made (and were made with Mahomes to Kelce/Hill) by a much better QB, that would've added 50 yards and a TD on just one catch.  And those are just the blatant, easily noticeable drawbacks of having a 2nd/3rd string QB.

I do agree that the 49ers offense wasn't complete shit, but our WR situation around Kittle definitely was, and our QB situation was easily bottom 10 and arguably top 5.  We were buoyed by Kittle, our bookend tackles, and pretty great RB play, but the latter 2 aren't the best positions to provide support to Kittle.",nfl
"Let me explain like this. Top 5 when there had been 8 unanimously considered as great at said position is comparable to top 20 RBs since there are 32 in the HoF. Inderstand my logic now?

This is not driven solely by Brady or Rodgers. Its driven by everything people know about football being ignored for the purpose of creating a list that enables people like yourself to claim the moral high ground. 'you have to have a truly high Footballing IQ to appreciate this list'.

It's absolutely bollocks to claim these are the top 100 players in the NFL if you're ignoring positional importance, difficulty and team context as some rankers have been claiming. This isn't solely driven by people wanting to see Brady or Rodgers higher and to claim that it is, is a disservice to those of us who have genuine gripes with how this list has been pulled together.",nfl

"Blinking isn't a worry, they put a device on your eyelid that keeps it held open during the procedure... not entirely unlike [A Clockwork Orange](https://media.giphy.com/media/uVOTxMagGsgXS/giphy.gif).

Here is how the whole procedure went for me:

* They give you a valium about 20-25 minutes before the procedure to help relax you.

* They lay you on the table and put numbing drops into your eye, then they slide you under the laser machine.

* One eye gets covered in an eyepatch, then they use some sort of tape to hold your other eye open. Then they put in the spreader device on your eyelids to keep it held open.

* The surgeon tells you to look at a red light. They press something down on your eye, which exerts some pressure (to hold it in place, I think. It's kind of uncomfortable, but not awful). This is held for 20 seconds that they count down while an incision/flap is made in the cornea.

* The cornea flap is pulled back and your vision goes black (that's is the unsettling part). For maybe about 5-10 seconds or so all you can see are some vague red and green lights among the blackness while the laser does its thing. You can smell burning flesh at this point, but that didn't really bug me.

* The corena flap is replaced and your vision comes back crystal clear. This next part made me think of being in a car wash when they are drying your windshield off, but instead of looking out of the windshield it is your own eye: They squirt a bunch of clear liquid over your eye and use little swab-like tools to rub and smooth it out and reposition the cornea flap.

* The process is then repeated on the other eye.

The only thing I felt was the pressure during the 20 second countdown for each eye.


For about 2 hours afterwards your eyes burn pretty bad once the numbing drops wear off and you are constantly producing tears (I felt [like this](https://media3.giphy.com/media/JwhcdSm232Ynu/giphy.gif)). Kind of like sitting around a bonfire and the smoke is constantly blowing in your eyes. They gave me a high dose benadryl as a sleep aid and told me to take a nap when I got home, which I did off and on for about 3-4 hours. After that they felt fine and I could see - just kind of dry and scratchy like I had been wearing contacts for too long.

Today, my vision has been pretty great and should only get better as my eyes continue healing/adjusting to their new shape.",nfl
"That was a team exception, rather than the rule change (which I guess was changed in 2004)

&gt; Exceptions

&gt; Third, a team may exhaust the available numbers for one position, and thus have no choice but to assign a different number to a player. This was more frequent prior to the 21st century when numbering rules were more strict; for example **until 2004** both wide receivers and tight ends were required to be between 80-89 and under modern offenses, it is likely that teams would have more than 10 such players. The addition of the 10-19 range for wide receivers and the 40-49 range for tight ends has reduced these problems.

"He wasn't a problem, he played fine. Our problem was an OC with his head up his ass and a bad and injured oline.

Why are you so obsessed with him? Seems very odd to hate a guy this much that's not in your division or even in the AFC. Especially for a team with a long history of garbage at QB that rivals the Vikings. Kirk would be a vast improvement over what he Bills have had for the last 20 years.",nfl

If they were concerned about Cincy or Miami taking a QB they wouldn't have traded out of 10. And, even if they did take a QB then whatever they have Flacco and can take a stab in a later round or wait until 2020 to make a move.

After their new pick at 20, there's literally no team between them and their original 2nd round pick that would take a QB, and with no RBs/WRs/CBs/Safeties taken as of 20 there would probably be a run on them.

They actually traded with Cincy for the very next pick in the 2nd round so obviously Cincy wasn't in on Lock, and then Miami was the only one behind them. I figure that the only team they were worried about was Miami so they traded up from their new '2nd' 2nd from Pittsburgh. Miami may have been in Rosen contingent on Lock being unavailable in Round 2, further evidenced by them trading back out of their original spot. Or just for value, who knows.

You have to have teams from 3 different divisions in this scenario, but how the NFL schedule works is like this:

6 divisional games 

4 games against a full division from the other conference

*One full division from in your own conference* 

The team from the remaining two same-conference divisions that finished in the same spot as you the prior season. 

The part I put in italics is the reason it doesn't work. For example this season the entire NFC South plays the entire NFC West and the entire NFC North plays the entire NFC East. Out of those two groupings of 8 teams it is only possible for one team each to go undefeated, so a max of two per conference per season who would both get byes.",nfl

Apparently in these rankings, you've somehow ranked each player relative to their peers in the same position, QB1 - QB5, SS1 - SS5, FS1 - FS5, etc and then randomly took a few from each bucket?

You can't mention the Vikings QB carousel without mentioning the OC carousel. Kirk Cousins was a good signing if you want him to support a top 5 defense and rushing game. Kirk Cousins was a bad signing if you want him to throw it 50 times a fucking game in a shit game plan. I think I saw Dick Nosed DeFillipo had him in shotgun something fucking nutty like 78% of the time when Cousins is known to play better under center. Also the complete lack of play action for a QB clearly established as a PA QB was baffling. I really think the volume stats go down but the efficiency stats go way up. Making Kirk even more polarizing. Vikings best shot at success is with a balanced and efficient offense that might not produce a 4000 yard 30 TD QB.  Which isn't in line with what fans expect a qb making 28 mil gtd to produce.,nfl

Compare that to even a guy in his Era who got in the HoF Leroy Kelly and Kelly had about 1000 more yards and 37 more TDs. So how Floyd got in to the HoF is beyond me.",nfl
"A rookie is also an adult man who can take a joke. The guy is a scout, who would take that comment seriously? Giving each other shit is a part of football culture, and that scout likely feels like he is ""one of the guys"" since he isn't in a position of power over that player.",nfl
"Joekel was like one of those Aaron Curry ""safest player in the draft."" That was such a shit draft too. For awhile he was supposed to go one overall and we probably would have grabbed Eric Fisher. I think the Chiefs realized he sucked and passed on him.

He was one of the more bizzare busts because he was supposed to be such a great prospect. And he wasn't even serviceable. He just straight up sucked and I think a lot of people have forgotten about him",nfl

"The biggest thing that can propel the Bears to truly an elite team is Mitch's progression. If he plays the way he did last year they still probably win 10 games but him elevating his play can mask some of the regression on defense and make the Bears serious contenders. 

Two things: 

* Mitch was learning a very complex offense last year. One that even Alex Smith said took him 2 seasons to learn. Mitch will know it better this year. 

* The biggest thing with Mitch is being able to go through his possessions better. A lot of times last season he would just know where he wanted to pass the ball before he even dropped back and would stare down his target. This lead to him trying to force balls into tough windows or also missing other open receivers. I swear last year Taylor Gabriel went unnoticed 6-7 times after he had just burned his man on a fly route. 

Trubisky has elite tools. If he can make that next jump the Bears offense will be very scary. And the defense will be scary as well because they will be well rested.",nfl
"Gronk, Gates, Witten, Gonzalez, Graham and Vernon Davis were pretty indisputably better from 2010-2012  
    
Heath Miller and Greg Olsen were much more well rounded.  
  
My biggest gripe with him as a player was that he was always injured, dealing with nagging hamstring issues for basically his entire brief career. Because of that he was outproduced by guys like Brent Celek and Brandon Pettigrew and had comparable production to Jermaine Gresham and Dustin Keller.  
  
I feel like I hear a very wide range of opinions about Hernandez and the highest ones are always through a scope of ""if he stayed in New England and played up to his potential,"" but that's a highly improbable series of events even in the world of hypotheticals. Super interesting offensive weapon, hard to argue he was a great TE or player.",nfl
"So goddamn dumb. I haven't been anti-Raiders at all since Gruden took over but that alone might be enough to flip me. Getting rid of Osemele for a fifth-round pick, keeping Tom Cable after virtually anywhere he's gone the O-line has collapsed, and now bringing that nutcase into a room with rookies taking their cues from vets?

That game SHOULD have been won by the Burfict interception with 2 minutes left. The Steelers were still at the 40 yard line with 15 seconds left even AFTER Burfict's penalty. Thr D had the Steelers on 4th down with 40 seconds left and gave it up. Clearly he made a big mistake but it was not nearly half the reason why we lost that game.",nfl
"It was pretty epic. He also once held up a sign that said, ""It's all about the nipping"" and had it pointing toward my high school crush, whose breasts were rather large. No one else noticed since we were watching a movie in class and he made sure to point it in our direction. 

He also signed my yearbook, ""Keep staring at *girl's* tits!"" When it came time for her to sign my yearbook, I scrambled and made sure she signed it on another page. Total close call.",nfl

"The coaching staff often has a lot to do with the draft. They pick the players that work well for their scheme based on workouts and visits and they move up and down the draft board heavily based on what the coaching staff say. That’s why the internal draft boards vary so significantly between the draftniks and the teams. They may not have final say but if it’s between say two defensive players on the board and the coach says they think x player fits better than y player and that they would rather have x player, then managers would be making a huge mistake to take a guy who won’t be used well or will butt heads with the staff.",nfl

"I do.  My desire is purely selfish, I want more football.  BUT obviously the players need to be taken care of to set this up.  Expand the roster to allow more depth, increase the salary cap and get the players more money. 

Existing contracts should not be stretched out over 18 instead of 16 but added to, if that makes sense.  So like if you were making 1.5m per game, you should still make that.  You just make 3m more this year.

A 2nd bye week totally makes sense to me too.  In fact you could even do something like an ""all star break"" and have a week where all 32 teams are off (as the 2nd bye, still have shuffling bye weeks as is) Maybe do the pro bowl that week?  Split pro bowl voting up and do it twice a year and use aggregate results? I dunno.

He used to coach at my college and he told the D-line his motivation was to make it to the league so when he finally did make it, he didn’t set up new goals for him to achieve.

"So I just read a different article about the Dubai recording, so I need to edit the timeline.

[This article in the Kansas City Star](https://www.kansascity.com/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs/article229721354.html) says the recording was actually made in early-March.

This would place the recording happening sometime before the March 14 call to police and after the March 5 call to police. That makes me wonder a few things:

1) How did the police not have it? They supposedly subpoenaed the phones. Maybe she deleted it?

2) What happened on March 14 exactly to make another report filed?

Or maybe the police did have the audio and that is why Hill had a no contact order? But if that's the case, then why was the investigation re-opened after the recording aired?

With this information it also means that the friend of Espinal for whatever reason wanted Hill charged and believes Espinal to be in danger.",nfl

"I love the analysis on the Broncos picks, but it seems most analysts/talking heads/youtubers don’t pick up on why we probably brought Justin Hollins in (it’s ok tho because at the end of the day he’s a 5th rounder). Justin Hollins is tall, fast and overall a freaky athletic player (6’5” 250 lbs 4.50s 40 time 36.5” vertical) and played meaningful snaps at ILB. Two of the biggest problems for the Broncos last year was EDGE depth and ILBs in coverage. I think Fangio has a plan to really utilize him, especially at ILB to help covering TEs.",nfl
"It wasn’t just Jarvis Landry. Jay Ajayi and Jordan Phillips hate him too, but you could probably make the excuse that they didn’t like him because they weren’t getting more playing time which is fair I suppose.

But other reports state that Drake was demanding a trade if Gase wasn’t fired, Ju’Wuan James would refuse to sign with Miami if Gase stayed (obviously he left anyway), and that team leaders (reportedly Frank Gore and Cameron Wake) all said that they’d leave if he stayed. They left anyway but that’s more likely because of the youth movement Flores is trying to bring in.

Some defended him like Stills, Albert Wilson, and Tannehill, but Gase very much seems like the kinda coach that has “his guys.” If you’re one of his guys, he’ll go to the end of the world to defend you (happened with Tannehill where he blamed most of his shortcomings on the rest of the team), but if you’re not, it seems like he doesn’t care.

"I think NFL fans get confused because in the NFL the only purpose is to win the championship and all 32 teams have a relatively equal shot at this. In college 90% of teams know they aren't going to be able to compete with Bama or Clemson for the title.

 For most teams a season is successful if you make it to a decent bowl game and beat your biggest rival.  Even if you're not a top 5 program how can you say beating your rival especially if you're the underdog isn't exciting.  

And don't get me started about how college rivalries are much better than NFL ones, these teams have been playing each other for over 100 years to me the rivalries just feel a lot more deep and less forced than most do in the NFL.  Don't get me wrong the NFL has great historic rivalries such as Bears Packers but a few years ago people kept trying to hype up Seahawks and Niners as this big rivalry when the history just wasn't there.  

Overall I do enjoy watching NFL football more than college but college has a much more natural passionate feel to it while the NFL sometimes can feel kind of lifeless and corporate.",nfl

"Well to be completely unbiased, I have no idea what to make of the Jags. I think our OL looks to be much improved, our QB should be better, and I like the TE we drafted as a mismatch receiver. The only real hole in our roster is safety, but from what I’ve gathered, Harrison and Wilson should be good enough. We could be really good or bad, but I think we’ll finish 3rd at worst, and possibly 1st if Foles and our defence can play at a high level. 

The Texans I think will rank last because they didn’t do enough to address the OL (IMO) and I really felt they reached for their first round tackle. Titans and Jags have killer pass rushes, so that doesn’t bode well for Watson having much time to throw. He’s been Houdini in the past but it’s not sustainable in this division. 

On defence the Texans took a step back in the secondary. It still matches up well within the division but it doesn’t match up with their schedule. 

They have a far tougher schedule than anyone else in the division.

* Jags
* Colts
* Texans",nfl

"Who on the 80s 9ers was poached from other teams?

You focusing on the blow out SB but look at who the 49erd played in the NFC playoffs and who was in their division. The AFC was awful for most of the 80s.

You are also acting like building a strong team year after year through the draft with no FA is easy. It isn't when draft order is determined by record with the best teams choosing last.",nfl
"It was such a shitty 1st overall pick though.  The draft was weak enough that no teams really felt like moving up so trading back wasn't a possibility.  

Of course we know now that there are several studs on that draft list and hindsight is 20/20, but I always roll my eyes when his name is mentioned during a game because it's never good.

Am I being irrationally harsh?  Yes.  Do I care?  No.

Mahomes makes up for the massive disappointment, obviously.",nfl
"Because the pattern is already broken. All of those guys came in as rookies and absolutely bombed. Baker came in as a rookie and now holds the rookie passing TD record.

The other improvements the team made are just the cherry on top.",nfl

It does also note that other teams -- including Philly and Chicago -- *receive* payment from rehab centers as sponsorship, rather than paying a market rate, so you could make the argument that ""market rate"" should consider what other teams pay / what other teams *get* paid, but that starts to get real in the weeds concerning team finances in a way that I don't think the owners or the Union really want.",nfl
"I think Rodgers tries to bail himself out with athleticism too often, though, even causing the new QB roughing rules we saw after his collarbone break.

If you leave the pocket you're allowed to get rocked, also you're literally scrambling AWAY from the protection your O-line is providing. Russel is probably a bigger offender of this, though, where he would run out of perfectly forming pockets rather than stepping up meaning the entire defense just gets to go around the O-line and a ridiculous scramble begins.",nfl
"Sigh. You’re not in an accounting position I hope. His cap hit is 8mil this year. So you need to add that 8 mil to 21mil and you get 29. Obviously these are rough numbers and it’s overly simplistic but you can see how we are in the ballpark now. One or two restructures gets us to the 30+ range. Again, these are rough numbers and the team had an option for next year, so idk if it happens this year or not, but that’s why you’re getting downvotes. You need to subtract his current cap hit because the 8mil caphit goes out the window if he resigns.",nfl
I’m sure top tier defensive guys will be left off in favor of some QB who is like the 15th best QB or something like that. Remember they put Manning on after 2015 and had Jimmy G over Smith last year. The players are handed a sheet of paper and take about 15 minutes to write down names. So it’s just a popularity contest really.,nfl
"Yeah, you're really missing my point. 

I'm not saying the severity was the same, you seem to be stuck on that. I'm saying the reason Vick is viewed as a good story is he served a punishment outside of the football realm. I made no mention of one's crimes being more heinous than the other. Just the way the people view it and why it's considered a ""feel good"" story. 

Also to speak to your point of Hunt's most likely punishment, it's all conjecture. Unless you were 100% privy to the details of the case (which you weren't) you can't say for certain what the outcome would be. You can use like cases as a reference, but speaking with authority on it is just flat out incorrect.

Not trying to rustle anyone, just pointing out the difference in how people view the two cases.",nfl
"I’m not speaking for all e-cigs, but Juul pods contain: glycerol, propylene glycol, nicotine, benzoic acid, and food-grade flavoring. All these ingredients have significant research and are shown to be non carcinogenic.

&gt; it is difficult to know exactly what chemicals are in an e-cigarette because most products do not list all of the harmful or potentially harmful substances contained in them. Some products are also labeled incorrectly.

If there are carcinogens in the product, it’s be because of this point. But Juul is head and shoulders the biggest brand in the market and is facing potential severe regulatory control from the government, so I doubt they’d risk having unlisted ingredients. They went so far as to stop selling fruity or sweet flavors in store, without government influence, to make it harder for kids to get ahold of them (all in the name of self-preservation, I would imagine).

It’s in no way a healthy habit, I just don’t think cancer is something people need to be worried about if they’re sticking to good brands. Lung irritation and being memed on seem to be the biggest side affects.",nfl

"I saw Ndamukong Suh at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",nfl

"I’m looking solely at the modern game, so QBs, WRs, LT/RT, EDGE, and CBs are at a premium. With that in mind:

Current: Beckham Jr, Ward, Garrett, Bitonio, Landry 
Former: Kozar, Thomas, Schwartz, Sheard, Mack

From the current roster I wanted Beckham and Landry as a good 1-2 punch on the outside. Denzel Ward as a dominant cover CB, Garrett as a game wrecker at DE, and Bitonio has been an elite guard his entire career, which will help our QB stay healthy.

Kozar is probably the best QB in Browns history. I like Mayfield a lot, and Graham was the most winning QB of all time. But I don’t think Graham is the best for today’s nfl. I also value getting after the QB, and I expect to run a 4-3 base. Sheard was always underrated in Cleveland and has been an integral part of both the Patriots and Colts defenses. I think he would benefit greatly being across from Garrett. Thomas, Schwartz, and Mack are obvious choices to me as they were perineal pro bowl players at LT RT and C. I also considered several CBs including Joe Haden, and Winnfield. I did not consider Safeties, LBs, DTs, or RBs including Jim Brown because I don’t value RBs in today’s NFL.",nfl

"So her net is less than what Russ makes in one year. My point still stands. What he made in the past is pretty irrelevant to their current net worth. Which is what I was talking about.

My point is that Russ is worth a lot more than Ciara now so it would be stupid for him to take a pay cut. It's not even close to the Tom Brady situation and never was or will be.

Nice sneaky edit there. Removing the hilariously out of place ""WRONG!"" Classy. And again, my point still stands. He's worth a shit ton more and it's gonna keep growing. She'll never make enough money for him to take a pay cut",nfl
"Brees wasn't making nearly as much in the mid 2000s and took longer to reach the same market Brady was hitting. Since 2013 their respective total cap hits is:

Brees: 120 million

"We have an incredible rotation right now. Vernon with Ogbah and Avery is a decent squad, I don't think it would be a painful falloff without Myles in the mix.

 Joe Schobert is the one that hurts the most to lose on defense. The LBs are the weakest unit on the team, and Joe's the one who holds them together on the field.",nfl
"The PD drop from '07 to '08 wasn't even that much less than for the Colts from '10 to '11 though, when the Colts lost 8 wins.

You have to remember that the '07 team was *so* good that there was room to get a lot worse without even shedding all that many wins.

Also the Pats' schedule in '08 was extremely easy, while their 07 schedule was slightly harder than average.

Also Matt Cassel, for all his flaws, was better than a lot of backup QBs.",nfl
"The problem is the voting criteria. Half the voters are voting for career legacy and half are voting for whose the best going into next season.

It's just a bad/unclear voting format.",nfl
"He should be behind Brees and Mahomes. I'd even argue he should behind Rothlisberger, Rivers, and Luck. All of them had great seasons. But 111?! Which Guards stood out so well? Which WRs were so much more important. His stats sucked but if everything they were saying is true ""Gronk is a shell""; ""The Pats have no WR"", ""You're too old"".  Its a huge over correction. Gilmore and Trey Flowers are the only other Patriots who should probably be on that list. Because they are the only two I can think of that deserve to be ranked higher than Brady for level of play. I can't think of 3 people on every team who would be better than brady and that would put him at worst at 97 (Which putting Brady in the bottom half makes sense to me. I'd put him roughly 7-10 of QBs that year which a QB should generally be in each 1-10 meaning he'd probably fall out around 70-99.)

We need to develop a better way next year. I am not a perfect elevator of every position (so I do not think I would be a good grader) but I would be interested in generating the process to make it closer to perfect.",nfl
"Hey, it's not the issue I'd pick to make a stand on, but it's the centerpiece issue party leadership is focusing on at the moment. I'd much rather they do what the majority of the 2020 candidates are doing and pressing the administration on the other issues they ran on in 2018 (because no matter how many times you say it, ""Give us subpoena power so we can do everything we can to get rid of Trump"" was definitely a major campaign pitch in 2018), but this is the fight they're picking right now. And they're saying ""Look at all these crimes and cover-ups, I sure wish someone with power would do something about them!"" How can the electorate trust Democrats to fight for them, when they won't even fight for themselves?

I understand the urge to punt to the voters, but that's 18 months from now. Not even using the full extent of their power to publicly litigate and underline these crimes and cover-ups not only leaves them unpunished, but introduces reasonable doubt in the mind of the electorate that Trump's been right about being unfairly treated this whole time.

Unrelated, are /r/politics types the online leftists and left wing of the party you go on about all the time? Because the online left has been dismissive of the Mueller investigation/Russiagate stuff for pretty much its entire run, and generally feel that impeaching Trump is a liberal fantasy.",nfl

"**21. Tennessee Titans
Jabari Zuniga, DE, Florida**

Zuniga's 11 TFLs and 6.5 sacks sound even better when you remember that 2019 first-rounder Jeffery Simmons ought to be healthy and ready to make plays on that line alongside him.


**22. Indianapolis Colts
Henry Ruggs III, WR, Alabama**

And the entire AFC South collectively shudders at the thought of having to slow Andrew Luck, T.Y. Hilton, Parris Campbell and Ruggs. This burner out of Bama scored 11 times in 2018.

**23. Detroit Lions
Travis Etienne, RB, Clemson**

By the time you finish reading this sentence, Etienne will have scored three touchdowns. He popped off 24 of them last season while rushing for 1,658 yards. Pairing him with Kerryon Johnson, the Lions' run game could do some damage.


**24. Dallas Cowboys
Alex Leatherwood, OT/G, Alabama**

Leatherwood has experience at both tackle and guard, and he started all 15 games for the Crimson Tide last season. Alabama gave up only 16 sacks over that span.


**25. Philadelphia Eagles
Trevon Diggs, CB, Alabama**

Diggs was limited to just six games in 2018 after breaking his foot. In addition to being a solid cornerback (one interception and six passes broken up in limited time last season), he has returned kicks and punts for the Crimson Tide in the past.


**26. Kansas City Chiefs
Jonathan Taylor, RB, Wisconsin**

Taylor and his 4,000-plus rushing yards over the past two seasons could be a final touch in making the Chiefs' offense unstoppable.


**27. Green Bay Packers
Tee Higgins, WR, Clemson**

Aaron Rodgers still needs help. And this 6-4, 200-pound receiver might be an answer. He had 59 catches for 936 yards and 12 touchdowns in 2018.

**28. Pittsburgh Steelers
Jared Pinkney, TE, Vanderbilt**

Fifty catches for 774 yards and seven scores is impressive production for a tight end. He could end up being the Steelers' new Heath Miller.


**29. Los Angeles Rams
J.K. Dobbins, RB, Ohio State**

While his yards per carry fell from 7.2 to 4.6 in 2018, Dobbins still broke 1,000 yards and scored 10 times. He is strong and athletic, and with Todd Gurley and Darrell Henderson, the Rams would have the NFL's most elite backfield.


**30. New England Patriots
Albert Okwuegbunam, TE, Missouri**

Albert O is a 6-5, 255-pound athlete with ability to create after the catch. He has 17 touchdowns over two seasons with the Tigers, and he could be a Rob Gronkowski replacement for Bill Belichick.


**31. Los Angeles Chargers
Nate Stanley, QB, Iowa**

The Chargers drafted Easton Stick in the fifth round, but he's probably not the heir to Philip Rivers' throne. Stanley has the tools to become a starting NFL quarterback, and I think his decision to get another season of college game experience will pay off. He threw for 2,852 yards, 26 touchdowns and 10 interceptions last season. This is going to be a very good quarterback class.


**32. New Orleans Saints
Bryce Hall, CB, Virginia**

Hall broke up 22 passes in 2018. He also had a pair of sacks and pulled in two picks. He'd be a good asset for the Saints to add to their cornerback group.",nfl
"I just think there’s no reason for them to rush this. Training camp is sill a ways off, and the season is even further. No reason to cut him before all the information is there and the NFL takes action. What if it (very unlikely) comes out that he didn’t hit his kid and he’s innocent? Then the Chief’s have cut him and somebody else can pick him up without an action from the NFL and no PR hit. There’s just no reason to do it until all the facts are out. The only way the Chief’s PR can take a bigger hit is if they try to extend him while this is ongoing (they won’t) and it comes out. They’ve already taken all the shit they’re going to get for signing him, rostering him and ignoring the warning signs that might have been there.",nfl

"I'll still say, worst case, it was definitely close between those two for a few years.  Nnamdi didn't have as long of a prime as Revis, though.  Just because Aso got old and slow and wasn't a good player anymore doesn't discount how good he was in his prime.",nfl

"You're looking at it all wrong. It was a horribly officiated game, but it wouldn't be a talking point if the ball was caught by Tate legitimately. Bad calls throughout a game are negated because the team that was on the other end usually has a chance to respond, same with the refs. This case, the team couldn't respond to the blown call as the game was over. If a holding call or DPI in the 2nd gets turned around, who knows if it affects the game later on. Even so, you can't prove it. The fail mary though? I point to that and say ""yep, cost the Packers the game.""",nfl
"Stafford had every chance to avoid that playoff game at cowboys, and could have hosted a playoff game if he beat the Packers in week 17. 

&gt; Would the Jaguars have gotten that far, or farther, with Stafford or Dalton?

I would take Stafford over Bortles and Goff but I have seen this guy for the past 10 years consistently fall short in big moments in big games. So while I think if you want to look at course of a long period Stafford might be better than these QBs, there are individual moments where I feel Stafford wouldn’t have won the Rams or the Jaguars the game like goff or bortles did

For example, we look at that divisional round game against the steelers and Jags defense was getting shredded but Jags still won because Bortles kept making plays. That same season, Stafford played the Steelers team at home and struggles to put up 15 points. Obviously, its hard to compare games like that but that’s a massive difference. 

However, the biggest problem I see with Stafford is that he eats too much cap and is mediocre. Mediocrity is worse than being complete shit in the nfl, you get punished for being good in the nfl, and you get rewarded for being bad but when you are mediocre you stay mediocre. Lions fans don’t seem to realize that sometimes to take 3 steps forward you need to take a step back. Chiefs are a prime example of that, they realized Alex Smith was good but not good enough and made the call to get mahomes and reached the Afc championship game the first year mahomes started which they have not done with Alex smith in his tenure there. 

Lions fans ask “who is better that can replace stafford?” And I say that’s exactly why Lions need to dump him and draft a new QB, you can’t win the lottery unless you buy lottery tickets and Lions are not buying lottery tickets because of Stafford. Lions could have drafted mahomes, Watson, Wentz, and probably more great future QBs that will come into the draft that will be passed on because of Stafford.",nfl

"They made some moves for the OL, plus they had a few injured players on the OL who will be back. They have a new qb friendly offensive system and new defensive scheme which is similar to what they had in 2017 I believe which fits there players more. Rosen is a qb where O LIne is a must while Murray theoretically can get away with a worse o line. Plus they added a couple dynamic play makers in Isabella and butler who fit perfectly into their new system.

Saying not much has changed besides getting a new qb is just lazy. Do I think they’re suddenly a playoff team? No, would I be surprised if that happened? No. I just wouldn’t bet on it. 

If I was a cardinals fan I would be optimistic for next year.",nfl

"We'll see how it plays out on the field but I can't remember the last time our front office seemed this functional.  Between Mayock/Gruden they seem to have a shared plan in building the roster through FA and the draft.  Even in interviews together they just seem to click, which you never saw previously with Reggie/Jon.  

On paper we've added a bunch of talent to the roster and filled most of our glaring holes.  I'm still worried about the pass rush but think it'll be loads better than last year, even if that's not saying much.

At the end of the day who knows how it'll all work itself out, but right now since we hired Mayock we've had a specific plan and it's been executed pretty smoothly so far.",nfl
"I'm so glad Trubisky has a real offensive coach to really help him develop to the best player he can be rather than watch that dinosaur of a head coach, run the ball 60 times a game and hope Trubisky being a 1st round talent is all it takes to become a franchise QB.",nfl

"Yeah there’s very few who don’t acknowledge Ben’s history there. Personally, that’s one of several reasons I don’t really like him.

"&gt;If you base the entire game off one player you’re a fool. It was Manning’s fault that he didn’t make the tackle after the Flacco bomb in double OT? 

No but it is Manning's fault that he turned the ball over three times.

&gt; Or Manning’s fault that his defense bombed in SB48?

Are we entertaining that Manning was even decent that game? He wasn't the reason they lost, but he has the most blame, without a doubt.

&gt;With that logic we can blame Matt Ryan for blowing a 25 point lead in his SB?

Uh yea kind of. Maybe not Ryan but the offense in general. The sack, fumble, and clock management he all shares responsibility in.",nfl

"I mean neither of them had much in the stat sheet. When you're looking at a pool that probably includes 200+ guys within reason, you have to have a starting point.

"I think people often over look the real advantage of Brady's contract.  
  
Firstly, it's not that far below expected market value.  
  
And second, BB has always prioritized depth over stars.  We seemingly never have much cap space every year, and that's because we're paying out a lot of smaller deals to high quality backups.  
  
So as the season wears on, and teams get more banged up, the Patriots just keep plugging in their #2s and seemingly get stronger as the season wears on.  
  
Game plan has a lot to do with this as well, but the Patriots are just a machine at this point.  
  
edit: Brady has a [27 million dollar cap hit this season](https://overthecap.com/position/quarterback/2019/), due to restructuring and what not.  That's 13% of NE's cap.  So yeah, not that far below market value.",nfl

"Just pointing out that he was excellent at his job...mostly.

I don't blame people for disliking him but at the same time I think way more of the 49ers breakdown should be put on Harbaugh, who publicly got himself purposefully fired in what was probably one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen from a head coach.

There's a reason he's out of the NFL but fans tend to side with him against Baalke despite the facts making things a lot murkier.

Overall I hope Baalke gets another chance somewhere but it won't be for a while.  I'm still annoyed at the Lattimore pick.",nfl
4 was also a good pick. Tranquil is the perfect special teams guy with the upside to take significant snaps on defense unlike Dzubnar. Overall it was a really good draft to me 5 ( Easton) is the only pick that I really didn't like and I don't even see the need for at all.,nfl

"I’m a cowboys fan but always loved watching ed reed play. One of the dallascowboy.com writers used to be a former scout for the cowboys in the late 90s early 2000s. He said Ed reed was hard to evaluate because when they looked at film, the coach would ask “where is he?” And the scout would point with a ruler/laser like two screens over on the wall and say “he’s way over here.” He was so far out of screen until the play ran and he would fly into the screen and make the play. Always thought that was funny",nfl
"NFL players all ask for their allowances from their bosses as a group. Every couple of years, the players and teams figure out how much allowance they are going to get. That group has some leaders. One of the leaders tells the players to save money in case they don't actually play football. He recommended that they save money to pay for a year or so of expenses in case they don't play games for a year due to the the players and teams not coming to an agreement. No agreement=no games=no allowance. 

That said, since NFL players are notoriously bad with money, this won't matter. The players are their own worst enemies when it comes to a lengthy contract negotiation.",nfl

"A lotta Bills fans cling to this alternate history where we draft Mahomes in that draft. I wouldn’t trust Rick Dennison and McDermott, a defensive mind HC, to develop him the way that Andy Reid did.

"Baker's dead cap to cut after one year is almost $27M. You can't just move on from that. You'd be paying more at the QB position than if you'd signed Dak. Or do you plan on just carrying 4+ QBs? You're also ignoring the part where you're missing out on other top draft talent to draft a QB every year, which hurts the team. 

It's only a better situation of he works out. 

&gt;Because some QB-hungry team ready to overpay would probably give up a top 5 pick for Dak.

Not anymore they won't. Nobody is giving up a top 5 pick for a $150M contract. 

&gt;Brady is a perfect example of what I'm saying. Look at how team-friendly

I guess more guys just need to team up with the GOAT HC and a wife worth more than they are with a job that can continue to support their lifestyle long after they retire from the NFL. Easy peasy. 

&gt;As it stands, they will have no chance once Dak starts getting paid that $30+ mil/yr.

Maybe. But then again, they can pay him $30M this year and not hurt the team vs where they were last year. They definitely have a shot this year. Also, as I've pointed out, that $30M given out this year is more realistically 25.3. Not near as bad and within your 13% threshold. But you ignore that part, because it kills your narrative.",nfl
"&gt; Freddie Kitchens ... is completely unproven

He was also the one pointing things out in coaches' meetings on Hard Knocks. You're right that he's new to the HC position, but has a good head on his shoulders.

&gt; OL lost talent, is unproven.

The only one of that starting lineup that didn't start last year was Corbett, and he was a rookie drafted for development. Robinson took over for Desmond Harrison and started the remaining nine games.

Wilks runs a 4-2-5 while Gregg runs a more traditional 4-3. Not entirely different but I'm more worried about Wilks getting stubborn and not changing his gameplan to fit the players.",nfl
"Rex Ryan was and probably is the ultimate defensive coordinator.

See I want to make him GM of a team. I want him to have to run a team with his shitbag takes. Colon Cowturd can try and deal with NFL player agents and then try drafting rookie QBs every 4-5 years. He may eventually hit on something though picking first in the draft every year for a decade.,nfl

"Go watch the film of their last 8 games again. He's incredible and absolutely proved he's that good. His blocking is elite and he's a top 15 receiving TE already.

"Manning would have been as good a QB just about anywhere. His place in the NFL QB firmament is unquestionable.

That was summer 2007, and I'd devoured the draft coverage too. I drafted Adrian Peterson (only 3 or 4 of the other players knew his potential) in a late round and smoked everyone all year.

That was also the year of Brady to Moss. That gave me a team to follow. I became a Patriots fan and never looked back.",nfl

"I think the way to think of it is this: If he doesn't play up to his contract he's essentially in the situation Flacco is, he was overpaid for a while and now is older and not highly valued.

"Kap didnt play great but that entire team was horrendous. They had an all-time terrible defense (3rd worst vs the run iirc), their top WRs were Kerley, Patton, and Streater, and Kelly always did that quicksnap shit which put our defense on the field more. Along with that, the OL was one of the worst in the league. I dont think Kap is a starter, but hes good enough to be a backup.",nfl
"If he was watching via a security feed how did he know she was passed out and not just asleep? Not defending her (because she doesn't sound like much of a choir girl herself), just pointing out that if what you said is true it's pretty irresponsible for them to report that she was passed out.",nfl
"Yes it’s grasping at straws, but also it sounds like he is just sticking his foot further into his mouth. Why not just say, “I and the Giants organization fully believe that he was in no way a reach at the 6th pick. We believe he is the Giants franchise QB of the future and we are happy to take him where we did and anyone questioning a young quarterback that hasn’t seen the field yet has no reason to believe we made anything other than the right decision.” It just sounds like more back pedaling to defend his choice which shouldn’t be necessary if they think he is actually worth the 6th pick. 

The question that I think needs to be asked more than why did he take his QB in the top 10, a totally normal thing to do, is why did he trade Snaks for a 5th rounder and then use a first rounder on an unknown rookie replacement. That’s a lack of foresight that for the life of me I can’t understand.",nfl
That's fair. OW is only being sold on the MS store for PC because they bought Obsidian and Epic isn't stupid enough to not let the owner of the IP sell it on their own platform. They did a similar deal with Ubisoft where The Division 2 was on EGS and uPlay.,nfl
"I don't see Saquon as a boom or bust RB. I see Saquon as a great RB that will be bottled up in waves because he has a dogshit Oline but if he gets a hole he is by far the most explosive RB in the league. He also is great and doing a lot with very little. 

&gt;  For example against the cowboys in week 17 he had 15 carries for 15 yards. His other two carries were big runs so his stats look more impressive than the game was. 

This scenario doesn't mean that Saquon is inconsistent and is boom or bust. This scenario tells me(after watching Saquon play a lot) that the Giants Oline sucks and if they can open any holes the dude will break it for a long one. Saquon had the most broken tackles by a massive margin this year.",nfl
"At the risk of being downvoted for being a homer, I do think there is a definitive answer

At least looking a pro football reference, The efficiency categories brees led Mahomes in are completion percentage, Int percentage, Sack percentage (though I think this is more of an OL stat) and passer rating. 

Mahomes led Brees in TD %, all YPA metrics (YPA, ANY/A etc.), QBR, DVOA and DYAR. 

Mahomes’s led in TD% over Brees is 2.1% (8.6% for Mahomes to 6.5% for Brees)

Brees’s lead in INT % is 1.1 (2.1% for Mahomes to 1.0% for Brees). 

Obviously, because a qb throws less interceptions, the gap between the percentages will be smaller than for TD% but I’d still argue Mahomes efficiency throwing TDs is pretty comparable to Brees’s efficiency avoiding picks.

Now obviously, Brees has a massive lead in Comp % which is why I think so many say Brees has Mahomes beat on efficiency but Mahomes actually has a big lead in YPA metrics.

I’m just gonna list ANY/A because it’s the most comprehensive but you can look at the others 

Patrick Mahomes had an ANY/A of 8.89. Drew Brees has an ANY/A of 8.47. That .42 difference is pretty significant for a stat like this. Now obviously, the gap isn’t as big as the completion percentage gap (74.4% for Brees to 66% for Mahomes) but I’d argue that Mahomes’s lead in DVOA (40.1 to 36.8), DYAR (2039 to 1632) plus the difference in all the yard per attempt statistics makes up for that. 

The gap between the two in passer rating and qbr is so small I’d say both are a wash 

If anything is a tough call, IMO it’s who was the more efficient qb, not the better qb last year. I’d argue that Brees and Mahomes has extremely similar efficiencies but because of the difference in volume, you can somewhat definitively say Mahomes was better last year.",nfl

Also, just thinking out loud but weren't PEDs really prevalent in the 80's and 90's when testing for them was absolutely terrible? If PEDs were the only thing making people bigger and fasrer, then you'd think they'd be bigger and faster in that era.",nfl

"First off, I just want to say great discussion and you’ve made me less negative on Norman. 

I agree that PFF grades need to be one piece of an overall number, no one stat will ever describe something voluminous, but it does help proxy instead of going through a broader statistical analysis that would be much more time intensive (though interesting). I can’t fault you for disregarding them. 

I think Norman is incredible in a zone format where he can keep his eyes on the QB. He’s very aggressive and can pick up zones fine, but needs help over the top for receiver coverage. Personally, I don’t think that merits 75mm guaranteed - but we agree there. I loved him and his quirks in Carolina because he fit our scheme really well. McD schemed the coverages around Norman. Knowing he can be very productive in the right system, ive just sat in disbelief in regards to his deployment on the WAS D (the crimsonskin tide). 

I like that perspective. It’s fair and makes sense. 

It’s just that Carolina never overpays like that.

Until we hit a sharp turn with rough rapids and friend A and B fall out of their canoe and friend C falls out trying to stop their canoe, but C washes up on shore with his kayak anyway. I stop and friend A tries to use my kayak to get theirs(it’s on the over side of the river, upside down) and mine goes down the river with no one in it. Lol. Friend D gets caught on some trees going around the turn and his canoe gets waterlogged, fortunately he makes it on shore as well. 

So, we’re down 2 kayaks and a canoe, no cell service, and no help for miles. We’re 2 hours from our stop point. The other people with us think we’re okay and that we’re coming. So friend C takes his kayak and goes to get help and hopefully cell service, and friend A really wants to start a fire. Luckily 2 fisherman help us get the canoe for friend A and B, and we get D’s water out of his. Long story short, we had to dump some gear, and I had to ride in a canoe meant for two with a lot of supplies and hopefully find my kayak down the river. Eventually we did, and we got some safe.

There's nothing intrinsically linked about those concepts, but it seems that a lot of modern games try to do both by just sort of stapling those two parts together. Fighting games are good in that they can lean heavily to the contest side instead of half-assing both.

"""I want a goddamn strong statement on marijuana.  Can I get that out of this sonofabitching, uh, domestic council? … I mean one on marijuana that just tears the ass out of them."" - Richard Nixon

""You want to know what this was really all about?  The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people.  You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did."" - John Ehrlichman (Nixon's domestic policy chief)

This is why marijuana was placed on Schedule I (with heroin) after the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 was passed, even though Nixon's own task force (known as the Shafer Commission) found marijuana to be no more harmful than alcohol, and recommended against criminalization in favor of treating as a public health issue.

"I think my point, and I feel like we disagree (which is fine) is that I'd take that shot and complete that shot 90% of the time.

That shot is worth 20 yards. If you complete that 75% of the time based on this exact situation which is realistic considering how few DBs can make that play, that's a net expected yardage gain of 15 yards (.75 * 20 yds).

Taking the check down with best case scenario is 100% completion will net you an average of 8-10 yards based on the position of the LBs. I'm okay if you say up to 12 yards too because maybe you'll get some good broken tackles.

I take the former option every time because I honestly think 75% is worst case based on the throw and how incredible I found the DB's play...

"Yeah, I should have noted in the OP that the best PPG defensive performance belongs to the 2011 Giants-- who were 25th in the regular season in ppg (I only have entire team numbers so if some of the points allowed by the team came from pick 6s or ST that may not be exact, but it was in that ballpark).

Along with the '06 Colts, the '11 Giants are a useful example of how sometimes things come together (or fall apart) on one side of the ball near the end of the year, and that season numbers aren't always an accurate reflection of the quality of a defense or offense in the playoffs.

I don't think that '11 Giants defense was just lucky. I think they were legitimately pretty damn good from what I saw of them in the playoffs (albeit not ""lower ppg than the '13 Seahawks"" good).

Hughes is on the last year of his contract and will be 31 this season, and unless Trent Murphy also has a big year he has basically no guaranteed money left after this season.

"The *team* didn’t make the playoffs. There was an OC who refused to run a balanced game plan, and did so badly he got himself fired midseason. An OL coach who *died* right at the start of training camp. One G retired, the other spent the year on IR, the C was coming off 2 surgeries in the offseason that meant he couldn’t train. The defence had a bad opening 4 games. Everson Griffen missed multiple games due to having a mental breakdown.

The Broncos had a better OL this year, and a much better running game this year. Keenum looked magnitudes worse than Kirk did this year.",nfl
"I mean what's the alternative? If this went unenforced then other players would fake a retirement, take PEDs, and then use the same excuse and cite Watson as precedent if the NFL tries to put a stop to it.

Secondly the concept of ""liability doctrine"" that an athlete is responsible for anything that goes into his body is his responsibility regardless of how unintentional the violation is a cornerstone of drug testing. Virtually every major sports governing body abides by it and the NFL is essentially forced to do the same or risk looking soft on doping.

I love Watson and will always root for him because of the touchback (and it was a touchback), but I fully support this decision by the NFL.",nfl

"If it were up to me, I want all the players to go to voluntary workouts, live together, eat sleep and breath football like they are some soulless indestructible cyborgs. 

But we don’t live in that world and the reality is there is no real incentive to go to involuntary workouts besides hanging out and getting to know new teammates + staff.

And truth be told, sure Bell could use the opportunity to be familiar with his new surroundings and Gase’ offense. But I also think there is plenty of time for that in the coming months even before TC so in the grand scheme of things, this won’t hurt him at all.

It just bothers me more than it should that people think his body is suddenly made of cotton candy and his body will fold on the first instance of contact. Dude could use *less* of that tbh. He has the frame to absorb contact. He’s trained himself to near ridiculous levels to keep in shape. He’s the best in the league at avoiding and slipping contact. He’ll be fine.",nfl

We have had a top 5 defense for years now and its all the same guys playing together. Thats not going to change.  

People always want to make an excuse for Rodgers. But what about us? What about the fact that we have had 4 different offensive coordinators in 4 years? We had to fire our OC 3/4 of the way through the season last year but nobody ever says anything about that. We had our OL coach DIE right before training camp and nobody ever says that.   

The bottom line is we have been a better team than Green Bay the last 2 seasons. And its not really up for debate. We have had to overcome just as much if not more than they have.

That level of investment is something you need to build your team around, and is a big reason why when he leaves the defenses regress consistently.  Fangio is a part of the formula for his defense to work.

I hope he does well as a HC since he's waited for a long time to get it, but I'm skeptical of whether Elway will allow him to get the players he needs.  CHJ's contract issues may be a bad sign for things to come if they are trying to cheap out on the D.",nfl

Tom Brady and the Patriots have a covert operation through TB12 where they are funneling hundred of millions of dollars into Tom's bank account through physical therapy and dealing heroin out of the TB12 Center in Foxboro.

As good as Monk was -  there's a really good argument for Manley over him due to positional value, especially at his 18.5 sack peak, Manley had one of the greatest peaks for an EDGE ever)

Basically if this is applied to the entire NFL, you're now in a league where Joe Montana, Roger Staubach, Fran Tarkenton, Ken Anderson, Jim Kelly, John Elway, Dan Marino, Peyton Manning and a host of others has been added to a league that already has Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Matt Ryan (or you can cheat and have the Falcons have Brett Favre), Russell Wilson, Pat Mahomes (Chiefs have had good QBs but most Chiefs fans would pick Mahomes), etc.

You can also cheat and add Steve Young to Tampa Bay as well.

And while Theismann was really good at his peak, and would thrive in a modern passing era, Dan Marino playing 2019 football would not be a pretty sight for his opponents. Same with Elway. So we're going hard into EDGE and CB and DL to deal with this. Lucky for the Skins, they have an alive Sean Taylor to go along with a top 5 GOAT CB and Josh Norman who is still well above average, if overpaid, and this goes along with a strong (Kerrigan is a HOFer, Manley had borderline HOF numbers and a ridiculous peak but the drugs fucked him over).

I’m actually more concerned about Blair. He just seems super undisciplined, and while that may net a couple of good plays and fun hits, it’s also going to be a lot of penalties and bad plays (coverage mishaps most likely). See: Germaine Ifedi for super undisciplined reference point. Like you said, we’re in pretty good shape at safety so maybe it could pay off in a Kam kinda way (learn to tackle and hit properly for a year before playing extensively). I just see him as much more  likely to be the next Delano Hill than the next Kam, or even next Mcdougald (Kam is an unfair bar to set), which would be a tough pill for a top-50 pick. 

Hope I am wrong though and we do in fact have a new enforcer. I will gladly buy his jersey if I am wrong. 

Also, I think even with all the DK hype I think we all know he could be a total bust. Worth the risk for his ceiling at #64 overall though. I just hope people recognize that when complaining about John’s drafting in 2022.",nfl

"This is post probably will get removed, but fuck it.  You put in effort, so I'll reply.  First off, if you think Rodgers is better, good on you.  There are legitimate arguments to be made.  Personaly, I disagree, but whatever.  Cases can be made for any number of QBs as the greatest and if Wayne fucking Gretzky isn't even the consensus greatest Hockey player of all time with his numerous untouchable records, than it's pretty arrogant to dismiss arguments favoring any number of QBs over Brady.  That being said, I do have a few responses and issues with some of our arguments:
  
  Your biggest issue is comparing 2 different periods of football.  Rodgers entered the league as it was shifting dramatically toward being a passer league.  Brady began when it was much more balanced/rush friendly.  
  
During Brady's first 3 Super Bowls (2001-2004) the following was true:
  
  - There were only 13 4k passing yard seasons, accomplished by 9 QBs.  Nobody hit 5000.
  
  - There were only 8 seasons of 30 passing TDs accomplished by 6 QBs.  Only Manning surpassed 40.  
  
  - There were only 4 seasons in which a QB had 4k yards and 30 TDs.  
  
  - There were only 2 seasons where a full-season starter threw fewer than 10 interceptions
  
Rodgers took over in 2008.  In his first 4 years - during which Brady was already 32-36, the following stats are true.  
  
  - There were only 31 4k passing yard seasons, accomplished by 15 different QBs.  There were 4 seasons fo 5k yards, accomplished by 3 QBs. 
  
  - There were 17 seasons of 30 passing TDs.  3 times a QB surpassed 40.  
  
  - There were 12 seasons in which a QB had 4k yards and 30 TDs.  
  
  - There were 10 seasons where a full-season starter threw fewer than 10 interceptions
  
  &gt; Brady has to do less to win.
  
  I mean, that’s the style of play they’ve always had.  Some will knock him for making shorter and easier throws and letting the receiver get the bulk of the yards.  Some will praise him for hitting tight window timing routes, playing at a rapid pace, controlling the clock, and reading the defense to give the receiver the best opportunity to turn and run with it.  There is some truth to both arguments.  Ultimately, any kind of YPA is a flawed argument unless you can argue that YPA is directly correlated with winning.  Lots of high YPA guys suck.  Fitz led the league last year, Mullins was 5th, Winston was 10th.  Rodgers?  17th. Brady was 13th.   YPA needs context to matter.  
  
  &gt; Brady’s defense keeps him in the game despite underperforming just for him to eek out some final points to win the game and the defense to close out any comeback. Brady was credited for a game winning drive in SBLIII for doing just this.
  
  First off, I think game winning drive stats are kinda bullshit because it’s all about opportunity, but the bullshit knife cuts both ways.  Brady has game winning stats because he’s had the opportunity.  But you also can’t take away from his late game heroics just because he had the opportunity.  In those final drives, Brady has shown a tremendous knack for putting whatever performance he had to point behind him to drive the ball downfield and get exactly what is needed in high-pressure moments against the clock.  It’s notable, it’s impressive, but it’s not really quantifiable.  You can say, ""I believe Rodgers could have made similar comebacks"" but you can't really detract from Brady's.  
  
  &gt; Okay, and let’s talk about last playoffs. 77% of Brady's completions in the playoffs didn't even go 10 yards in the air. You’re telling me that Rodgers couldn’t do that if he were on the Pats instead?
  
  Well, a few things.  First, Brady was 41 to Rodgers 35.  If we were arguing who is the better QB today, it’s probably Rodgers.  But you are arguing history, so that doesn’t fly.  Also, that's kind of situational.  First, the best receivers on that team were RBs, TEs and slot guys (so all short route types) and we had very little dependable receivers for intermediate to deep routes.  It was gameplan as much as Brady.  Second, SD and LA had 2 of the best pass rushes in the league, so considering Brady isn't much of a scrambler, quick throws was the smart strategy and those tend to be short.  Lastly, especially against SD, short thows were used to eat at the clock in a game we controlled from the get-go.    
  
  &gt; Let’s shift back to the regular season. Surely the BEST QB of all time would produce more than Aaron Rodgers, right?
  
  This is the ""different eras"" argument I started with.  When they started overlapping in '09, the shift toward pass-happy league was well underway.  At that time, Brady was 32 and coming off an ACL tear while Rodgers was 25.  
  
  &gt; Pats fans love to point out that the team went 16-0 the year prior without Brady, don’t mention that they also went the year after with Brady. Huh, funny how that works.
  
  Well, that's simplifying it.  First, that argument is only usually made when people try and dismiss Brady because the Pats went 11-5 without him.  The shift from '07 to '08 is a complex discussion in and of itself.  Second, Cassell was decent.  He made a Pro Bowl 2 years later. He's infinitely better than the slugs Indy fielded when Manning went down and better than Hundley, Flynn, Tolzien, and whoever else replaced Rodgers when GB lost him. Third, that 2008 team had the 4th easiest schedule in the leaague as they went 11-5.  In 2009, the Pats had the 6th hardest schedule - including 4 games against teams that made the Conference Championship.  Lasly, it also was a significantly worse team than the '08 squad.  The defense lost 5 key starters and offensively, they lost their '08 WR3 Gaffney to FA, his replacement (Brandon Tate) to multiple knee injuries, and later, Welker to a torn ACL.  We handed 11 WR starts went to Sam Aiken, Isaiah Stanback and the corpse of Joey Gallaway.  We ultimately ended up turning to a rookie Julien Edelman, who had literally never played WR before.  2009 really wasn't that good a team and was playing a really tough schedule.  
  
  There are plenty of factors as to why the '09 was worse than the '08 team.   It's pretty reductionist to assume the QB situation had much if any impact.  
  
  &gt;""3 of Brady’s Super Bowl winning seasons were in different eras.""  Dan Marino played in an even older era. No excuses.
  
  Yup, and Dan Marino is wildly underrated.  You could probably craft a solid argument for why he's the greatest QB of all time too.  But just like the era argument is valid there, it's also valid with Rodgers.",nfl
"If you are going to go as so far as to use indoor vs outdoor then you may as well use strength of schedule as well. How about the fact that brady has had the best coach ever, and the best GM ever.

"A 7 win team, that added marquee players at positions of need on both sides of the ball. Denver added... Joe Flacco (who as I mentioned, managed 6 points against an average at best Browns defense last year). They also brought in Kareem Jackson to replace Bradley Roby.

Moral of the story, Browns were a better team last year, and appear to have improved significantly more than Denver improved. You'd be hard pressed to find a sports book that considers the Broncos a favorite in that game.

"Easily Vick. I think his biggest issue was simply work ethic related. If he had work hard on learning the playbook and worked with a passing coach early on, he would of been a consistent Top 10 QB.

RG3 had a couple of huge issues. First, he couldn’t keep his body out of harms way. He was athletically gifted but was not a natural runner in that he seemed to always get hurt on the move.  Vick was a great runner and injuries were never an issue. Secondly, there were questions how well he adjusted from an air raid offense to a pro-style offense. His lack of understanding of pro concepts early on forced the Skins to implement a read option offense as a bridge. I’m not sure he’s ever proven to run a pro offense.",nfl
"Arguably the Rams.

"Last season the Pats rushed for about 2000 yards and that was #5 in the NFL. The Seahawks ran for 2500 for #1, but that was helped a lot by the QB. Same for Ravens (LJ) and Panthers (Cam). Only the Rams (#3) rushed for more than the Pats without the help of a big-time rushing QB. (note 1)

For the last 25-30 years the Top Rushing Team has totaled around 2500 yards. You can go way back to the Golden Age of RBs in the 70-80s and get some 2700+ yard totals. 

In 1978 the Patriots set the NFL record with 3165.

I think the 2019 Patriots could break that record and get 3200 yards rushing. 

But I think they will opt to just control the clock most of the time and rush for about 2600. The image of Rex Burkhead breaking into the open...and running at about half speed with both arms around the ball so he doesn't fumble is burned in my mind.


Note 1: Seahawks, Ravens, and Panthers all had Top 4 Rushing Attacks and Running QBs. None had a playoff win. Running QBs are great. I don't think they tend to be QBs who can win playoff games with regularity. RWilson is the rare exception.",nfl

"chemistry with the QB? so what you're saying is adjusting for his drop back speed? I don't see how that's gonna take more than a single day.

building chemistry with the offensive line? that's not gonna happen in OTA's. you need full contact to do that. and you don't really know how the offensive line is gonna hold up against certain matchups till you're actually in that game and they're facing those guys. so the chemistry thing is something you have to build up each game. it's why you can just insert RBs behind good lines and have success, it's not really dependent on the RB, their job is to just run where the holes are after the holes have been created.

I mean if I remember correctly Garropolo unfortunately tore his ACL pretty early last year, right? On 90 mil guaranteed over 3 years, that's 30 mil a year and he missed most of the season which is easily 20 million by itself, just for the 9ers.

As for ""afford"", this may surprise you, but companies don't go into business to offer charity. They can afford to make you a free game, but they aren't going to.

Our teams have had direct involvement this offseason going back to the rookie of the year voting to the OBJ trade. It's created some bad blood with Browns fans undermining what Saquon did, some even saying Chubb was better, and Giants fans undermining what Mayfield did. That's where the bad blood started.

You don’t see dumb players spot those small holes in the defense to slip a pass into.

"I care less about the Watt arguement. But did you say Mack isnt even on the same tier as Donald? As I stated before, Donald is the best in the league, but Mack is a close second. Coming from a packers fan, you should know better as Mack had one of the best 1st half for a defensive player which took place week one in 2018(ESPN and NFL network have both called it that.) Went four straight weeks with strip sack. If you look at the film, the man has blown threw more double and triple teams than I've ever seen. Look at the lions game , the Vikings game and the giants game where hes putting tackles flat on their ass. The only player to have his kind of speed to power conversion was Lawerence Taylor(Belichick wont admit it lol). I watched a good number of rams games this year, and Donald is amazing to watch. It's hard to argue anyone better than him. Clearly I have a biased for mack. But I've seen Donald get bear on more one on one's than Mack. Mack had more fumbles, and I also feel we play a tougher division. Shoot when we played each other, Donald didnt have a single hit, mack in double team got another strip sack.
You ask anyone with a football IQ, they will mostly agree Donald is the top dog and mack is either 2nd or 3rd. Dont believe, watch the highlight of Mack sacking Rodgers with his back lol",nfl

If some arbitrary determination of how relevant a player was on culture is how we're allowing Moon in but keeping Rivers out, then I don't even know where to start with that.",nfl

"Yeah, I’m still holding onto hope that Colbert can recapture some of his rookie year swag, because imo we’ll be fine if he plays like he did in 2017. I think him and Spoon regressed in part because they were basically handed the starting jobs before OTAs. With some real competition, hopefully they can get some shit going.

"If you get downvoted each time you say that, it's probably because it's easy to say ""he was bad"". You can do some analysis to back it up, or don't complain if people downvote you. PFF had him as the top QB in the last quarter of the season. He had great games against Denver, Buffalo, Colts, Packers, Detroit, and Houston despite really not having much to work with and an offensive line that was falling apart every play, if they could snap the ball to him accurately.

"Thats basically restating what I said. You think Rivers getting in opens the doors to guys like Testaverde, as if being a good QB for a long time is the same thing as being a bad QB for a long time. 

Difference between Rivers and Romo is smaller and I think Romo would have a hope of getting in if he played longer but as it stands Rivers will likely play twice as long, already has twice as many pro-bowls, has more than twice as many playoff wins, led the league in more categories and more time. I really don't get the argument that if you put Rivers in then Romo should get in too.",nfl
It's different for smaller markets. There are dozens of Buffalo size or bigger markets without teams that would consider outbidding Buffalo to snatch the Bills.

"If we are talking talent, which is subjective, you can't say definitely. If you are talking athleticism, which is less subjective then 100% Rodgers is more athletic than Brady. Talent at QB to me also includes making the best choices at the most pressing times and to me Brady is leagues above Rodgers in that. I also would argue he isn't the most athletic ever. You are well within your rights to do so but I would disagree with Favre as one of many examples imo. As this is veering into something off-topic I'll drop it here. I'll just say I still think it is utterly ridiculous to consider Rodgers a better QB than Brady, which is my opinion, and that you are entitled to disagree.",nfl
"Which is hilarious because Marshawn and him have the exact same decline. Both signed big contracts as older backs and then immediately got hurt and declined. Yet, Shaun is constantly shit on and Marshawn is beloved. Marshawn even skipped a playoff game and his reputation didn’t take a hit.

It’s hard for me to think Baker is close to Ben or Phillip. Juju and Keenan have been pretty productive WRs. We do have to wait and see if Juju can be a #1 on his own though. But no way do I think Baker is close to Big Ben or Rivers.. yet. After this season, that’ll probably change. Maybe by mid-season it will.",nfl
"I'm not wrong. It's a subjective opinion. I find that Baker responding to idiots like Cowherd and getting into pity fights with them is immature and stupid for a starting QB in the league. Sure, Cowherd riles him up, but Baker plays into it. I feel like other QBs in the league wouldnt do it. And because Baker does shit like this, everytime he slips up, it'll get magnified.

And hell, I dont mean to come off as a hater either because I think Mayfield is a great QB who has potential to be elite. But the stupid pettiness, need for talking too much and partaking in distractions is going to hurt him. 

My opinion on the Browns this year was they're a super talented team but they have a first time HC with 3 gigantic personalities in Baker, OBJ and Landry. I think the first time they encounter adversity, the locker room might blow up. Baker getting involved in his RBs contract drama, fighting with Cowherd, getting ""talked to"" by the team vets *in June* doesnt bode well. I dont think that's a super hateresque view to have.",nfl
"That magical season came from the defense, which consistently gave Cam great field position.  We've got a completely re-tooled front 7, and three good pieces in our secondary.  If our FS works out and the front 7 meshes and plays at a high level, we could very well be looking at a repeat.

Weapons aren't even close, Dak has never had the weapons Wentz had in 2017 and 2018. 

Playcalling also not close at all, Pederson is head and shoulders over Linehan. Linehan is absolute trash.",nfl

I don't want to give Chris Simms and whoever he works for a click. Can anyone tell me if his list was supposed to be all time or just for next season. If he is talking career/all-time then yeah that is idiotic. If he only means going into next season then Brady is fine but Brees is asinine. Brady last season didn't have the best stats and the offense struggled in some games including the SB. I'm a Pats fan and 99% of Pats fans will disagree but I feel like he didn't have a great season despite playing great some games and winning the SB. But Drew Brees could legitimately have been the MVP last season. Otherwise I think Warner is overreacting and Simms is an arrogant a-hole. Shouldn't give trolls attention that is what they want. Not a big fan of Warner as a football analyst but still expected more of him.,nfl

"Maybe start with the things I just mentioned?  
  
Targeting RBs [is shit for QB efficiency,](https://media.profootballfocus.com/2018/03/EPA-Skill-positions2-768x432.jpg) but our most reliable and available target was an RB and on top of White's 22% target share Michel and Develin had another 28 targets between the two. 26.5% of throws at RBs. That wasn't by choice.  
  
Hogan, Dorsett and Patterson were three of the least effective WRs in the NFL last season, but they were Brady's top 3 options for 25% of the season. They combined for another 22% target share.  
  
I love Edelman to death but he's a limited downfield receiver who excels in the area within 15 yards of the LoS and he doesn't present any kind breakaway threat. Gronk only ran 350 routes last season and anybody with eyes could see he wasn't near the same player he was even a year ago. There's a reason he retired, missed a handful of games midseason and was almost exclusively asked to block in a few others.  
  
Gordon was the most useful tool we had to support QB passing efficiency both in terms of his skill set and the fact that he could provide a credible downfield threat to open up defenses and stop them from sitting on everything short. He played in 11 games, but didn't even top 20 snaps in 2 of those games. Over the 9 games where Gordon played over 18 snaps, Brady completed threw for 64.4%, 2441, 11 and 2 with an ANY/a of 8.01. Over the first 5 games before Gordon was traded for or got up to speed well enough to contribute significantly , he completed 67.6% for 1253, 12 and 6 with an ANY/a of 6.41. Isn't it a little bit telling that he was completing a full 3% more of his passes for over 2 full yards less in raw Y/A?
  
Three recorded ints were 100% not his fault, [1](https://youtu.be/rAbYY3iguis?t=371), [2](https://youtu.be/rAbYY3iguis?t=432), [3](https://youtu.be/mSA_H7EFMgQ?t=248), and [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16IpyBfVl6Q&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=628) wasn't a perfect throw but if we're playing the ""what probably should have happened"" game it probably should have been caught or incomplete, not coughed up to a different defender entirely.   
  
How many of these things you may have considered along the way should probably tell you how informed your own ranking was. When I wrote [my original piece about Brady](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/bmkv9c/2019_rnfl_top_100_players_of_the_2018_season/emxtnht/?context=3) I acknowledged that he could still reasonably be left off the top 100, but with Rodgers making it and Luck 50 spots and counting above him, that concession has grown less and less valid by the week.

Oh you mean the guy that threw 7 TDs in 3 quarters is also a system QB? The eagles got extremely lucky they had Nick Foles as a backup. He's really talented. It's not like they were trotting out Colt McCoy in the playoffs that year. System QB comment is a bit unfair. I'd even go as far as to say Nick Foles is just as talented as Goff. It just took a bit to hit his stride.,nfl

Five years after getting fired from the Panthers, he got rehired on an interim basis and did a good enough job to get hired for good.

"My non-homer, NFC focused perspective agrees here. They could also easily be fairly mediocre. They're returning to the team identity of strong front-7 as far as I can tell, and they have a good RB, but as always it seems to rest on whether Cam is ""on"" or just present. When it works, it *really* works, but if things are a bit off they're not a great team. 
 
My totally homer NFCS opinion is that they may be past the point where they can ask Cam to go out and play QB like a brickhouse linebacker and are asking him to be something he's never been in the passing game which could be a recipe for a disappointing year. Lingering shoulder injury last year, new offense, new throwing motion (apparently?), that's a lot of variables to me for a guy who is the cornerstone to the team and has never operated as a true passing QB.",nfl
Most likely he'd go to a veteran team that is a QB away(or feels like they're a QB away anyway). Who that team would be in 2021(when Cousins is a FA again)is up in the air. Maybe the Bucs build up a juggernaut but Winston can't progress under Arians and he'll want a veteran.,nfl

Different terms for different systems I guess.  These guys made the distinction, sounds like KC doesn't anymore

&gt;Mike Kuchar, the senior ­research manager at ­XandOLabs.com, traces the RPO concept, in modern college football, to Coach Joe Tiller’s pyrotechnic teams at Purdue. Tiller ran packaged plays that allowed the quarterback — starting with Drew Brees in the late 1990s — to make a pre-snap decision based on where an outside linebacker lined up. If he started inside a slot receiver, Brees would run a bubble screen, trapping the linebacker inside. If the linebacker lined up outside the slot, Brees would run a draw play, handing off to a running back and making it easy to block the linebacker.

&gt;The concept would not be considered an RPO, because the quarterback’s decision happened before the snap. It is more of a proto-RPO, outlining the concepts coaches would use to create an even more sinister predicament for defenders.

Oh and WaPo and their paywall blow but if you do some fuckery with incognito mode + searching the title it seems to work.  Enjoyable read",nfl
There's zero chance he doesn't make the roster and I don't know why Steelers fans keep saying this. Ben loves him and Ben runs the team.

"Probably an unpopular opinion, but if you're taking pure physical ability I'd say Michael Vick.  He could run better than a lot of starting RBs, he had a cannon for an arm, and pinpoint accuracy.  He had a bit of trouble reading defenses (especially before prison) but that doesn't factors into physical ability. Only knock on him physically is that his height (six foot) is a little short for a QB.

Edit. 

Found the play I mentioned. With out this play, which was done as a desperate coaching decision, he would have bested Joe Thomas’s consecutive snap record by about 400.

"Just no. As an international fan, the NFL is so good because they don't play too many games. I can watch almost every single game of the season apart from a couple of low-ranked teams in the last few rounds, and know that they actually matter.

It is so hard for me in Australia to catch a single game during the season because every game is at 7am on a Monday morning, but every time I do, it is freaking AMAZING because the game actually matters.

They don't have a good back up to replace him, win for Dak. The market says the tag for a QB is over 28m/y (close to 30), win for Dak. 4th rounder so a 5th year extension is out of the question, win for Dak. Dak has all of the leverage here, now obviously you can't pay the dude 6000000000000000000000000000 dollars. But my entire point is he'll get AT LEAST 32m, which is what he deserves.

"That the Lions have sucked is not relevant to the conversation. They are trying to get better. Paying out extra cap space isn't going to help with that. Also, during Calvin's tenure on the team, the Lions were fucked harder by the rookie contracts of Calvin, Suh, and Stafford(all pre CBA and massive rookie deals) then any other team. The Rams are the only remotely comparable team, and they don't even sniff what the Lions had to deal with. And yet, they still managed to improve the team significantly over his time in Detroit. 

If they hadn't had to deal with those crippling contracts, who knows what they could have done with that roster. There could easily have been a couple more really big names in Detroit in the early 2010s. 

I'm not saying its Calvin's fault, getting drafted when he did, but I am definitely saying the circumstances led to a massive hurdle no other team had to face. 

Personally, I think the biggest failing of the Mayhew era was extending Suh and Calvin, along with their restructers. Literally no WR is worth what we were paying Calvin. Not a single one. But they paid him out of some sense of loyalty, or something, I'm not sure. Regardless, they paid him an absolutely absurd amount of money. Truly absurd. And he doesn't seem to recognize that. 

People like to say things like, he gave his everything to the team, they should be more grateful. But so does most of the roster on most teams. Calvin was a special talent, but the current FO doesn't owe him anything compared to what they owe to the fans and, frankly, the other players on the team. It's their job to make the best team they possibly can. I'm not suggesting they are unimpeachable in regards to their efforts or anything. But Calvin isn't a part of the team any more. It's their job to worry about the here and now, not history. And if history and the here and now can coexist? Great. If they can't, then the now gets the priority.

And yeah, oh woe is me about a dude who made a killing at the expense of the team being better overall isn't the same thing at all as screwing over a normal employee. He's made it clear that he both didn't understand his contract and that he thinks he's owed something for product not delivered. It's not even remotely in the same ballpark as you or me. 

The fact that they aren't a good team(although here's where I again point out that they are almost league average over the last decade, not the bottom feeders they once were) isn't relevant to the conversation. Making sure a player had good feels doesn't matter when you are trying, emphasis on trying, to be a good team would be negligent, frankly. And it's not as if the team hasn't tried to make things right. They have. He's hung up on a relatively miniscule amount of money. If that money was in some way life changing for him, that's one thing. It's not. No one in the organization has ever said anything negative about him. They'd welcome him on with open arms. He got upset because money was more important to him than the team finding success. That's his right. But it doesn't mean i, as a fan, should take his side. 

I want my team to do whatever they can to get an edge. No matter how small. The only thing they owe me, as a fan, is an attempt to be as good as they can be. And while they haven't been successful yet, I appreciate that they are TRYING. There's no apathy happening.",nfl

As a Chiefs fan, I'll back up this opinion. People can rightfully point to rings or playoff success but he's one of the best quarterbacks I've seen in my lifetime. Fuck the haters. Respect to him.

Eli being mentioned as a Hall of Famer while being carried by a great defense is one of the biggest jokes of my lifetime. One of the most overrated quarterbacks I've ever seen and simply gets the east coast/New York bump of hype. 

Put Rivers on any of those teams and he also wins a ring. It's a team sport but objectively looking at overall ability it's not even close with Rivers and Eli. Rivers every day of the week and twice on Sunday.",nfl
"Its not about how many comebacks you have, its about who and when you do it. Brady comes back in the playoffs, Stafford comes back in a regular season against a 4-12 team.

"&gt;The rest of the AFC North is down

Appearantly the outside looking in has a much different point of view

As far as I can tell from my viewpoint of inside the division its anybody's to win. It's always a bad idea to bet against the Steelers, the Bengals are perennially underrated and then killed by injuries (it just takes one year without injuries to change that), and even if you don't belive in Jackson our secondary is monstrous and our run game is still fueled by one of the best guards in the league.

It's anybody's division, imo. (Although Jonah already being injured is a terrible sign for the Bengals)",nfl
"Desean Jackson was the big character in Philly that seemed to never reign in his antics. Reid was often seen as taking Jackson under his wing. He also lost the locker room at the end in Philly. Both of these have been discussed before, and might be considered fair criticism with respect to Reid failing with discipline.

New england is the gold standard in this regard, and I can't imagine either situation happening there.",nfl
"I think Holmes could be top 3 for a three year stretch out of the people on the list. He was 2nd in both (YFS) and (total TDs). I guess it’s what you value more at that point. The top three in my eyes would be (in no particular order) Holmes, LT, Faulk just based on pure numbers. 

Holmes not only scored a lot, he also put the team in scoring position with all those yards. 

LT scores A LOT. However, he was 4th in (YFS). 

Faulk could MOVE that ball downfield to put the team in scoring position. He could also score being top 3, according to the stats you provided (thank you for that sir). 

If I had to make a split second decision based on what I just wrote I would go:

1. Faulk
2. Holmes
3.  LT

For this three year stretch at least.  Mostly because of Faulks ability to score and move the ball well. I really appreciate someone who can churn out yards.",nfl
"&gt;But again Bears rookie wideout Tavon Austin found himself targeted on fourth down by running back Chris Long.

"Wait, did a Redskins fan comment on OUR QB's durability??  You guys went thru what, 4 QBs before landing a guy that learned the offense &amp; his new teammates from playing Madden?  lol

"#23. Washington Redskins

Biggest strength: The Redskins lack depth and star power across the board, but their pass rush should be just as strong as ever. Ryan Kerrigan is perhaps the league's most underrated edge defender, as he recorded 61 total pressures a season ago, including 20 combined sacks and QB hits. Kerrigan missed just one tackle attempt all season long.

Biggest weakness: Projecting the Redskins' weaknesses starts on offense, where they were decimated by injuries in 2018. Depth was clearly an issue along the offensive line, and that unit will be without swing tackle Ty Nsekhe in 2019 -- and could also be without All-Pro Trent Williams. With so few quality offensive tackles in the league, Washington's issues at the position are far from being solved.

X factor for 2019: Derrius Guice. The former second-round pick was sidelined last season after being injured in the preseason but should return to full form in 2019 as a versatile, talented back. He forced at least 44 missed tackles and gained at least 750 yards after contact in his last two seasons at LSU. He is a load to bring down.",nfl
"Brady’s throwing motion, footwork, PA movement sure had changed over the last 15 years.

"I don't think they win anything with Bledsoe. He kind of did okay for a while afterwards but his situation with the Pats was about as stale as it gets. Putting games in Bledsoe's hands wasn't a style of play that complemented the rest of the team at all.

"Yeah it was looked into by the NFL and deemed ok. I remember reading about it a bit but overall its not really interesting enough to really give a shit (as in, I could not care less about any NFL players personnel life and find the topic boring)

To list a few reasons why, I can probably surmise that one reason is that Patriots players are not required to use TB12 therapy. They can choose to and maybe their ""Pats health insurance"" covers it, but its not really some team to player funnel. I would also imagine that TB12  therapy still pays rent, even if its probably discounted. Also, I would imagine that unless it was strictly forbidden, Kraft and Brady are so close that unless they were to receive some ridiculous fine they would do it anyway, as Brady is almost guaranteed to retire a Pat. 

At the end of the day, were the Krafts funneling millions of dollars secretly into Bradys pockets through his diet/massage/lifestyle center in Foxboro, the NFL would probably have uncovered it.

Side note, but actually TB12 Methods message and central tenants are pretty good. I read some of the recipes in his cookbook online, and yeah, if you eat lean cuts of duck and tuna, and don't eat sugars, even if they are from fruit (unless they are dried fruit rollup things LMAO) and work out with resistance bands to avoid muscle tears and over excursion, and can afford to buy electrolyte drops, yada yada, then you are gonna be healthy. The issue is that following any exercise and diet regimen that closely requires such a level of dedication. that you are probably a healthy person that you would do that in the first place).",nfl
"Honestly, I think the sucking thing is kinda due to the competition in the NFC North. I think they're in an okay spot, its just that the teams in their division have been a notch or two ahead of them for decades in some fashion. 

I mean, since the 1990s, the Lions have had to deal with 3 Super Bowl appearances from the Packers, several strong seasons from the Vikings, and the Bears popping out every other 8 years or so. Even having to deal with the likes of Cunningham, Farve, Rodgers, Urlacher over the decades for so long (Just a couple of the many examples of HoF talent constantly in the NFC North).

The Lions aren't a great team, but by no means have been a terrible team. I would happily take the Lions over Dolphins, Cardinals, Buccaneers, Bengals, Giants, Redskins definitely and would have to make arguments over the Jets, Raiders, Bills, Denver, and Carolina.

They aren't great, but they aren't bad by any means. They're solid, but just in a tough division. I can respect them.",nfl
"They had two generational talents at their positions and with CJ, they had a quality QB too.


But that wasn’t enough. They were unlucky, sure, but they also couldn’t turn the corner because they couldn’t attract enough supporting players.

I read an article a few months back where they had a formulate rating quarterbacks based on statistics and wins. They then charted every quarterback to start in the last 25 years.

"**Raiders (6-10):** I believe Jon Gruden and Mike Mayock are planning for a multi-year rebuild and 2019 isn't going to be the year they push for a deep playoff run. They have added a lot of talent to their team, including WR Antonio Brown, RB Josh Jacobs, DE Clelin Ferrell, and other additions. I believe they will improve on their 4-12 record however they won't be overly successful.

In 2020, the Raiders are on track to have over $40M in cap space and two first-round picks which may give them leverage for a shot at a deep playoff run next year.

**Lions (7-9):** Statistically, the Lions had a top-15 defense and in some categories a top-10 defense in 2018. With new additions such as DE Trey Flowers, CB Justin Coleman, LB Jahlani Tavai and having a defensive-minded HC with Matt Patricia, the Lions are certainly in position to improve on their above average defense, even with the loss of Ziggy Ansah. The addition of TE TJ Hockenson is an interesting one. Hockenson has been given the hype that he was one of the best overall players in the 2019 draft, and he may prove to be a key addition to the Lions' offensive this upcoming year.  

I believe the Lions will improve on their 6-10 record in 2018, but not by a significant amount. They are still under-going a rebuild under new HC Matt Patricia, who has imposed a demanding player culture and may take time to find success.

**Buccaneers (5-11):** The Buccaneers had one of the worst defenses in the NFL last year, giving up 2nd-league worst 29 points per game. They seem to have addressed their defensive woes by hiring new DC Todd Bowles and drafting defensive players with their first five picks in the draft. Hopefully these new changes will help the Bucs have at least a top-20 defense in the upcoming year.

New HC Bruce Arians has a strong rapport with QB Jameis Winston and their relationship may prove vital to the Buccaneers' success in 2019. Even with their 5-11 record, the 2018 Buccaneers had one of the most productive offenses in the league, leading the league in passing yards per game but also having a lot of interceptions. Hopefully Arians can continue his offensive success he enjoyed throughout his coaching career and keep the Buccaneers' offensive as productive but with less turnovers and a higher scoring efficiency. 

The Buccaneers play in a historically tough division and they face 
a tough schedule in 2019. I believe they will remain at 5-11 such as last year. With a new coaching staff, new defensive talent, and having on track over $61 million in cap space in 2020, the Buccaneers are certainly in position to have success beyond the 2019 season.",nfl

"From 2002-2009, Josh McCown earned more than $15 million playing in the NFL. So he already had financial security when making his decision to be a good example for his kids.

Further,[ according to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Football_League_\(2009%E2%80%932012\)#The_2009_soft_launch_and_the_league's_financial_structure), in 2010, starting QBs in the UFL earned a salary of $200,000. Let's assume that's what he made.

We don't have to assume his next NFL contract: in 2011, McCown earned $810,000 with the 49ers. The following season, in 2012, he was paid $875,000 by the Bears.

He wasn't leaving millions on the table. He was leaving $600,000-$675,000 on the table with probably millions in the bank. Moreover, he knew that if an NFL team was knocking on his door that August, he would probably have more opportunities to play in the NFL going forward, after he'd honored his UFL contract.

Everyone though RG3 and Kaep were gonna revolutionize the NFL after their rookie seasons only to be completely and utterly exposed for the entire careers after that. I’m not the dude isn’t talented, clearly he is. I’m just saying when you have a freak talent like him, also surrounded by some of the best talent in the league (one of the fastest humans on the planet as a wide receiver) it’s much easier and takes defensive coordinators off guard. They have an entire off season to prepare for people like him, just like they did with RG3 and Kaep. You hardly EVER heard DE’s watching for RPO before they entered the league. Next year, every DE was trained it and those two be irrelevant. Mahomes is obviously better than those two, but the logic remains the same. 

You know how fucking easy it is to stand in a pocket when you are constantly scared as a defense everywhere? Top 3 TE running a seam, fastest person in the nfl running around crazy in the secondary, top 5 RB running around crazy and then Mahomes. Lol. Makes it PRETTY easy when you’re talented. 

We’ll see after this year. He has another stellar year and I’m on the hype train. 

I just don’t get overly excited too soon. I was shaking my fucking head for days after Kaep’s first official start when he beat Green Bay game 1 of the season. I was watching SportsCenter and they had ENTIRE SEGMENTS talking about this dude going down as one of the greats and guessing when he would be inducted to the hall of fame. Fucking ridiculous. 

My can’t do dick line in the pocket is in reference to how I feel he will do next year without all his weapons and defensive coordinators stare at his footage for an entire off season. I don’t know shit about football tho. Fuck out of here.",nfl

"&gt; That Amari take is really deceitful. He blew up in 2 games.

Stats aren't really deceitful. What's deceitful is having a take (ex. Amari was inconsistent.) without comparing it against other players.

You can call Amari inconsistent, but to say his play wasn't in the top 20 of all WR, even after having two bye weeks and changing offenses, is not honest, because the stats say otherwise.

Yes, and we would keep this under any alternative plan. If anything, it should be stiffened.

&gt;partially because rules like the franchise and transition tag as well as RFA rules give the advantage to the incumbent team,

This isn't free agency, these are rules which prevent a player from reaching free agency. If a player wants out, all this does is delay them and sour the relationship. 

&gt;and partially because the draft forces them to spend 4 years with an organization, creating relationships with that organization and its fans and making them want to stay

I find it hard to believe they wouldn't let a player play just in case something were to happen. Plus the story of him coming back would be fucking huge. far outweighs the potential backlash just in case something happened.

This is not the same and there’s a very good reason that it’s a lot less risky to keep drafting a QB instead overpaying an average one. There’s a rookie wage scale. If you want to pay your stud QB they have to be like Wilson Mahomes Wentz Watson who can consistently perform at a high level. Dak is Alex Smith. Would you rather pay Alex Smith at 26 30 mill a year or draft a rookie making 10 mill a year in the first round and be able to stack your team around him. To me having an average QB caps your teams ceiling and it becomes purgatory. Dak is like the DeMar Derozen of the NFL.,nfl

"I can understand the concern with the guaranteed money, but I also think that offering him that much guaranteed was the only way to get him to really sign the deal now as opposed to next year when the APY for QBs is even higher. I think it comes down to a question of ""do you think that Wentz is the QB of the future for the Eagles?"" Even with the injuries, we've seen his ceiling. It's MVP level sort of play when he's healthy. He was hampered by knee and back issues last season and (I would say) was still at least an upper half QB, perhaps even top 10. There's an absolute risk involved here, but, if Wentz can stay healthy, the Eagles were able to sign a player that was almost MVP not 2 years ago at a cost that will absolutely be lower than most other QBs that are currently on rookie deals (Mahomes, Watson, Goff, maybe Dak) and will be a smaller percentage of the cap when it actually kicks in as opposed to what it would be now (if the cap ceiling keeps rising like it has been). Simply put, it's a team friendly deal in that they're signing him now and not next year, but it certainly benefits Wentz with all of the guaranteed money and injury risk involved. It's a compromise.",nfl

"I didn't really start watching football until the 2001 season (one of my friends got me to start watching more because his least favorite Patriot had just gotten hurt -- Drew Bledsoe), but I had a vague recollection of having gone to a game before that with a different friend.

I didn't remember too much about that game, except for the very end (which caused me to wonder if I was just making it up).  The Patriots scored as time ran out to take the lead, and the other team just walked off the field rather than line up to contest the extra point.  I was low enough down to the bowl to see the Patriots coach sprint down the sideline yelling at the team to go for two, and they did indeed jog the snap into the undefended end zone.

Hue Jackson would have coached the Broncos to 12 - 13 wins those years.

I would say 2002 - 2006 was when he was an actually good head coach. Also he was a fine defensive coordinator, but he was pretty unremarkable as a head coach.

"Those years were still pretty shaky. People here are misremembering the quality of the Colts simply due to the season record, while forgetting that for every shocking, come from behind win we got due to heroics by Luck and Hilton, we would have a game where we would get blown out by 30 points by a bottom feeder like the Rams. Additionally, this was the peak of the “LoL AFC South” years, so that helped fill out the wins.

Yeah, Peyton was still amazing, but also keep in mind that Luck was absolutely eaten alive in those seasons. Between the porous O Line, and Pagano/Hamilton led nothing-but-7 step dropback offense, Luck was consistently among the most hit QBs in the league, which is why he is already so beat up at this point in his career. And that’s despite being a pretty mobile QB. Asking an aging Peyton to do the same thing after coming back from an injury like he had would have been disastrous. It would have destroyed whatever remaining years he had left and we would have had some middling years with no real success to talk about, only to then have to look for a Peyton successor anyways.",nfl

"See? Was it so hard to not be a dick and give some hard evidence? 

QB rating: No defense for Dak's 2017 - he was simply not as good as his other two seasons. However, after the acquisition of Amari Cooper, Dak's QB rating increased to 102, in line with Wentz's best. 

I discussed both passing and rushing TDs, because that is such a major part of Dak's game and the difference between the two. You could argue that Cowboys play-calling/ Dak's rushing ability being the reason he doesn't have as many passing TDs, just as you want to argue that Eagles play-calling prevents Wentz's rushing TDs. 

You can absolutely give the most important position some credit when it comes to win-loss. I mean you can just look at last season - 3-4 for Dak when he was not playing well, 7-2 when he was. It's not the end all be all - we see bad QBs get in the playoffs every year with a stacked defense. However, QB play is definitely an incredibly important contributing factor in overall team success - hence why these dudes are even in the conversation for $30+ million contracts.

I also think you're missing the overall point of this - I'm not arguing that Wentz is bad or that Prescott is better and more deserving. I think we both understand by the stats presented that their overall statlines aren't far apart in the major categories, with each being better at different things. The takeaway is that if you believe the Wentz contract is earned, then Dak's would be as well.",nfl

* Improvisation
* Pocket Awareness
* Anticipation
* Arm Strength

"James Brooks was a stud RB in the late 70s, early 80s.  One of the most interesting findings recently related to the dramatic drop in crime across the country beginning in early 90s, was the impact of removing leaded gasoline in the early 70s.  Lead has a pernicious affect on the development of young brains causing all sorts of problems - inability to concentrate, impulse control, etc. So the 20 yr olds in the 1990s when young men are most likely to commit crimes were not as exposed to the negative effects of lead and as a consequence, crime went down.  

There has also been some interesting and compelling research recently on the effects of poverty in general on brain development of kids.  

So, I agree, that some communities have more of an issue, but it's a more complex issue than just looking at a location.  It may be a factor of where they live (poor communities tend to still have old lead based paint on the walls, lead in the water - see Flint, MI) and poverty all stacking the odds against these kids.",nfl

I know I personally would have wanted the man to coach WRs if i could talk him into it and he was good at it in retirement. I can't honestly think of a benefit to grtting that million back from him. Had it been more money, and maybe prohibiting an actual signing then sure, talk to CJ and try to free up your cap amiably first, then strong arm knowing you are right. This just looks petty to me",nfl

"In his mind, the cliff theory was proven correct this past year. I avoid watching his videos at this point for obvious reasons but last I saw, he claimed that this season validated the cliff theory because Tom Brady wasn’t an MVP candidate anymore.

So, he has been proved wrong about it over and over again but rather than admit he was wrong (which I doubt anyone actually expected), he retconned his original statement. I’m pretty sure the initial statement was that Brady would have a sudden and drastic drop in ability but now Kellerman claims the cliff is defined as the drop from MVP candidate to... I guess whatever he think of Brady as now.

"Thin talent pool funneling to the top. There are not many career paths that can potentially lead to running an NFL Front Office. MLB has a much larger scouting and development infrastructure and former minor league and major league players who might enter the talent pool. NBA I think has a similar issue to the NFL with a narrow talent pool for front office leadership though.

Experience in other fields is not easily translatable to front office success. And without a major branch like MLB has to minor league coaches, scouts, assistants, and players the talent pipeline narrows.",nfl
"Wentz is a great player, but @EaglesFans, if he has another season ending injury this year, what is your perspective?

I had assumed the Eagles were going to let the year play out before they went to the table with serious contract negotiations - Wentz can play at a borderline MVP level, but the injuries should be a building concern in the organization.  A nice clean 16 game season without a major injury would really help build long term confidence in this investment.

It would be one thing if Wentz had freak injuries, but to me I think his play style is a major contributing factor to the ones he's sustained, he is too willing to take contact for a top-of-market type of QB IMO, and this is just risky.",nfl

"Eddie Jackson was out against the Eagles.

Nick Foles is a SB MVP. Acting like he's David Fales is intellectually dishonest. And I love that 25/40 266 YDS, 2 TD, 2 INT is throwing all over, but Trubisky's better statline is bad. Stop pretending. You're a hater.",nfl

"Coming from an (unbiased) Rams fan, there was a few reasons the defense “underperformed”. 

The addition of Marcus Peters underwhelmed, but should look better this year. Peters has played in almost exclusively zone defenses up to this point in his career, and Wade runs a lot of press man, forcing Peters to play the receiver much more than the ball, limiting his turnover upside.

This was coupled with the Talib injury. When Talib was on the field, the defense as a whole allowed something like 8 PPG less then when he was hurt. Talib is also a renowned press man corner. When he played, it allowed Them to run more combo coverages involving Peters playing in off man or zone which he’s more comfortable in.

LaMarcus Joyner also drastically underperformed at FS as opposed to 2017. He was constantly misreading route combinations or overplaying/guessing wrong leading to some big plays downfield.

Another big thing was they were gashed in the run game almost every week. It is widely known that Wade sacrifices run defense for pass defense, and this was the prime example of it. He allows his DL to be as disruptive as possible, sometimes foregoing gap assignments in favor of penetration, thus putting a lot of pressure on the off ball linebackers. Cory Littleton was a first year starting LB who has a knack for finding the ball, but showed his inexperience in shedding blocks to maintain his gap assignments. At the other LB spot you had Barron, a safety/LB hybrid whose size makes it hard for him to take on blocks regardless. 

Then you throw in the fact that their starting EDGE defenders week 1 were Samson Ebukam and Matt Longacre/Dominique Easley. The Fowler addition helped in this regard, but still left something to be desired. As a whole, Donald accounted for over 50% of their sack totals which puts entirely too much pressure on him to perform in those long down/distance and late game situations.


As a whole, I agree with you that they should positively regress they were average at best last year but they have aggressively tried to get guys to fit Wades scheme recently, and if they don’t work out I am confident Les Snead will make a move for a guy to help them in their deficiency.

Obviously other QBs can and have done this but Brady has done all of them at a HoF level while also doing all the other QB stuff like reading defenses amazingly too.

"EP is a language structure that allows for the same plays to be quickly called from multiple formations, because everyone knows every route in the concept.

That ""language structure"" and the understanding demanded of all the players who operate in that ""language structure"" is a big part of adjusting quickly and getting matchups like Edelman/Beasely on a linebacker, then keeping that defensive grouping on the field.

"Yeah, I love it so much.  I jumped 4.35m in college (around 14'3.25"") but suffered from some lack of competition and distracted coaching my junior/senior year.

"I'm down with ab. But not Hopkins. How about Julio, Beckham,  AB, Evans, Hopkins. Realistically those 5 could be in any order. There is argument for and against them all. 

Evans  huge first 5 years to start a career. Touchdowns could be a little higher. I think hes gonna have a huge year. 

Julio undeniable talent and big yardage numbers but sucks in the red zone. Touchdowns are the most important thing in football and Julio doesn't catch enough TDs 

Beckham catches crazy balls. Injury prone possibly? Locker room cancer ? Crazy ? I don't like the browns but I'd like to see him do well. Fun to watch. 

AB What can you say. Big numbers. Total Diva.  I'm not convinced he's gonna succeed as a raider. 

Hopkins.  He's  a talent. I've never cared for him tbh tho. Great receiver, don't really know why I don't like him. Catches a lot of balls.  I still put him 5th tbh. He's boring to watch imo.",nfl

"I've been blaming them for awhile now, actually. There's no way it's just luck - I did a deep dive on Football Outsiders' ""Adjusted Games Lost"" metric (which is a pretty good judge of how teams are affected by injuries) over the past decade or so, and with the sole exception of 2013, the Skins have been in the top 12 most injured teams every single year (and the last three have been exceptionally bad).

However, I think there's more to it than just the training/medical staff. Honestly, I think it has more to do with the fact that we draft and sign guys who are undervalued because of injury or just have big histories of injuries. Jordan Reed, Chris Thompson, Derrius Guice, Jonathan Allen, RG3, Paul Richardson, Reuben Foster, Josh Doctson, just to name a few, all had injury histories before we drafted or signed them. And lo and behold, they've all had significant injuries since joining the team. Coincidence?",nfl
"Yeah ultimately comparing the two is just nitpicking really. I guess my main argument was based on style of play, as you mentioned it just depends which style you prefer. And I was pretty vague with the term speed rush, but bend and dip is really what I was trying to get at. Miller's ability to bend the edge is just insane. Mack's is outstanding, but the bend Miller gets is on another level. They are 1a and 1b right now imo when it comes to edge defenders. And it's up for debate which one belongs where.",nfl
"I don’t read through all comments before commenting. But here are a few others that have been problem: David Irving, Jay Ratliff, even Williams from the Vikings had issues. There are plenty that have been problems. Even Donald has had his ass hat moments like when he put his helmet on and ran across the field after a game to start a fight. So there are plenty.",nfl
"Except Floyd was in a club. And Shaheen was out. Replay that game at the end of the season with a more comfortable Mitch and Bears don’t lose-you could see it in his eyes he was overwhelmed on that finale drive.

 Two of our losses could be directly contributed to injuries: Mack playing hurt and thus ineffective against Miami, and Trubisky out against the Giants.

The Bears also brought in a new training staff last year, there were several articles about it even at the beginning of the season, their current trainer is a soft tissue guru...Some injuries are just bad luck or freaks of nature, others are prevented with a good staff and training program, and the Bears have fixed a lot of the soft tissue injury issues they had under John Fox.

Edit: for example, they put in sand pits last year and made other changes to their program",nfl
"Personally, I think so. But you never know. Chip was an offensive guru and yes, had the unique approach to sports science and tempo that most others had not adopted.

It's also possible that chip was doomed regardless due to his coaching approach. He is one of those hard ass, no nonsense guys. Sometimes that just doesn't work out in the pros.

But, we will never know because he failed miserably as a HC/GM combo. I just hate when I see people say chip failed all around as a HC in the NFL. Cause that just is not true.",nfl

"Howie has an impressive draft resume for sure. Our drafts lately have been stellar imo. 

Everyone has misses but getting solid depth/role players in the 3rd round and beyond has been something Howie has nailed. Vaitai won a Superbowl at LT for us, Maddox is a 4th rounder, Seumalo In the 3rd, Clement UDFA, etc. And he's a fucking genius at cap management. Really excited for the rest of Carson's career. If he stays healthy we could be looking at another run of deep playoff runs, a-la Andy Reid, hopefully with more hardware to show for it",nfl
"I excluded those because it would open up a giant can of worms with teams that played one-off games (like the Vikings in 2010 and the Bills in 2014 in Detroit, the Chargers in 2003 in Arizona, etc.)

"Fantastic? Are you serious? Schobert missed games due to injury, led the NFL in missed tackles, played like shit against the run all year long, and wasn’t effective at making plays sideline to sideline. Just because PFF thought he graded well doesn’t mean he actually played well last season. The same people who thought Schobert was good thought Derrick Henry was the second best RB in football last year. Take PFF grades with a grain of salt. I like Schobert as a person, but he’s more of a game managing talent than a game changing talent, if that makes sense. He’s not as good as PFF says he is and Joe is wothout question the most overrated player on the team. If Joe plays like he did last year, he’s not getting a contract extension, no matter what fans or PFF says. He’s mediocre, nothing more.",nfl
"Right? I'm just thinking about what I would have done if I were in a position, at 19, where everyone in my life was encouraging me to put something above school, to the point where I'd pass even if I didn't go to class.

Lets go through a few more random hypotheticals with nothing solid behind it, sounds like a logical way to behind a comparison",nfl
"Kind of depends. Are we talking about this season exclusively, or NFL careers as a whole? Short's  coming off a career worst season, but that's mostly because our DL broadly lacked talent last year and he saw consistent double and triple teams.

"I'm a Raiders fan and *I* found that game hard to watch. 

But it was classic Marty-ball. It was the playoffs and instead of doing what had worked all season, he lost his mind at the most inopportune times. Then there were the uncharacteristic player mistakes at the worst possible times. 

You guys were the best team in the league that year, and it really was a loss you never recovered from.",nfl
"Me too. Only it was the NFC Championship game. And I’m a Seahawks fan. One of the best days of my life. Wilson threw the ball to Kearse in the end zone we were sitting in. I had been to the NFC Championship game the year before, in the same seats. When they flipped the coin and we knew they were going to have to score at our end, I turned to my boyfriend (fiancé now) and said “they are going to score a TD right here and end the game.” I was right ��",nfl
"2015 NFC Wildcard round, Seattle @ Minnesota. Played outside at the Gophers' TCF Bank Stadium.

At -10F, it was the third coldest game played in NFL history. And the Vikings set themselves up to win it- until Blair Walsh missed the chip shot walk-off field goal in the last seconds.

Until the final moment, it was an absolute blast.",nfl
"So, I am not saying this is likely (at all), but it's more possible than previous years.  

The key is: the Patriots seem to have a weaker offensive roster, and Brady is 42 (so they could decline); the Bills have a solid, perhaps elite defense a brewin'; Bills could stomp the Dolphins for their 2 games a year; and Jets may have a Gase-shitshow brewing.

But, if anything, if the Pats fell off, I would think the Jets are the one who could eke out the 10-6 division win.  I think Allen is an intriguing QB, but isn't good enough to carry that offense, and the Bills are well coached, but again: not enough to win with that roster.  

So, it's not as hot-taeky as perhaps in previous years, but it's still just nagonnahappen.",nfl
"The Cowboys are like the Ottoman Empire right before it collapsed. A great power that got too complacent, suffered several soul crushing defeats, and allowed their decadent rulers to continue to make horrible decisions. Because they are always in the mix each season they continue to ""appear"" as a threat when, in reality, they're as predictable as a ferris wheel. They need a horrible season in order for things to get better, but they'll continue to lie to themselves that everything is going to be okay and let Opie Taylor call their plays.",nfl
"Another thing to consider is that throwing power is generated by more than just the arm. With pitchers, they stand alone on the mound and go through their whole windup uninterrupted. 

Its a bit different with Brady in the pocket. Of course Brady gets the ball out of his hands super fast, but that might compromise his power.",nfl
"I watched some old playoff games from the 80s recently and the thing that stuck out to me was how FAST it was. Not necessarily speed on the field, but the pace of play. I watched a game that had only two! penalties in the whole game. And there were fewer commercial breaks. It was just go, go, go.",nfl
"People just don't understand how much more defenders (especially DBs and Safety) had to work with back then, they could get in WRs face and rough em up. So more INTs happened back then. 

Today you can't even put a fucking hand on them. Hence why there is less INTs now compared to older QBs,  if anything it just shows how good Marino, Montana,young were.",nfl
"With that in mind, has there ever been a case where a position is never been selected at a draft spot. Like could the number one pick be full of QBs and edge rushers, but then have no receivers or line backers? Just as an example.

**EDIT** Ok, so there was only one receiver taken first overall and no defensive backs. That team isn’t going to be very good.",nfl
"In Brady's defense, they had 3 WRs that game. Not 3 good WRs, 3 guys who were able to dress and are listed as WRs. All we had to do was double Gronk and not fuck up against a bunch of 3rd string WRs.

"�� here we go

Edit:
Fact: members of the ‘09 Vikings team have said that they also had a bounty system in place.

Opinion: as shitty as the bounty system is/was, the Saints got what they deserved, they paid a high penalty for having a bounty system. I have seen nothing that proves that the bounty system actually changed the outcome of games. Defensive players make hard hits all the time, with or without a bounty system. The egregious part is that they would get paid incentives when an injury happened. 

But guess what? Favre never left the game. So even without the bounty system, the outcome of the game stays the same. Brett got injured a lot during his career, he always played through it, and he always had that gunslinger mentality and play style.  The 2009 NFCCG was no different.

"Why dock Fant, a 1st rounder, for being unproven? If he's anywhere near as good as projected he'll be a top 5 or 10 TE in the league. It's more likely that he'll be reasonably good than a bust.
  
Same with Butt. He was one of (if not *the*) best TE in college a couple years ago. He hasn't done anything with the Broncos because A) he's been injured, and B) he had Case Keenum, a shitty offense and bad coaching for the only 3 games he's played. He hasn't a chance to show us his skill one way or the other. But based on his college career, I suspect he'll be good...  
  

So we have two young guys who were both among the best tight ends in college, plus Heurmann.  Based on *potential* ours could be one of the best TE rooms in the NFL. But you're sort of ranking the Broncos based on a *wort-case* scenario happening for all the unknowns, which is probably unlikely.
  
So I think hedging that by ranking them in the middle is fair. If they meet our expectations they'll be one of the best. If everything goes to shit they'll be among the worst (which goes for any team, really) so I see nothing wrong with putting them in the middle for now.",nfl

"Players watch film too. AV is just as likely to forget how to get depth in his drop step as he is to forget how to break down film and plan for the next opponent. It obviously won't be at the same level without Munchak, but with Sarrett and the veterans in the room, they're in good hands and I think people are trying to make themselves panic a little too much.",nfl

"Cliff Notes version: The NFL used to push big hits and headhunting as part of what made the NFL fun. They had commercials about it, NFL Films would have big hits highlight shows and the NFL would have all of their advertising partners and promoters (ESPN, Madden) show big hits as part of the NFL. Then as the NFL was getting sued they pulled back on all the big hits as part of the NFL experience.",nfl
"The thought process is that rushing a lot is less likely to convert for a 1st down, which results in shorter drives. Look at the number of total passing yards/totals pass attempts vs rushing yards per rush attempt. Y/A for passing in 2018 was 7.4 compared to  4.4.

Statistically you’re more likely to convert 1st Downs and extend drives by passing than rushing. Don’t believe me? Ask fans of teams that rush a lot. Run-run-pass is detested by everyone for leading to a lot of 3andouts",nfl
"New York loves Gregg Williams now! 

In all seriousness, the G Williams hate has always been overblown. Is he an SOB on the football field? Without a doubt. 

The people on this sub take that and turn it in to Gregg Williams literally being a horrible human being. Fuck those people. I am sorry you like a gladiator sport and need to project your guilt onto others. 

But Gregg fucking Williams runs a charity for at risk youth and has contributed millions of dollars to better his community.

"(TL;DR I found nothing)


Trying to find just a window of time for this: 


Tebow: 2010 to 2013 preseason and 2015 (Misses 2013 Regular season and all of 2014 before returning to Eagles.)
Bridgewater: 2014-2015 Returns 2017 to present (Missed all of 2016, preseason as well) 

If you look at those two you think ""OK 2015.""

Jake Locker: 2011 - 2014

Wait, what?  

Jake Locker retired March 10 2015, the Eagles wouldn't sign Tebow until April 20, 2015. But with Teddy on the list we can't go back before 2014

Vince Young: 2006-2014

Now I add one more person, Vince Young. He was still bouncing around the league then. Signed with the Browns May 1, 2014 and released May 12, 2014. 

----


I now think this is before the start of the 2015 preseason, and we have someone taking a look back at previous years. No Jamies or Marriotta on the list, who were drafted April 2015. The 2014 Draft featured Teddy B. Mentioning the weirdness around the signing dates mentioned above I think this might even be pre draft and this guy is just taking a look. 

Playoffs? I don't think so. Simply because Tom Brady is at 1. (Deflategate was a whole year behind us, and the report would be published in May of 2015). Meanwhile, I do believe that a good number of those players had never even played in a playoff game by that point in their career. 

Nothing yet. Lets keep digging. (At this point I'd also consider perhaps this was written during the 2014 preseason, but that raises some questions about timing and stuff as Teddy is on the list, so it has to be after he has some sort of NFL action, even preseason, in combo with the fact that Tebow hadn't been on a roster since Aug 2013. My gut says 2015 still.) 

Sexy Rexy: 2003-2015 (The Cleveland Browns signed Grossman on August 12, 2014 and cut him on August 31, 2014. The Falcons signed him August 26, 2015 and cut him September 4, 2015) 

The Sex Cannon hadn't seen regular season action since 2011.

And one more piece of confusion, Mr. Tyler Palko, who throws a wrench into everything. 

Tyler Palko: UDFA signed in 2007, released Aug 2008. Preseason 2009. Then 2010 and 2011 with the Chiefs where he saw his first taste of the NFL regular season. 

----

Yup, I'm lost now. No idea wtf is going on. I thought I was making progress buy Palko just totally fucked me. Also, his wikipedia page says: 

&gt; [It is believed by many that Palko is the key missing piece to solving the PFT commenter riddle. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Palko#2011)

Which has me confused as I have no idea what that is about, and I'm not jumping down that rabbit whole just yet. 

Back to the issue at hand I'm totally lost. I see QBs from what are presumably rookies to guys like Manning and Brady who are roughly 100 years old in NFL years when this was made. So it doesn't have to do with draft class. Nor draft position, I see a bunch of rounds and even UDFAs on the list. Also, it's not a college thing, as I see a bunch of conferences represented. 

----

I combed through some stat lines and I got nothing so far. I'm thinking it's likely something very specific like a home or away INTs thrown or something like that. I don't think it will show up on a regular stat search, especially since I think this may be relative to the QBs most recent year starting or something crazy like that.


Edit: Really which I saw this before I started: https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/c06wp5/brb_this_has_been_going_around_twitter_this/er2tjr8/

"Texans first regular season game ever in 2002 vs Dallas - 19-10 win.
I was a life long Oilers fan and had lost interest in the NFL after they left. Family and friends had split their loyalties among the Packers, Saints, Tennessee and Dallas. Not me, I could never be a fan of any of those teams, it was just too heartbreaking to have lost our home team (screw you Bud). 
Somehow, a local guy named Bob McNair was able to get a group together and nab a franchise expansion even though the NFL was practically begging LA to take it. Thus the Texans were born. I bought the PSL and season tickets, toured the new stadium next to the Dome as it was being built, but it wasn't the same.
First regular season game was surreal. It was like going out of town and cheering for another team. All I knew was that we were playing Dallas and would most likely get whipped. As the game wore on and the possibility that this team would pull it off, I actually got quieter. Once the game was done, I remember just standing there, like, this is what I missed. Goose pimples. It was awesome.
Yeah, Carr got pummeled the rest of the season and we looked like an expansion team, but damn...what a way to kick off the franchise",nfl
"While Dan Snyder  is a scummy person and overall human being I feel like majority of these don’t translate to the on field. One could make the argument its a top down mentality and his toxicity affects his whole staff but frankly been loving the football decisions of the FO of late.

I think better points would have been:

1. how players contracts have been handled especially with Free Agents (Norman and Collins being the top paid DBs at their positions for example) because of a perpetual “win now” mentality because everyone is afraid to lose their job.

2. The handling of Cousins contract talks. I don’t think Kirk deserved the contract he got but we paid Smith close to the same and traded a young talented CB in Kendall Fuller for him. In addition the whole Kurt thing was completely unprofessional. 

3. The whole injury plague we’ve been fighting could also very well be related to his cheapness. Though the story goes they brought out consultants to try fix that so there is that.

Overall Sydner is definitely the worst owner for the reasons you listed but I do not agree we are the worse run team.",nfl
"Wait what? Wilson has never had a season statistically better than Luck when they both play.  

The other names yes but Brees and Brady are sure fire hall of famers but they are 40+. 


I would say The argument for Rodgers is a strong one and he would probably win in a poll of who is better but I vote Luck personally although I see why most would vote Rodgers. 

Matt Ryan to me is the most fair debate comparison.",nfl

"Lol it’s crazy. He’s an incredible prospect, but people have this weird hate boner for him. This sub is horrible at doing that.

When you try to be as objective as you can, Kyler is a very impressive prospect who deserved to go 1. I liked baker more due to is polish and anticipation, but baker played over 1000 more live snaps in CFB than Kyler did so it’s just nuts to me that people think Kyler is topped out. 

He’s also been doubling sports his whole career. Had he only focused on football, he would’ve been even better - he’s very coachable.

"&gt;That doesn't mean it was an illegal activity. It's sex between two consenting adults.

I doubt he'll be convicted of the misdemeanor because the video evidence was ruled inadmissible.  But Jan 20th, Kraft walked into a message parlor at 10:59am, paid cash at the front desk to Lei Wang, took off all his clothing, laid face up on a massage table, and at 11:02, Wang was touching and rubbing his penis and testicles and then appeared to perform oral sex on him for several minutes, then wiped up the area of his genitals with a white towel, helped him get dressed.  Then he gave her a $100 bill and at least one other unidentifiable bill and he left at 11:13am.  

The police also have the same woman sexually servicing 5 other men who went to that parlor that day (and video evidence of similar behavior other days).  

If the evidence wasn't illegally obtained, it would have been slam dunk evidence of soliciting prostitution.  It's [illegal (midemeanor) to solicit or procure prostitution in Florida](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0700-0799/0796/Sections/0796.07.html):

&gt;“Prostitution” means the giving or receiving of the body for sexual activity for hire but excludes sexual activity between spouses. [...]

&gt; (d) “Sexual activity” means oral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the sexual organ of another; anal or vaginal penetration of another by any other object; or the handling or fondling of the sexual organ of another for the purpose of masturbation; however, the term does not include acts done for bona fide medical purposes.

Kraft won't get the slap on the wrist from the potential misdemeanor, but he did it (and if he disputes the police's narrative of their video evidence, he'd want it released).

"He is literally statistically worse, what are you talking about.  The burden of proof to show that the supporting cast is the difference is on people supporting Brady.  When removing the dome from the equation and looking at road games alone, theyve both split the amount of seasons theyve had the edge in the overlapping seasons they played.  What else is there? Manning had better receivers, Brady has a better running O due in part to a solid RB rotation that does better than a workhorse, and in part to the better line that makes it work.  Brady also had the better defense and the better coaching, both from the HC perspective, and the OCs he had for the entirety of his career",nfl
"The difference being is that Brady still had a lot of time to score. He just failed to answer back in his losses.

"The Mara’s loyalty to Gettleman makes him pretty safe at least until Jones has a full season at QB. 

Why would Bidwell suddenly fire Keim now? Especially after getting Kliff and Murray? 

I can see Licht getting fired but why exactly is Tampa Bay’s current situation better than the Jets? 

My flair aside, your three examples are pretty bad examples if you want to support the dumpster fire thesis. Arizona just moved on from a rookie coach and rookie QB after 1 season, is that stable? Tampa Bay has a huge question mark at QB depending on how 19-20 shakes out (and a HC in his 70s) and the Giants/Gettleman just drafted the heir apparent and is likely taking that luxury out of the hands of an incoming GM. 

The Jets have their fair share of problems, but you’re sort of comparing stale apples to stale apples here.",nfl

"It's not the pass-catching, it's recognizing that elite athleticism combined with size at that particular position is a mismatch nightmare for defenses and exploiting it time and time again. He could go up for balls defenders couldn't get to and he had to be brought down by 2+ defenders almost every time. There have been good receiving TEs but they were still generally used as a safety net checkdown or red zone target, which plenty of offenses still stick to. But using the tight end to completely disrupt a defensive scheme and bring an LB or DB out of position was not a primary strategy.",nfl
"Walked on to an offense featuring Larry Fitzgerald (23), Edgerrin James (28), and Anquan Boldin (26), and proceeded to throw 11 TDs and 12 INTs with a 4-7 record. I don't know if a young QB has ever thoroughly blown an opportunity as good as that one.

This is unnecessarily doom and gloom in my opinion, and franchising a kicker who is as dependable as Gould as a stopgap to better evaluate kicking prospects since we couldn’t get a long term deal done really isn’t that big of a deal, or a reflection on Lynch’s ability as a gm.

"It’s because people stopped buying newspapers. 

When newspapers first started building websites, the paper was still *the* product, so the website was treated as an afterthought. But then came smartphones and 24/7 web access, and people realized they didn’t need to buy the paper because most of it was online for free. 

Unfortunately all the decision makers at the top of the pile were/are old and stuck in their ways, so it took a while for companies to start monetizing the web. Now people complain that they are asked to pay for something they used to pay for anyway, even though an online subscription is hella cheap compared to what a print subscription used to cost. 

I say this as a journalist who has, in only a 13-year career, watched my first publication drop from 25,000 print subscribers to about 7,000. And because the decision makers waited way too long to charge for website access, the newsroom has been reduced from about 20 to nine journalists, which obviously impacts both quantity and quality of production in terrible ways.

I really had no way to know you'd be 5 on the list, seems a bit over the top to expect me to know that. I saw the days as a mod, your other modded subs (which holy shit there are a lot), and the context of your posts.

How come you don't just blow off this portion of the job? I don't think any of the other mods would mind if you just did the CSS and design, that's a heavy load as is for the 0 dollars a year salary plus benefits.

Anyway, sorry for stirring you up. I was confused and a bit aggressive about it. I didn't feel I was acting I knew anything better than you, just that I didn't find this to be consistent with my experience, and after visiting the rules, felt it was vague.

"Mojo's rookie season with Fred Taylor was also one of the best running back duos ever. I don't think it was quite as good as the NO boys, but Mojo was like 60 yards short of 1000 rushing and Fred was over. They combined for 2k rushing yards.

Fred's total yards per scrimmage was 1388, 5.5 yards per touch and 6 TDs. Mojo was 1377 yards, 6.5 yards per touch and 15 TD.

So... Yeah the Saints duo is far and away the best...but that 2006 season with a veteran Fred and rookie Mojo sort of parallels that and it was one of the best RB duos ever",nfl
The Chiefs compared them when they drafted him as a potential replacement for Hill. The only thing this article does is ask if he can at all fill those shoes which literally everyone agrees is the entire point of him as a pick... Hell it doesn't even ask if he can be a full-formed current Hill but if he can even hope to match the production of a 600 yard 6 TD rookie Hill. Whatever you're reading that suggests anything in the affirmative of Hardman actually potentially being on Hill's level isn't written in this article.,nfl

"Look at his stat lines in Super Bowls, then look at Brady’s. 

Peyton has the label of choking in the playoffs because many people watched his entire career instead of looking at a boxscore and know he repeatedly played under his usual level and crumbled in big moments.  

If you’re going to give him credit for dragging a poor team to the playoffs like everyone who defends him loves to do then you have to acknowledge that his underwhelming play played a big part in 9 one and dones(!) and barely being above .500 in the postseason.

This is ignoring that Brady has a couple of absolute monster legacy games where he came back down 2 scores in the 4th against the LOB, 25 pt comeback, most yards and completions in a SB, etc",nfl
"No way man, it's cornerback.  Mathieu immediately helps with the safety position, and I'm really high on Thornhill.  Meanwhile I think Hitchens is better than we saw last season, and Lee should help there too.  Meanwhile we have a really good slot corner as our #1, an UDFA going into his second season as our #2 or #3 and while I think Breeland is better than people give him credit for, we could use a true #1.

Going back to linebacker, they always under-performed under Sutton with the exception of DJ, who honestly had the talent to be a top-3 ILB.  That means that we either couldn't evaluate talent at the position, or we couldn't coach/scheme the position.  Seeing that we drafted several ILBs, brought some in through FA, and traded for some, my guess is that we couldn't coach/scheme the position.  I think Hitchens will look more like he did in Dallas this season.",nfl
"I kind of agree with the way you're defining things. There were years where the Colts, Broncos, or Pats got upset and were one and done but were clearly relevant teams viewed as serious SB contenders right up until they were eliminated.

Conversely there have been years where, say, the Titans, Chiefs, or Jags (I'm not referring to 2017 here) won a first round game but were never viewed as serious SB contenders, and with good reason.

Fair enough to describe the first category of teams as more relevant than the 2nd.

The thing is, I disagree with your conclusion vis a vis the Cowboys: while by your (and my) standard the Redskins really haven't been relevant even once this century, the Cowboys have definitely been relevant at *least* twice (2016 and 2014) and you'd probably throw 2007 (13-3 with a +130 point differential) and possibly 2009 or 2014 (+111 and +115 point differentials, respectively) in there as well.

Have the Cowboys been *consistently* relevant over the last two decades like the Steelers, Packers, or Pats? Heck no. They're behind quite a few other teams as well in terms of how often they've been relevant (including the Colts, Broncos, Ravens, and Seahawks). But they've had their years. The Redskins haven't.",nfl
"Eh, I wouldn't sweat it too much. It's all part of the game. Take some solace in that Carson Wentz is somehow at least as injury prone as Romo.

Wentz has to have Jaylon Smith and DLaw coming at him for the foreseeable future. Eagles fans better hope these Wentz injuries are just one fluke after another, otherwise we can just transfer all the Romo/Sean Lee jokes over that way.",nfl
"Oh I see. She definitely needs to retire soon. She sounds like a dinosaur that is unwilling to evolve or change her ways.

"Which is kinda fucky, right? Presumably at least some of the rankers know the final list, but they’ve still been going on with their mantra “This list was made without positional importance.”

 If you know that an inordinate number of QB’s landed in the top half of this list, how can you say the rankings are done objectively without positional bias? Seems... well, “dishonest” seems a bit harsh, but they’re certainly not debating this list’s quality in good faith.",nfl

well yeah obviously it's not better than all of bradys playoff games it's just weird that's the one you'd choose to discredit considering how it matches up historically as like the 12th or 13th highest passer rating ever in a playoff game and palmers injury not really effecting the flow of the game nearly as you make it out,nfl

"Which is fine. But why throw into the teeth of the defense? At the time, Wilson was much better rolling out. It gave him far more options when it came to running or passing and allowed him the chance to throw it away.

Regardless of Lynch's attempts that season, though, they still had a timeout and 2 plays after that. No reason not to run in that situation.",nfl
He had a contract dispute I think and was benched around that same time for being late to a meeting but I don't recall much else. Jackson wasn't really much of a locker room problem besides that and has spoken well of Reid multiple times so I don't know that this dude's comment holds water,nfl
"That isn't the point. Let's say it takes five years to turn your roster around to where they are playoff contenders. Seems reasonable especially given the terrible quality of the current roster and the rest of the NFCs positioning. Barkley will be 27 at that point in time. Last year he touched the ball 350 times. So he'll have around 1600 touches by that point, potentially more given that he looks to be the only offensive threat on the team. At this point in the NFL, 27 is old for a running back, even elite ones. Even if Barkley is good then, you have maybe a year or two with him on that contender roster before he's done. 

Now compare that to a QB like Darnold. He'll also be 27 then, but that's completely different for a QB. For them that's right around the entry to the prime of their career. At that point, you'd conceivably have another 5-10 years with him as the starting option before even having to consider getting his replacement. THAT is why it's a bad pick to have taken Barkley. Not because he is a bad player, but because the return you get is useless and by the time he WOULD be valuable to have, it'll be too late.",nfl
"Chargers being slept on because of their poor performance in game 2 of the playoffs last year against the super bowl winner.

This is a team that was third overall in DVOA last year which INCLUDES that poor playoff game against the Patriots (who as we know had a dominant defensive performance in the playoffs against multiple good offenses). They were top ten defensively and top ten offensively AND they’re the rare playoff team that actually projects to be more healthy next year than the previous year. On top of that, their biggest weakness is special teams (25th overall DVOA) which is something that can definitely improve a ton from one year to the next due to shifting personnel and assignments. 

And their coach is considered quite good too. They’re being slept on because of the playoff blowout but this is probably gonna be a team that’s really damn good on both sides of the ball and will be a super bowl contender (unless Rivers gets hurt).",nfl
Story time. When I was a freshmen in high school in 2005 his school was playing ours on a night that was pouring down rain. He was already know as one of the best high school players in the country at this time. The game plan was to not kick it to him EVER! First kick off goes straight to him. runs it back. 7-0 with 14:50 left in the first quarter. I left at half time when we were loosing 40-0. game ended like 60-10 and he had like 4 td's before they pulled him.,nfl

Yep. He's very clearly a team first dude and you have to love the competitive spirit - I certainly do. I just think we have trouble separating that from his actual play. I'm fully expecting him to play the second he can and I'm going to be so frustrated given the amount of enticing options available to us,nfl
"It's looking more and more like the situation with Hill isn't as bad as initially thought.  It just came out that investigators and medical professionals believe the child broke his arm as a ""result of typical accident involving a rambunctious toddler, consistent with reaching out to brace for a fall.""

Hill is going to get a suspension from the audio tape, but my guess is it's between 4 and 6 games.  Watkins when healthy isn't a bad receiver by any means.  If you extrapolate his yardage from last season over 16 games he would have broken 1000 yards.

We also added Hardman, and while I think a lot of this is preseason hype, they are saying his speed is legit and he's taking to the playbook fast.  Then you have Robinson who has a rapport with Mahomes going back to before Mahomes was the starter.

Then you can't forget about Kelce, who is arguably the best TE in the league, especially with Gronk retiring.  Plus Damien Williams put up some big numbers both on the ground and through the air in his limited time last season.

Missing Hill is going to hurt, but not nearly as bad as it could have been.  If he is suspended 4 games he's going to miss @Jags, @Raiders, Ravens, and @Lions.  It sucks that 3 of the 4 games would be on the road, but the only teams I'm worried about at all is the Ravens, and I'm not high on Jackson.

If he misses 6 it gets trickier because we play the Colts and Texans at home.  Both of those teams are trickier than the first 4 games.  If he misses 8, we are @Broncos and home against Green Bay, which I think are the two hardest games of the first half, Denver, because it's a divisional game, and Green Bay because we don't know how good they will be under LaFleur.  Ten games is the absolute most he would miss, and that would put him out against the Vikings and the Titans.

We don't play the Chargers until games 11 and 17, and the Pats are game 13.",nfl
"Again this doesn’t help your case. The article states multiple times that Gould does not want to be in SF and outlines his reasons for holding out and not reporting .

That’s why everyone is laughing at you. This article just further shows how unhappy Gould is, and you think a little coach speak about how they want him there is somehow confirmation that he’s definitely coming back after the holdout and that this is all according to plan?

"**TL;DR**

&gt;**1. Chris Harris Jr., Broncos:**

&gt;In 2018, Harris was targeted in the slot 36 times, allowing 23 receptions for 217 yards, 104 yards, no touchdowns, two interceptions, and an opposing quarterback rating of 57.3. 



&gt; **2. Kenny Moore II, Colts:**

&gt;Moore was targeted 68 times in the slot in 2018, allowing 54 receptions for 429 yards and 265 yards after the catch. He gave up one touchdown to four interceptions, and allowed an opponent passer rating of 73.3.



&gt;**3. Bryce Callahan, Broncos:**

&gt; Callahan started 10 games and appeared in three more with the Bears last season when he posted a career-best 45 tackles to go with two sacks, two interceptions and six pass breakups. He allowed just one touchdown. In addition, he’s top ten in various statistics including passer rating allowed (eighth), yards per coverage snap (second), and coverage snaps per reception (fifth).



&gt; **4. Minkah Fitzpatrick, Dolphins:**

&gt; When he was deployed in the slot, no other interior pass defender with at least 20% of his team’s snaps at that position allowed a lower opponent passer rating than Fitzpatrick’s 53.4. He allowed just 20 slot receptions on 39 targets for 200 yards, 111 yards after the catch, one touchdown, and two interceptions.



&gt;**5. Desmond King II, Chargers:**

&gt; Last season, King played 768 of his 910 total snaps in the slot, and allowed 51 receptions on 65 targets for 425 yards, 357 yards after the catch, one touchdown, three interceptions, and an opponent passer rating of 79.8.



&gt;**6. Stephon Gilmore, Patriots:**

&gt; Of course, Gilmore is primarily an outside cornerback, and he’s one of the best in the business when it comes to matching up against top receivers. But he’s also dominant in the slot when the Patriots put him there—per Pro Football Focus, he had 27 slot targets in the 2018 season, allowing just 13 catches for 104 yards, 28 yards after the catch, one touchdown, one interception, and an opposing quarterback rating of 55.2.



&gt;**7. Justin Coleman, Lions:**

&gt; A highly aware player with great body control, especially in zone coverage, Coleman allowed 36 receptions on 55 slot targets last season for 362 yards, 296 yards after the catch, one touchdown, one interception, and an opponent passer rating of 82.5 in 2018.



&gt;**8. Mackensie Alexander, Vikings:**

&gt; In 2018, the former second-round pick out of Clemson allowed 35 receptions in 54 slot targets for 337 yards, 234 yards after the catch, no touchdowns, and an opponent passer rating of 82.1.



&gt;**9. Kareem Jackson, Broncos:**

&gt; In 2018, Jackson allowed 26 catches on 40 slot targets for 256 yards, 111 yards after the catch, no touchdowns, one interception, and an opponent passer rating of 72.5.



&gt;**10. Nickell Robey-Coleman, Rams:**

&gt; In 2018, Robey-Coleman allowed just 38 catches on 63 targets for 294 yards, 200 yards after the catch, and an opponent passer rating of 81.1. He’s debited a bit on this list because he was involved in three touchdowns to one interception, but he’s consistently been a guy you want on the inside.



&gt;**11. Sherrick McManis, Bears:**

&gt; In 2018, McManis allowed just 12 receptions on 22 slot targets for 80 yards, 42 yards after the catch, no touchdowns, and an opponent passer rating of 62.7.",nfl

"In the league? These ""generational"" backs come out every year (it was, what, like five straight drafts before this year with a RB people were claiming was the next AD?). Finding another one of those for your team? Sure, that's not a given, but it's pretty easy to get (as the meme on this sub goes) 80% of the production for 20% of the cost. And finding another game changing RB (if not generational) doesn't seem that rare. Kamara, Hunt, Chubb, Conner, and Lindsay all came out of nowhere to be huge contributors over the last two years. The Seahawks have a stable of JAGs and are plenty competitive. The Patriots seemingly pick a new random off the street every year to put up solid numbers. 

Point is, while it's not a guarantee you can find RBs, it really isn't *that* hard if you're willing to invest a 2nd or 3rd every couple of years.",nfl
"Pass blocking stats for different points in a game. Beachum had 581 PB snaps. How many came when the Jets were down 20 and the defense was playing a soft zone instead of blitzing/rushing the passer hard, for example.  I would want contest for those numbers. How many hits did Williams give up because the QB held the ball for 6 seconds?",nfl

"Every day I lose a little more hope for humanity despite seemingly never having any hope left.

I work at a refinery and they're renovating our building.

This site is really old and it turns out that up until the late 70s, people used to just take all of their oil slop waste, walk outside, dump it straight on the fucking ground. Every day. For decades. And now they're digging that ground up and safety basically told us ""tough shit, you'll live"". 

I get that safety standards are a ""new"" thing but I really want to know why people would look at highly flammable, death smelling fuel and go ""Yeah, lets just throw this shit on the ground *right here*."" They didnt even walk away from the building they worked in to do it.

"As a Bengals fan, I just want to let everyone mentioning Joe Mixon know we appreciate you. I promise this will be the last season he is viewed as underrated.

&amp;#x200B;

I really believe he is primed for a big year if we give him the carries he deserves. Much of that is on the coaching staff, but the offensive line will certainly need to hold itself together as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I also believe that we are genuinely prepared for a playoff run with Mixon at the helm of the offense. You may call me crazy or a Bengals homer for that, but I really think this offense is capable of being dangerous. It all comes down to how we put ourselves together this season and how the defense holds up. I hope Mixon gets to do some work in January (and if I'm lucky February) and no longer is thought of as underrated.",nfl

"Could use some advice. 

On Monday, I have one of two remaining onsite interviews. It's for a company not too far from my house and I am already WFH. The interview is in the middle of the day, which is kind of annoying, but it should be a fast one. It's also the final round and they seem to like me, and I like them, and I am going to make sure I am prepared, etc. 

The other onsite is not until a week from today, which is far from ideal due to one of the people being OOO most of the week (both of these interviews had been pushed back due to key people being OOO). I really love the company and really hit it off with the hiring manager on our video call last week. The only thing is they require a presentation or assignment, and I presume there will be a second onsite. My interview is also at 4 pm and is about 10 minutes from my office, which means I have to dip out around 3:30. 

I generally wear suits to interviews; however, there's no way in hell I can show up here next Thursday decked out in a suit. I don't think I can afford to WFH again because there's a good chance I have to WFH on Wednesday to take my wife to her doctor (the appointment is at fucking 2 pm).

"&gt;8\. We think the NFL now has a plethora of reasonable starting quarterbacks outside of the true superstars and any number of them can create top-10 production in any given year.

"I mean Chip was shit with us too. People look at his numbers and say it was just him as GM, but the offense became stale in year 2. Teams were calling out his plays and because he doesn't allow his QB to audible they had to stick in it. There are quotes from Bethea after the 49ers game where he said they knew the plays and were calling them out and that was a game which we lost 26-21 with all 21 points being scored by our defense and social teams units. Cowboys players also said they knew what plays were coming after our game that season. Chip is a shit coach who inherited a good roster and had a system no one saw at the pro level which worked til people got tape.",nfl
James Washington. He showed flashes of extremely good talent and both Juju and Ben have said he has what it takes to be a top WR which I believe judging from what I've seen.

"I do remember my high school self. I took an accounting class and pretty much hated every bit of the busy work that it was, but I still learned basic personal finance like how to balance a check book and what basic interest/taxes looks like. Incredibly basic knowledge but I still took it away from the class despite not enjoying a moment of course work. 

I also didn't enjoy doing laundry in high school but I found out quick at college that knowing how to do your own laundry was not commonly held knowledge.

It's important to instill even basic knowledge at a young age. People don't need to be experts in the field, they just need to know how things function. Repetition and exposure will happen as you age but the basics should be instilled at a young age to allow for that expansion of knowledge/understanding. 

Having access to a financial advisor doesn't mean you understand the right one to choose. [Listen to Shaq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMpZgt6agpU) talk about the vultures trying to get his money who are in the role of a financial advisor (starts at the 2:00 mark but the whole clip is worth watching as it directly addresses this topic). Thankfully, Shaq has a good deal of business savvy and had a good group of strangers around him (the bank manager he references and vets that talked to him about finance) to offer some sage advice that he listened to. 

Not every professional athlete has that savvy or group around them and that doesn't make them children. Being an adult isn't about constant cycles of sink or swim especially with hitting max earnings at such a young age - that is not even remotely a normal experience for the average adult. Thankfully, for Shaq, those that reached out with good advice didn't instead look on and say ""he's an adult, let him figure it out"".

"The Lions were in cap hell every year we had Calvin... That's just not true. Remember how Stafford actually had 2 of his best seasons in the two years after Calvin retired? Know why? Because we actually had receiver depth those years. Calvin may have carried the team to a few wins, but of we'd have had 3 or 4 average receivers instead of one elite one and mostly garbage, I would bet a ton of money they'd have won more games. 

Again, how often have the top tier WRs, in terms of salary, actually gotten their teams to anything meaningful?

"If Rodgers played in Marino's era, he would have been forced to retire years ago. No I am not the type of guy to say 'past players are tougher' but there is a solid argument to Marino being tougher than Rodgers. Rodgers gets hurt in the modern NFL, and he sits out for even the slightest of injuries. Marino played through injuries and still lit it up. Rodgers also plays in a pass heavy league with a better offensive line and talented receivers throughout his career. Marino had one or two receivers, who he honestly made look just as good as they made him look. Marino has how many QB records compared to Rodgers?  Dan Marino also stopped the Bears from having an undefeated season. He was the only QB in '85 to make that defense look weak. Marino's single greatest season is better than Rodgers. One thing Rodgers has is less interceptions and better accuracy, but this doesn't account for Rodgers having a better o-line, more receiving weapons, or the rules of defenses in Marino's era compared to Rodgers.


Rodgers is a great QB, and I am sure a lot of teams would love to have him, but he is not a better player than Marino.",nfl

""From the outside looking in, it’s easy to say that. But when you’re live in it, there’s just so much involved. Especially the communication factor. It’s not a simple Cover 3 at all.

"&gt; As for Goof, teams will copy the gameplan of the Lions / Bears / Patriots and make it harder for him to recognize the coverage after Mcvay can’t speak to him.

While that is what happened this last year I think that there will be some new things happening this year to prevent it. Things like McVay calling multiple plays and having presnap motions. Just giving him two or three plays to call. Ex: Line up for X play with O presnap motion. If defense shows something different, switch to Y play. It’s going to still rely on Goof to be able to recognize what’s going on and change it but I think McVay can work with him enough to get him that far. 

That said, I expect a very different year for the Rams this year. Goff had arguably the best OL in the league last year and still ate a ton of sacks. I think he has a very good arm but I think the game is really fast for him compared to Dak. When the game speed picks up Dak does better. He just makes better decisions and with the new offense and an offseason practicing his downfield accuracy with a new QB coach who harps on mechanics, I think we could see some significant growth. The Dallas OL looks to be much better and definitely deeper than last year and I think he could surprise a lot of people. He is pretty underrated especially here but this year will be a big test for both he and Goff.",nfl

Being a congressperson is a hard job. It's a job that requires specific skills. Diplomacy. Issues expertise. Procedural knowledge. And just the art of crafting bills and recognizing potential pitfalls in legislative language is something that requires years to truly master. It's a good thing to have people who are experienced with that, and who have built relationships on both sides of the isle.

More important, rotating out Congresspeople is just going to empower people who don't rotate. Lobbyists have no term limits. Congressional staffers don't. Political party leaders don't. Those are the people who take control when legislative seats become a revolving door. It's going to make legislators cheaper to buy as, barring a few terms they have to ride out, they can afford to please their sponsors more than their constituents. And it's going to speed up the pipeline of congressmen-&gt;professional lobbyists that's already a problem. Because if you know you'll have a corporate job waiting for you if you vote a certain way, and you know a term limit is going to force you out of office, what do you really have to lose?

There's a reason the Chiefs, Patriots, Seahawks, and Rams were last, 2nd to last, and tied for 3rd to last in run defense but still  won  a ton of games. The  Chiefs had one of the greatest pass rushes of all time and the other 3 had some combination of pass rush, coverage, and elite quarterbacks that all matter way more.",nfl
"Garbage analysis.  So you're saying that these roughing the passers were responsible for keeping so many drives alive. 
In the list of years you gave, the median rushing the passer calls is 99.5.  So essentially in 2018, there were 15 calls above this median.  These 15 additional calls were spread between 256 games.  Somehow this accounted for a vast inflation in QB numbers?

What?  Does this *really* make sense to you?",nfl

End of the game we straight felt that heel heat walking out of the stadium. So many people booing and jeering at us. It felt amazing.",nfl
How does one look up who the best slot corner is? Stats? Thats a bad way to judge DBs in general but its especially problematic here because you'd be comparing a guy who plays the slot exclusively vs a guy who plays outside in base 3-4 and then kicks inside in nickel and dime.,nfl

"The secondary has potential to be much better than last year with all the young corners that have been brought in. Despite losing Odell the receivers and skill players in general are still solid. The offensive line also was improved in the second half last year, which led to us playing much better football. We went 4-4 in the second half and lost a couple of nail biters. We're hoping that bringing in Kevin Zeitler and replacing Chad Wheeler at right tackle will give us better offensive line play from week 1, instead of having half the season with an awful line and the other have with a serviceable one like last season.    
    
I think we'll have a comparable record to last year, but that's the line of thinking. I think the ceiling could be around 6-7 wins which would be an improvement over 5-11.",nfl

"I'm reading over the press release now and kinda jotting down thoughts here, and this comes from someone who has a laptop, but not one that's great enough for gaming.

- I was honestly expecting much less developer support for this than other non-Nintendo/Microsoft/Sony game developers. A lot of times, big developers are hesitant to transition their software to unproven platforms, but this has support from a lot of top companies, which is pretty promising in and of itself.

- That said, promising ""the Netflix of gaming"" and then not having a steady catalog of games to rent seems weird. This seemed like a good opportunity to deliver a more on-demand Gamefly, but instead, it just kinda looks like another Steam marketplace. ""eventually"" including a backlog of games to stream doesn't justify the current $10/month pricetag, which is honestly very high for a service relying solely on third-party support.

- Cross-save support with Destiny 2 through the Xbox and PC versions is honestly super cool. Seems weird to have it be ""free-to-play as long as you're paying us $10/month for the service,"" though...

- The Stadia controller honestly looks pretty slick, even if it's a pretty standard controller. Pretty big fan of it being a Wi-Fi controller that connects to the Stadia servers over an individual device, as this flexibility should let them expand into other markets sooner.

- Kinda sad to hear that it's going to rely on 5G for wireless connection, as I have my own opinions on 5G as a service, but it would honestly be cool if their image pans out and you can stream PC-quality games to your phone with effort.

I see the potential with it, and $130 for a gaming system honestly isn't bad at all. But I think it's gonna have a bit of a rough launch, and while Google has the funding to overcome that obstacle that other random developer, it seems like an idea that could work...but is gonna need a bit of help.",nfl

Every team over .500 is likely to regress slightly, and every team under .500 is likely to improve slightly, that's just the nature of the NFL and the way the draft works.

It's not a massive insult to suggest Chicago will regress.",nfl

"Don't mean to be so direct, but it's asinine that you think that's a bad idea.  Teams that have highly paid studs like JJ Watt, Clowney, Hopkins, etc start to come up with cap shortages and can no longer effectively augment a good roster through FA and almost exclusively have to come up big in the draft.

Drafting two offensive linemen early gives you continuity with 2 young, promising individuals your team will have for the next 4 years on moderate rookie deals.  It also appears that they signed an older Matt Kalil as a 1 year stop gap, who could potentially be signed to an extension if it works out that way.

If anything, I'd say your team made at least a reasonable effort to add protection.  And I don't recall that many good OL candidates that didn't go for bat shit crazy numbers in the off season (Trent Brown, for instance).

As my fellow Colts dude point out, Colts just did that and are now considered to have one of the best OL in the NFL.  Granted, no one you drafted is Nelson, but you can see a significant improvement with those two rookie lineman if your FO knows what they're doing with talent evaluation.",nfl

I know you did. You (ranker group, not you specifically) also dismissed **A TON** of opinions out of hand, right from the very first post as being purely emotional. Some of you heavily implied, almost preemptively, that readers would overreact because they weren't as knowledgeable or were blinded by bias or weren't capable of understading the treatment of positional importance (even as many pointed out that there was no standard on positional importance). Like did you read Maad's initial post in the HM thread?  
  
&gt; The immediate reaction to this is probably ""Wtf, the QB who won the Superbowl and is one of the GOAT QBs all-time is off the list, which braindead fucks made this list"". Let's calm down and look at the season as a whole and in a vacuum.  
  
That's the first impression given. That's one of the first things people on the sub got to read in an actual rank release post. ""Calm down you overreactive simpletons, check out these stats I made.""   
  
There was plenty of bad mixed in with the reasonable coming from the rankers side, not just the non-ranker side. Most of you at least tried to absorb meaningful criticism.

"Hollins was supposed to eat up a lot of snaps last year according to the coaches, it wouldn’t shock me if he became a major rotational piece on the offense because of his size/speed/deep separation. Gibson has everything the coaches could want to keep him on the roster (he’s a good gunner, has flat out speed and tracked the deep ball well on his one long reception when Alshon was out) but he almost never sees the field when he’s been one of the healthiest receivers we’ve had since he was drafted.

He has 17 career TDs and 8 career INTs.  So that TD:INT is &gt; 2:1.

He's averaged 275 yards/game in his 10 starts, and 282 yards/game in his 8 starts as a 49er.  The 220 yards/game probably includes games where he came in only for a few snaps which is not the correct way to calculate it.

His career Y/A is 8.22.  Only Watson and Mahomes have higher Y/A with as many pass attempts as him.  And that's including all QBs since 1970.

"I disagree. Sayers was the original Terrell Davis except even better, great for a short period of time but great enough that it got him there. He was 1960s All-Decade and NFL 75th Anniversary Team at halfback. In his five healthiest years he led the league in rushing twice and was named to four Pro Bowls and five first-team All-Pro selections. The return numbers were icing on the cake, but his place as one of the greatest running backs ever would've been more than enough on its own.

Still, my point stands that a great returner needs more than that to be inducted to the Hall of Fame. Deion earned it with his play at corner, Sayers as a runner. Returns on their own don't seem to be enough.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: Adding in some additional support: Sayers was the only player named to the 75th Anniversary team at two positions, both halfback and kick returner. Mike Ditka has referred to him as the greatest player of all time. He was a living legend even way back when, and he's still the youngest inductee to the Hall of Fame ever, only 34 years old when he was inducted in 1977. If career totals are all a person looks at he won't stand out, but those five years before the knee injuries were among the most impressive of his era.",nfl

"Mosley is a great player, but he isn't a prototype LB for the modern game. He can handle zone coverage just fine when he successfully reads the play, but he doesn't have better than average speed and there are times where he can get abused by TEs one on one. 

Again, he's a great player, but if the NFL keeps getting more and more pass heavy then he's going to get progressively left further behind. The Jets overpaid by a large margin and I think we're going to be just fine without him. Investing heavy in the secondary is the better move, even if it means we have to rely on our young LBs stepping up moving forward. If Onwuasor can play as well as he did at the end of last season terrorizing Charger TEs then we'll be just fine and Kenny Young showed a lot last year to warrant some confidence.

Jalyen Holmes, Hercules Mata'afa, Jaleel Johnson, Armon Watts, and Shamar Stephen will all be battling for the #2 and #3 spot behind Linval. It might also make sense to bring back Tom Johnson, who is currently a FA but has been great for us as a situational pass rusher.",nfl

Alex Smith had a really good year last year.  Its dumb what KC has done just in my personal opinion.    People thought Manziel was gonna be great, Ryan leaf, Rick Mier, andre ware. You can not judge a qb on one game. You can't even judge a qb on one season.  Plenty of QBs have had a great season and never did anything else past that. Is Alex Smith great ? No.  But thats one thing I'm pretty confident in saying about mahomes.  He's not great.  At least he's not great In the next couple seasons I am sure of that.  Dak/Romo is a visual for me.

"Or you have a lot of people in similar situations to the one I was in:

Tried a traditional college but after a semester and a half i figured out it wasn't for me.  Took a few years of working various jobs to figure out what i really wanted to do with myself.  At the time I went my Job really wasn't flexible with the scheduling so that left evenings / weekends open.  There was really only a couple of for-profit ones that were available and I picked ITT Tech. 

Now with ITT unless you're a vet they can milk for your grants, you get setup with Sallie Mae loans.  All good you think? well you'd be wrong, so very very wrong.  I dont know how many kids got shafted by the loan officers like I did, but I have two large loans at 13% and 12.5%.  We're talking with balances of 30k each.  The other fun bit is that the majority of these loans though serviced by Sallie Mae were backed by private companies.  Hence why the interest rate is so high. It wasn't until after I turned 25 that i was able to get the Federally backed loans with the capped interest rates. By then i think only had a year left in school. 

Next you had a lot of people who went to one of those schools with the promise of starting a great career and that the school would help yo get placed.  I'm sure it happened somewhere, but it didn't happen at my school.  All of the folks I took classes with had jobs, or were getting jobs through connections of theirs with no assistance from the school.  And those of us that were employed were mostly employed in entry-level positions.  So now you have people racking up loans with the promise of help and all these prospects that never materialized.

In my situation i graduated right as the huge economic downturn happened.  I was lucky i was still employed, but i was barley making enough to pay for my car + Rent + expenses.  So I focused on those things to avoid being homeless and losing my job.  I would have loved to pay, but there literally was no money to give them.  What happens in that situation?  You start accruing more and more interest and fees (at least with Sallie Mae.) The real fun begins when you're in that magical sweet spot of not being able to afford to pay anything but also not being able to qualify for any sort of financial aid.  What happens in that case? Well after getting robocalled 15-20 times a day by their automated systems you can answer the phone and have a super demeaning discussion with one of their ""specialists"" where they basically tell you to borrow *MORE* money to make a payment this month. When you tell them how stupid that is you can almost hear the shrugging over the phone.  Many times when i'd stop to finally talk to one of them i'd end up getting angry and yelling at them.  I regret that since a lot of them were just trying to do their jobs, but I was in a super shitty situation.  What would end up happening is I'd get a form in the mail (then emails when they updated to take that form of communication) to apply for forbearance.  Not wanting my loans to hit default i felt forced into doing it.  They would take all of the interest that I had accrued, plus all of the late fees and added that to the balance of the loan.  My loans ballooned from owing roughly 80k at graduation to 145K some years later.  Shit fucking adds up so quickly.

Once the economy recovered and I lucked into some new jobs that actually paid quite a bit more, i was able to pay off my car and start putting that payment + a little more toward my loans.  However it was only enough to keep the interest + balance on my privately backed loans from ballooning, but not to actually start paying down anything.  So then i was only receiving about 6 - 7 phone calls a day about my by federally backed loans and i'd tell them that i was already paying and after going through my budget ask where i could spare more money to pay them.  They never had an answer. 

Sorry this was really long, but you wanted the mindset and here is one perspective on it.  Currently I'm doing fine now and through a lot of luck i'm in a really good spot now.  I pay 2500 - 3000 a month on my loans to get the balances down.  No person should have to pay that much for fucking loans.",nfl

Essentially, team 1 wins coin flip takes ball if they score a td team 2 has a shot at a two minute drill at least to tie and or win game. If team 1 comes up short they can punt and try to hold and maybe get a 3rd possession. Basically team 1 has advantage of more time and team two has advantage in knowing what they have to do to win.",nfl

I think they %100 carry five running backs to start the season. Especially since Watson will miss 4 games due to suspension and the team will be without Thomas/Gordon (at least for the first half of the year). Burkhead will see a lot of time motioning out of the backfield and playing receiver while Michel and Harris split running duties. And of course White serves as more of a third down/change of pace back. Mid way through the season though I wouldn't be surprised if they try to move him.,nfl

You think Lawrence Taylor is untouchable because everyone says it constantly around here and you here it over and over again. You saw them play, umh, congratulations, you're now not that much more qualified to speak on them than everyone else. You throw Watt back into the 1980's and the dude is destroying everyone. Technique, development, and athletic ability have skyrocketed over the past two decades. The average weight of a starting tackle in Lawrence's prime was around 260-270lbs. That 50lbs short of a elite tackle like Trent Williams or Tyron Smith, and that ignores all the training as well.

"An interesting idea with this concept too is that you don't have to exclude one specific position. Some offensive coordinators could use this to their advantage in some ways, albeit not as much of an advantage as the defense having an extra guy. 

The defense needing to identify assignments every play based on personnel could be interesting. And vice versa with offenses needing to seek out the man down pre snap.",nfl
"Having an excellent run game to start his career was absolutely beneficial to his development and eventual ascension too. It's not hard to look great when you only have to pass on 3rd down, and it certainly helped maintain his ability to be clutch. It is interesting to see how good Wilson is without that defense and run game though, he really did put a sub par team on his back and carried them further than they deserved to go. He was certainly hamstrung in the playoffs last year unfortunately by his own staff though. 

I don't take anything away from Brady though, and I'd choose him as my QB over Peyton Manning any day (personal preference, not looking to start an argument). We'll never know how Brady is without Belichick though, and that's not necessarily bad. They're the greatest QB-Coach duo of all time.",nfl

"Dobson was hyped for his catch rate, and that crazy catch he made in college, and he was gonna be the only receiver with height.

I am hoping that Gordon doesn’t play, unless he is able to be worked into the offense better last year where a lot of ball were forced to him and seemed to be done outside the offense.

Trey flowers is definitely going to be missed, but the money we used in his absence definitely helps fill that void and helps secure us against injury.


Again at this point of the year everyone has question marks, trying to fill holes.  But if these are our huge areas of need we have done an excellent job building a roster with players that look promising.  And I’m not sure you can slash for a better situation than that.  Except filling holes with vets, which is something we also did.

Things will probably change come training camp with injuries, and when we start seeing people play.  But as of right now I can’t think of a better situation than the SB winner only having 4 holes, with players coming back from injury in other areas strengthening those groups like CB and LB, and having players we have been waiting to take over in the areas that are considered holes.",nfl

"glad you asked this, actually. 

of 47 games, 11 with 98+ receiving yards &amp; 19 with 87+. In only 2 starts has he been held to under 38 yards, if that kind of consistency, regardless of the quality of receptions, doesn't impress you I'm not sure what will. 

For comparison, I see Mike Evans on the polar opposite end of greatness. Evans' catch rate is low, but that says nothing about him as a receiver, it says more about how he's been utilized &amp; expected to catch 50/50 balls.

However, if yards is the metric you desire for comparison here, Thomas not only caught 23% more in his 1st 37 games, he also averaged 3 more yards a game than Evans.

if you sort Evans lowest yardage games (which many also happen to be against Carolina &amp; New Orleans) some he was targeted 10 times &amp; made 1 reception. Targeted 3 times, 0 receptions. a lil silly to assume data says Thomas' stats are juiced from 'playing under' when the data also supports he produces every week. &amp; regardless of how he plays: no player hauls in 77% of their passes.

I would even argue Evans' is the one with juiced #s because those 100 yard games could have been big plays that ultimately meant nothing in a loss. That targeting him so much without a catch cost them drives. Again, none of that is on Evans... but I certainly think Thomas' is twice as efficient/consistent. IMO I guess.",nfl

You're telling me there's a 0% chance that if Gronk wasn't interfered with, he could have hit \#38 as he went to intercept the ball, causing it to pop up in the air and be caught by someone? Or rip the ball out of his hands as he fell to the ground?",nfl
"I don't think our jerseys have ever been very good, and we've never really taken a chance with them. But that also means we've never really had a terrible one.

"I think this sorta comes down to coaching. 

As the Cards, you could play insanely aggressive defense with an extra player. 10 All-Pros would still struggle to consistently move the ball while down a man.

"He had plenty of time to prepare. Bradford had the same amount of time with us and played extremely well in his first game. And it wasn't less than a week. Freeman had a couple weeks to prepare. 

He also didn't display any sort of competence with even a small nfl playbook because he wasn't even trying. Additionally, even when he knew the play and had a receiver just sitting down in a zone, he threw the ball over his head by 5 feet. Those should have been easy throws for an nfl qb to make regardless of time with the team. 

PLUS, he had 10-12 more weeks with the team and failed to show any sort of drive to even compete for the job in that time. 

AND take a look at his stats from the game against the giants and compare them to the stats from his first three games for Tampa that year. He was just as bad in those games. 

ADDITIONALLY, this first round qb who had put up very respectable seasons in 2010-2012 couldn't even make it to training camp with the giants in 2014. 

His performance in that game against the giants was absolutely his fault. The coaches shouldn't have played him, though, because they should have seen from practice that he wouldn't be able to play. Not because he didn't have enough time to prepare.",nfl

"I assume you didn't watch the Rams Lions game. Those 30 points were hugely reliant on the Lions giving up short fields thanks to the horrendous offense and iirc the defense tired near the end due to being on the pitch all game.

"The narrowing of the hashes actually enhances offensive play and makes it more difficult for a defense.  With the ball nearer to the center of the field the qb can deliver the ball faster and more accurately to the sideline on the wide side of the field, while also having more space to run routes into the short (or boundary) side.  There is a little less space to the wide side with narrow hashes but this slight shortcoming is more than made up for by the fact that the qb can more reliably get the ball to the wide sideline.  

Most college teams cannot consistently attack the wide sideline due to the distance from the qb launch point.  Defenses know this and so they do not heavily defend the wide sideline.  So, the wide hash actually has the effect of shrinking the amount of space the defense has to cover.  Defenses prefer to defend the ball on a hash as opposed to the middle of the field.",nfl
"No he isn't, he can scramble. There is a huge difference between an ability to scramble and an ability to run.

Rodgers ability to scramble is the best in the league but that is completely different than an ability to run with the purpose of gaining a first down instead of finding an open receiver.",nfl

His touchdown fades are nice but most of them come against teams like Kentucky who do not have talented corners. In fact most of his good plays come against weaker defenses. When he plays elite cbs he doesn’t flash and looks like an average deep threat. Also those injuries are major concerns.

I’m 31 and recently ended a long term relationship. I was broken.

I recently went to this cool restaurant/bar downtown with one of my buddies to have a good time. Anyone of any age can come in.

While we were there, there was a girl who was celebrating her 19th birthday (They sang happy birthday and they were allowed an outside cake with 19 on it).

The birthday girl was pretty so I wanted to go chat her up. Her friends were super cute too. My buddy told me to leave them alone and that they looked like “babies”. He didn’t want to go over at first, but since the breakup, every other woman but my ex has been invisible. So he went to wingman with me.

We walked over and wished her a happy birthday. I thought things were going well and the women were laughing. Then all of a sudden one of the girls snaps at me to “take a fucking hint R Kelly”. I was taken aback and just said “excuse me”. She said to read the room and that they were uncomfortable. Another asked to us to go away. I was going to go but I was really bothered by the r kelly comment.

I said it’s fucked up to call me a predator when we are all adults here. My buddy wanted to leave, but I stood my ground.

The birthday woman said that it didn’t matter, it’s weird for someone my age to hit on them, especially when they make it obvious that they are uncomfortable. Then made another r Kelly comment by asking if she she looked like Aliyah to me. Which upset me again.

I apologized for making them uncomfortable but that didn’t give them the right to call me a predator.

One of the women said jt was a “personal problem”. I said that adults are allowed to hit on the adults. It’s not a crime. One woman just asked why I was still standing there and yelled at me to go away.

I was pissed off and when I left, their entire table was singing “remix to ignition” and laughing their asses off. I was furious and humiliated.

When we sat back down, I was seething. My buddy said that it was my fault for not seeing the signs that they were uncomfortable. To him it was obvious, so he wanted to go. He called me “delusional”. I pointed out that they were laughing and he said it was just uncomfortable laughter.

I told him that I had every right to be mad about being called a predator when they were all 18-19. It’s a horrible accusation.to make. My ex was 6 years older than me. He said that they weren’t calling me a predator, just weird for going for teens. He said it was wrong of them to sing after me and that was bullying. But I should have left long before that. I felt like he should have stuck up for me.

Why the FUCK do Digiornos value packs come in 3s? Such an awkward fucking number. Like, if it's 2, that's an understandable amount of pizza. If it's 4, good for parties, or even 2 now 2 later. But 3? That's just kind of a fucking no man's land, you think? What, are there gonna be 3 different times in a week you're gonna cook up and eat a Digiornos pizza? And if I want to buy more, I'd have to buy SIX pizzas. Kind of overkill imo. Doesn't this all seem a little dumb? Like, a whole ass company thought it over and was like ""Let's package these babies up in threes and not fours or twos, that will SURELY make us the most money"". Fuck you Digiornos. You're lucky your pizza is good. Totino's does it right. Totino's is the golden standard for frozen pizza. Party 4 pack for FIVE DOLLARS? That's good shit right there. Why can't you be like Totino's, Digiornos? Makes me heated. Fuck you Digiornos.",nfl
"Off of what could you even have him as a contender for #1 all time? I understand that it was a different game back then, so it isn’t really fair to compare yards, touchdowns, etc. But you can compare completion percentage. His career completion percentage is 55.8%, which puts him at... 116th place all time. His best single season percentage is 64.7%, which is tied at the 152nd best all time. I’d have at least Brady, Peyton Manning, Favre, Rodgers, Brees, Montana, Elway, Marino, Young, and Staubach ahead of him.",nfl
"We drafted Kamara, he was a good runner, we start having a more balanced offense. 3 years ago Brees passed for +5k and we still were only 7-9 (of course defense also improved). His AY/A in the last 3 years were 7.8 8.3 and 9.0, he's throwing it less but he's still great at it.",nfl

Also, the owners don't want to pay for other teams.

And NFL owners don't benefit from other teams stadiums. They share TV revenue equally, but then everything you can make outside of that, you keep. This is why teams are so focused on stadiums, they want high ticket prices, super expensive luxury suites, etc. That's money they get to keep to themselves.

"True, but the injury from the Bears didn't look like a late hit.  Against the Bears he got sacked, which is a thing that *happens* to a QB, and it went bad for his knee.  It also wasn't clear how bad it was until much later, because Rodgers was able to play through it.

The Lions injury happened in a late game that had no implications for either team.

"Fair enough, I misread you’re point as more of a knock on the scheme than the players. 

I would argue that having a ~15 offense is more than enough when paired with a consistent top 5 defense (if they can achieve that). No, they don’t have the weapons GB does but Stafford, Golladay, and Kerryon are a solid core that can easily show out and attract better FAs next year.",nfl
"&gt; I don't understand why you wouldn't include his rookie years. They're actually happening

Because. They. Were. Happening. Either. Way. He was already getting paid that money. He was already on contract for those seasons. The cap hit is completely 100% entirely unchanged. He is literally on the same deal for two more seasons. The only thing that has changed is the four-year extension immediately following his rookie deal. The question we are asking is weather or not those four years are a good value. Not weather or not his old rookie salary was a good value. Because, ahem* WE ALREADY KNOW HIS GUARANTEED ROOKIE DEAL WAS A GOOD VALUE. Most rookie deals are. That however says nothing about his value once the rookie money ends, and the extension money takes over. Averaging the two together does not make any sense whatsoever if you’re trying to quantify the value of his four-year extension. If you don’t understand that by now then I’m not sure I can explain it to you.

&gt; That doesn't make it ""definitely the biggest guaranteed salary,"" 

Okay, just FYI, Carson Wentz’s new contract literally set the record for largest guaranteed salary in NFL history. So it’s definitely the biggest guaranteed salary.",nfl

"Right. The other problem is that many of them are so close in skill that small variables can make a large difference (strength of WR core, strength of opposing secondary, playcallers, even shit like how many games they played indoors, primetime, cold, etc) that all add up to have enough impact to blur the the ranks more. One reasonable list could have a QB at 24 and another reasonable list could have that same QB at 14 and it would be the same selective bias crap I'm talking about. Other positions are far easier to rank but QB has too many variables. Cant do it effectively.",nfl
"Maybe. Admittedly, I was in the 3rd round pick camp until I watched the tape and poked around a bit more.

"Honestly the Lions are better than their record was last year, but they were a very thin team that absolutely could not afford to sustain the injuries that they did. 

I still think they may underperform again in 2019, but more so because their division is an absolute slap in the dick to get through rather than Detroit just outright being a lesser team. 7-9 or 8-8 is what I expect, unless Kerryon seriously blows the fuck up and becomes the weapon I think he can be...then they might steal a couple extra games and make a playoff push.",nfl

It wasn't that they didn't want the Patriots to build it, it's that they literally did not want one within the town limits. At all.

The NFLPA is in a tough position, because they have so many players and only a little leverage. The owners are billionaires who can wait them out if a work stoppage comes to pass, and the only way for the players to get the owners to crack is to be unified. But there's just too many players to reasonably expect that, so they basically do what they can against an ownership group that is wealthy and business savvy. It's a very tough position to be in.

I covered marijuana a few answers earlier, but I do think the salary cap will only continue to go up. The question is whether the players can push for a larger percentage of the league's annual revenue (they currently get 47 percent). I'm not sure they'll be able to, but I'd definitely try.",nfl

"As it is now teams are obligated to spend to a salary floor that’s 95% of the cap for the league as a whole, guaranteeing the contracts is pointless to the players as a WHOLE, yes a specific player might get screwed by injury but no one acknowledges how it will help another player. The system works very well in that it forces players to actually try which is just great for the fans. As it is now big contracts are guaranteed for a majority of it anyway cause of the way deadcap works.

If I was the players I’d look to change one specific thing in regards to getting cut and that’s the timing of it. It’s completely unfair to get cut right now if you don’t have a guaranteed contract, teams have already spent their cap and you won’t be able to negotiate the way you would’ve at the start of FA, you shouldn’t be fucked because some stud fell in the draft or someone else came along. I’d negotiate to have only a few week window before free agency, if you get cut now you should still get paid.",nfl
"Because everyone knows to determine a good running back you strictly look at third/fourth and short conversions and 20+ yard runs. Fuck the “whole body of work crap” I’d rather have a running back converts two first downs for me and gets a 20 yard run, way sicker! You also gave no context on how many opportunities each got on 3rd/4th and short so a conversion rate would be nice, but I understand that might not make Conner look as good so you wouldn’t want to include *too many* stats in your argument.

"And to add to that for u/PolarDepress, the Eagles have a fully healthy Wentz. I won't pretend to know if he'll be healthy throughout the season, but I know he's fully healthy for the first time since 2017. We all remember what a healthy Wentz looked. 

On top of that, we added not 1 but 2 RBs who are infinitely better than anyone we had last season. We added a deep threat (one of the best in the league) in Jackson, which we didn't have last year. We also added the best contested/jump ball WR in college to our offense, who should be a tremendous asset in the redzone. 

On defense, we added an IDL in Malik Jackson while converting Tim Jernigan from starter to rotation player. We're getting back Barnett who was lost for the season early in the year. We brought back Vinny Curry. We added Zack Brown to our starting LB group. We're getting Rodney McLeod back, who was lost after week 3 and our young guys (Maddox and Douglas) got a ton of great experience last post-season. 

To think the Eagles or Dallas is coming out with basically the same team from last season, isn't just middle school level reasoning, it's objectively false. Big changes to both teams is why a lot of analysts around the NFL have both the Eagles and the Cowboys as 2 of the top teams in the NFL, let alone the NFC.",nfl

This is true, but misleading. If you move the years around in any direction, then Strahan was better. Rice just happened to get really good a year after Strahan was already elite, and Rice got injured in '06 while Strahan got injured in '04. Counting Strahan's 4 postseason games to make up for his 8 games missed in '04 also makes this not true, which speaks to how close the margins are.",nfl
I think around 50 would have been a good spot as well. He's finished as a top 5 guard on this list so at least positionally he's ranked pretty well. He earned his AP honors; just a lot of quality guards. I think the fact you have to weigh RGs as well factored in more than him being a rookie.,nfl

If you want to bring up revenue, the USWNT has been rising in that aspect, and even brought in more money than the USMNT in 2015.

He's been used in the slot as the Larry Fitzgerald style slot and has actually been pretty successful when asked to do it, Koetter just didn't exploit it as much as Peyton would have, partially because Tampa had a prototypical slot in Adam Humphries.",nfl
"I'm not particularly familiar with your two examples, my point is if you draft a player in the first round who has legitimate injury concerns, and then those same injuries prevent them from playing to the expected level by large degrees, they can be called a bust. If they had no prior injury concerns, or they were a later round pick with lower expectations, then I don't think they can be considered a bust.

Of course, I'd also argue a rookie can be a ""break-out"" player which seems to be going against the general sentiment here. I think it's an overused term (what isn't overused at this point?), but if a rookie crushes expectations then they can be called a break-out player. If a UDFA ends up being an all-pro starter by the end of the season, I find it hard to imagine people would argue he's not a ""Break-out player"".",nfl
"&gt; My actual point was that all of that work and money was a complete waste because people hated almost every second of the finished work product.

Except for when you concede that you didn't hate every second of it:

&gt; All of that enormous amount of work that was put in **did turn out something that was pretty cinematically stunning.** 

So yeah, your point is not valid about it being a ""complete waste"". The work they put into it did its job because the cinematography is excellent for most of the season, including the last episode. You can't base your opinion of the photography of the show on the writing. That doesn't make any sense.

You can't say it was a ""waste"" if you concede that it's done well. That's not what ""waste"" means. If they spent all that money, time, and hired all those people for the cinematography to turn out poorly, then you can call that a ""waste"". But that's not what happened, was it?

&gt; Most great shows are written by committee. There's a strong direction from the showrunners and head writers

You contradicted yourself here, buddy. If there's strong direction from 1 or 2 people, who have final say over the finished product (and yes, D&amp;D had final say over the finished product, not every writer that contributed), then it is not, in fact, written by committee. They do not have equal say. All the focus group-tier rewriting that's been vomited into existence by ""fans"" just further proves people have no idea what they're talking about when it comes to writing an award-winning drama. You cannot honestly say the real ending is worse than one where everyone lives happily ever after, where Danny never goes crazy and shows mercy, or the ones where the Queenslayer becomes King and everyone's just cool with it.",nfl

"&gt; Well that's not at all surprising to me. Unfortunately, we'll remain at an impasse because I will not be stepping away under any circumstances.

If you're doing your own thing, without special privileges granted by the mods, that's perfectly fine. God bless and have fun.

If you're continuing to run official r/nfl rankings that get stickied week after week despite the sub being unhappy with this year's rankings and with your leadership of them, that would be pretty bullshit and would reflect incredibly poorly on the mods--and frankly if you don't offer to step aside *and* seek that same special treatment after a fiercely controversial year where your rankings have been intensely unpopular, then it reflects poorly on you, too.

&gt;As far as the sticky, as I've noted I'm not a mod, and don't have a say in the matter.

Absolutely disingenuous. As I've pointed out repeatedly and as I've noted in the past, if the rankers asked the mods to stop stickying these threads it's extremely likely they'd stop doing so. And if they refused, the rankers could refuse to keep posting further installments until the mods acquiesced.

You aren't actively responsible for the stickying decision, sure. But if you're in charge of the rankings project as a whole you absolutely have veto power over it. Don't hide behind evasions and pretend otherwise.

&gt;It's a sub series. 

If it really is in a meaningful sense, then the sub should sure as hell be able to exercise some veto power over who runs this all next year. I'd wager that given the chance, the sub wouldn't choose you.

Again though: if you want to do your own rankings without stickied threads or some official NFL aura, you should absolutely feel free to do that in whatever way you want.",nfl

"&gt;I would say a running back who has over 1500 receiving yards and 9 TDs through the air in two years for almost 10 yards a catch is a pretty significant contributor to the offense

It's all about opportunity cost and marginal differences.

Only if you have a definition of ""number 2"" that looks at his stat totals vs others.

Your Non-Thomas WRs had 9 more targets for 400 yards than  Kamara, with 7 more TDs.

Literally everyother position. it is only when you get to QB that they become “flawed media awards”.


Any discussion that begins and ends with “more APs” is hilariously superficial, and the fact that you WANT Brady v Peyton to be reduced to that is pretty pathetic.

To your checklist: I would love to hear your explanation for how it's so much easier, and yet, yards per completion DECREASED. I know you won't understand this, but I'll explain with actual statistics, something you've yet to do at all. 

From 2008 to 2018, yards per attempt increased 0.4 yards while yards per completion decreased 0.1 yards. What does that tell you? That means that 2018 QBs are opting more for short, high-percentage throws than the long bomb. It's the only explanation for completion percentage increasing while yards per completion decreases. There is no other explanation. So, if QBs are choosing to throw short more often than 10 years ago, what does that tell you about the passing atmosphere? It certainly can't be significantly easier, otherwise QBs would be airing it out more and we'd see an increase in yards per completion. It can only be comparable in ease to 2008 or more difficult. The stats lean more to the former as most efficiency stats are comparable and even quantity stats are in the same realm when scaled for the 8% uptick in PAs.

"you want a guy who can do something after the catch? he's not top 25

you want a guy who can just go get you 12yds? he's top 5

the pressure is on the QB when throwing to mike though, where you hit him is about where he's going down and if that's 12yds deep on 3rd and 13, he may not be the best option. he's reliable as far as where he's going to be, he's gonna give you max effort until he makes the catch but he doesn't like to be hit, he wont' fight for extra yardage and he isn't going to break tackles (he averages just over 1 broken tackle per season....no that isn't a typo)

i'd say overall he's in the 10-15 range but he's got a pretty specific role and hasn't shown he can be anything more. he can't do what elite guys do after the catch and he's not the best possession guy out there, but he is one of the best at that.

i think he gets to be who he is this year in arians' offense and godwin will take on the role of ""elite swiss army knife"" on the other side, someone who can stretch the field, get YAC, turn nothing into something, etc and mike can be the guy that requires safety attention to soften up coverage elsewhere, kinda like the cris carter/randy moss relationship.

"&gt;There are a few other guys I feel the same way about (RGIII, Leinart, etc.)

While I'd agree in general that there are some guys who really never stood a chance based on who drafted them, I dunno about those two examples.  Leinart definitely got thrown out there a bit too early as a rookie but still wound up in a pretty good situation all-in-all.  He was drafted by a team that had prime Anquan Boldin, young Larry Fitzgerald, and Edge in his final productive seasons *and* was afforded an Aaron Rodgers-esque opportunity to learn for a few years behind an all-time great.  You can say what you will about Whisenhunt as a head coach but the dude's got a pretty decent resume on the offensive side of the ball.

RGIII is... a weird case.  He landed in one of the *best* QB development systems you could possibly have set up for a rookie, especially one as raw as Griffin was as a pocket QB.  That offensive staff had a two-time Super Bowl winning head coach with *three* future head coaches working beneath him, a strong commitment to running the ball effectively, and a damn good idea of how they could use their QB's skillset from day one and bring him along over time while still winning games.  On paper, that mix of credentials absolutely should have worked... until you factor in the powderkeg of very different, very strong personalities from ownership to coaching staff to player and the potential to blow everything the fuck up by adding, for example, a major injury to the equation.

I can't imagine a situation that works out much better for Griffin, either.  I feel like a lot of coaches out there wouldn't have been so successful at using him from day one and there really aren't that many true QB gurus out there for his long-term development.  I also feel like a Bill Belichick or Tom Coughlin type hardass would have kicked him to the curb early because, honestly, RGIII is kind of an annoying dude (he's /r/getmotivated personified... his self-confidence was as loud as it was artificial) and came into the league with *major* focus problems.  MAYBE if you give him to Andy Reid it works out but Andy is probably the only guy in the league that is both player-friendly enough to deal with RGIII the personality and qualified enough to turn that raw athletic talent into something (the Redskins only really had the latter half of that covered).  In hindsight, I really think he was just doomed.

"So, one of the more interesting stories about this game was that Mangini had set up hand signals and code words for the offense that changed their meaning after halftime, because as a former Pats insider, he knew what they were looking for to make adjustments.

So when the Pats made their halftime adjustments to what the signals were, the signals then had new meaning which put the defense out of position, which allowed the Browns to get a few good plays off before Belichick and his crew figured out what we did.

The previous game was against the defending champion Saints where we ran trick plays, a lot of wildcat looks, and stuff we hadn't done before, and just blew them out of the water.  Plus Rob Ryan had our defense on fire these two weeks.  These two games made the best coached games the Browns had in the entire 00's decade, but Mangini couldn't keep it going, and aside from those two games, we were still awful.",nfl

"I'll provide the gist of it here. I'm buried in all of these sub-threads so whatever, if I get my inbox more blown up so be it. I won't copy paste the whole thing because it's long.

I did not think Tom Brady deserved a spot on the list for three primary reasons: statistically speaking he was below average in many statistics that I value when compared to the nominated QBs (which I don't think I can share here), his tape had some glaring missteps that I haven't seen from him before, and I did not take playoff success into consideration.

I started by removing the nominated QBs who had no chance of making the list, which narrowed it to a number of QBs in the low teens. I looked at various efficiency stats including: TD%, INT%, y/a, rating under pressure, adjusted accuracy, and team points per drive. When averaging out these numbers across the QBs who I thought were real possibilities, Brady did not come in ""above average"" (reminder, relative to the nominated QBs, he had a good season and I will never say otherwise) in every category. Only 2 QBs who made this preliminary cut had worse TD%, he was below average (though relatively closer to the middle of the pack) in INT%. Only 2 QBs had a lower y/a (Brady's was 7.6, average was 8.03). Rating under pressure was below average with brady scoring a 71.2 compared to the average 74.01. Finally, his adjusted completion was also below average. Not by a ton, but it was.

Second, the tape. I don't claim to have watched all of his tape. I did not have the time to watch every snap for every player because I work and have a life outside of work + this activity. I saw plenty of good, which a patriots fan (o_thescientist maybe?) provided elsewhere in this thread. It was a good read and would have been a stellar other side of the opinion. But I found examples of things I didn't love in his tape alongside the good. 

First: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIoKr1f4e8M&amp;feature=youtu.be I have never seen brady, in the 4th quarter of a game late in the season where there was still competition for seeding throw this bad of an interception. He moves around the pocket and avoids pressure as much as he can which I give credit for, but he throws an ill-advised pass off of his back foot which sails not out of bounds. It was 2nd down and he could have thrown the ball away but he sails the ball. 

https://streamable.com/bpg6o - Not a ton to say about this one. It's a miscommunication, but still, in my opinion, out of character for him.

There were various examples of miscommunication/sailing balls that I thought Brady previously didn't miss. https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ReasonableEarnestKingsnake-mobile.mp4 coverage is good there, but brady gave no chance for the receiver to make a play.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRY1Z23eiKg&amp;feature=player_embedded just an ill advised throw. 

Finally, on his 500th TD he held on to the ball far too long and heaved a ball to Josh Gordon who made a stellar play on the ball. It was not a great throw, in my opinion. 

Finally, I did not include playoffs for one primary reason. I wanted everybody I looked at to be on an equal playing field in terms of statistics. A great playoffs and winning did not factor into my rankings because 1) not all teams had the opportunity to do that and 2) Brady had good moments in the playoffs. He had bad moments in the playoffs. Belichick and that whole team rallied so giving him credit for winning the SB did not seem right to me.

Finally, I will copy and paste my final paragraph. My argument was not telling people not to rank him. The title is ""A case against Tom Brady making the top 100"". It was not ""Don't rank Tom Brady"".

Final paragraph: Again, this is all my opinion. But I've thought about it, I've watched tape, and he was not as sharp as 7-8 other QBs this season which, for me, lets him fall outside of my top 100. Another disclaimer, I am in no way saying he had a bad season. I am saying he had a below-average season compared to the other strongest QBs in the league last season. This list should be about the best of the best at each position during the 2018 season. In my opinion Brady was not the best of the best at his position in 2018.

I preface everything by stating it is my opinion after my personal research. I hope this helps and if you need someone to vouch that this information is correct I can do so. I do not want to break any rules set by MTC

Edit: I have no issue with people disagreeing with me. This is a relatively hot take in today's nfl and I accept that. I also knew this would ruffle feathers, but I didn't do it because I hoped it would ruffle feathers. You're more than welcome to post this comment wherever you like, doesn't matter to me. But I also didn't just make stuff up and spew nonsense in some conspiracy to leave him off of the list.",nfl

"No it’s just arbitrary. There are busts and draft steals just like any other era. The 49ers probably had excellent scouting at that time or excellent player development.

"I mean if teams are reportedly offering him $11 million but didn't want to trade for him at $13 million in March or April, it's really splitting hairs.

"In all honesty it could catch up to them starting next year.

They used 4 picks on Trubisky in 2017. They used 2 more picks on Miller in 2018 and 2 more on Mack. They then traded up and used 4 more picks on Montgomery / Ridley.

They are flirting with being dangerously thin in depth. If they get a few injuries I think there drop off is going to be absolutely enormous.

And then obviously when it comes time for contracts it's going to be really hard to keep all these guys since they'll be so thin on rookies.",nfl
He was 4th in drop percentage in the entire league in his 3 full seasons in Oakland. It was bad. That is amongst all WRs. His tenure in Oakland was marred by inconsistency. He seems to have turned it around but again you can’t just pretend he didn’t drop the ball a lot,nfl
"We drafted 3 DBs in a row and I don't necessarily dislike any of them in particular, but I'm afraid our focus on DBs is going to blow up in our face in the trenches. One of them had better be a huge home run or all of them at least fairly good to justify that expenditure, but I have my doubts. Plus, DBs can only do so much if you're not winning the battles in the trenches and limiting the amount of time the QB has to throw. Hopefully new coaching staff can fix it, but I'd argue that there aren't a whole lot of DBs in the NFL that could have done much to fix the problem with the amount of time we were giving QBs to throw.",nfl
We don't blame the Rams and have not bridged their subs. I don't get what point you are trying to make. A non-saints fan posts and article about an event that happened right after the NFC Championship game that that hasn't even been posted in our sub and a Vikings fan shows up and says stop whining (which again no one was doing) and in the same breath mentions events that happened 10 years ago. I found that ironic since the OP comment mentioned stop being hypocritical. Your excuse for constant harrassment (which bridging essentially is) for over a decade is the bounty thing justifies that? Sure be mad at Greg Williams or anyone else involved (not going to argue the points of that scandal here) but showing up to totally unrelated threads and subs and throwing that stuff in our face 10 years later is pretty petty for no reason.,nfl

"The kid is fun to watch. However, it felt a lot like watching a recreation of Cam Newton's read-option season which went amazing until teams figured it out.

That being said I feel like he is going to develop into a much better quarterback than he currently is and we'll be fine. But yeah year 2 could be a very difficult year for him.",nfl
"I guess it more depends on Chad’s desire to win too, he was an outstanding QB but if he was looking to get paid like most QBs in the NFL are then the better team probably still would’ve been built around the Pats.

But a car is something that you physically look at, use, and control everyday.  You put you’re life at risk with it.  You put other people’s life at risk.  It is a piece of machine that has a lot of engineering put into it.  There is comfort, feel, how the car handles, etc.  it’s an experience.  It’s why people test drive cars before they buy them.  

Most people can relate to wanting to buy a nice expensive car if they could.  And when you have that kind of money, Reddit would probably also look the other way if he decided to buy Monster Cables.",nfl

Dallas went 3 wide when they didn't really have a WR1 or WR2, their offense was a collection of WR3s. That drew a nickle corner out, then  they would run at the side of the nickle back and Zeke would be more likely to break the tackle or just plain run through the little men.",nfl

"Scouts Inc gave Jones a grade of 76. The only other player since their data is available back to 2004 with a grade that low, to be drafted in the first round, is EJ Manuel (also 76). Tebow was a 78. Ponder was their 3rd lowest graded first rounder ever, and he was an 85. 

NFL.com gives him a ""chance to become NFL starter"" grade, 4th best in the class and 9th in the last 2 years. 

QBASE projects him as the 5th best QB in the class, behind Lock and Finley. Football Outsiders' other metric, measuring Functional Mobility, has him at 6th with Grier above him as well.

So okay, maybe mock drafts knew that there was interest, and maybe that's because writers were aware of Gettleman's interest, or maybe not. But as a prospect, he fits squarely in the middle of the pack in a subpar QB class, and #6 was always going to be a reach. 

Point taken about needing a trade partner; this is why we ""reached"" with Ward at 4 last year. But even if they passed on him for a Josh Allen and somehow missed out on him at 17, you move on and pick one next year or pick another guy. He's not the type of prospect you need to spend that kind of capital on, no matter how much you believe in him, especially if you don't plan to play him right away. They just picked a bad year to pick a QB with that high a pick.",nfl
"You can omit Evans and Kelce. Evans is a premier deep threat and thus will always put up fewer receptions than can be expected of an elite receiver, and Kelce is a tight end. It'd be weird if Tate didn't have more catches than the two of them.

"Rings isn't the only metric that matters for QBs. Dilfer has a fucking ring and Marino doesn't. Is Dilfer better than him? 

Foles had his best season ever under Kelly and then came back down to earth the next season. Until Foles stops looking like dogshit every other game or two he isn't an actual franchise guy. In 2017 when he won a Super Bowl he finished the year playing in 7 regular season games with a 56% completion rating and attempting a whole 14.4 passes per game. That is absolutely not starter quality material and him winning a ring that year with a great post season performance is the definition of outlier. Foles is only getting 22M per year cause that is fairly cheap now for a QB and the Jags are desperate grasping at straws hoping something works before the rest of the team ages. In all likelihood Foles will  be the backup on another team after the next two seasons.",nfl

People often misuse the word *ambivalent* to describe something they're neutral about or uncaring one way or the other.

"An analytical solution means you can write an equation and plug in numbers to get your answers for a set of conditions. So for example, you can find the flight distance as a function of launch velocity and launch angle. The equation may be messy, but you just need the patience to put the numbers in and you can see what you get.

On the other hand, a numerical solution involves using some initial numbers to find another number, which you use to find the next number, which you use to find the next number... until you get the one you want. To find the throw distance this way, you might start with a launch velocity of 65 mph and launch angle of 44 degrees. Then you use the drag equation to find the acceleration of the ball. You use that acceleration and combine it with gravity to modify the velocity of the ball over 0.01 seconds. Use this velocity to update the ball's displacement. Then you repeat the process at a time of 0.02 seconds, 0.03 seconds, 0.04 seconds ... and 2.95 seconds when the ball hits the ground. Now the computer finally spits out the final distance. This method requires more computer power, but it can analyze more complex situations. The problem is that you have to do the entire process for every single initial condition you want to test. 

With an analytical solution, you can graph it or use calculus to optimize or whatever to infer what the trends should be. With a numerical solution, you just have to keep crunching numbers and see what you get. It can be much harder to tell what will happen if, say, you decrease the launch angle by 2 degrees. This problem isn't too complex, but for  computational fluid dynamics and the like, tiny changes in the initial conditions can cause huge differences in the final result. So numerical solutions need to be sanity checked extensively before accepting their accuracy.",nfl
"I’m pretty sure Suh has  another year or more of money coming from the dolphins on top of his other contracts because of that nutty deal he got over like 8 years. Everyone wants that guaranteed money tho.

"Alright, I’m going to dissect this. First off, I answered your first point. It was a different era where good players weren’t given the option to leave their team. There wasn’t turnover. It’s the reason why there are so many HoFers on the winning teams in the first couple decades of the Super Bowl era.

Now that I know you don’t have an opinion I understand you thought you stumbled on something after looking up some stats and putting up very little thought.

Your math example makes no sense. If we’re working on a hard math problem and you forget to carry the one you don’t debate if someone knows the answer you start over because everything past the mistake is incorrect. I’m telling right now that there is a correct answer and there’s a reason why he’s given the title of the best running back of all time.

Lastly, as for the post season, it’s not like today’s post season. Back then the post season on consisted of the championship game or possibly a tiebreaker game to put you in the championship game.

"I don't think he was ever truly committed to the job.

By the time he made it to Miami he'd been a coach for 30 years and it's clear that his heart was still in Dallas. 

He also had an incredible amount of luck in Dallas, as is always needed. Just like Belichick happened to fall upon Tom Brady in the sixth round. Johnson found the sucker for his Walker trade and got a great leader in Troy Aikman, a generational runningback in Emmitt Smith, and an all-time talent at wide receiver in Michael Irvin. You can't just recreate that incredible draft haul on a new team. What happened with the Cowboys was just fate.",nfl
"One Super Bowl Championship, one Super Bowl MVP

Greatest TD:INT ratio in NFL history among qualifying quarterbacks (seriously, he's been a starter for 11 years and has only thrown 80 interceptions)

2 NFL MVP awards

2 First Team All Pros (which is more than Philip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Drew Brees, and Eli Manning have combined)

1 Second Team All Pro

So here's my qualifiers for a Hall of Fame player. Not all are required, but you can look at them and see that if they're in the Hall of Fame, they had these:

-Good for a decade: Aaron Rodgers has been excellent for over ten years. His season high interceptions is 13. He's thrown over 35 TDs in a season four times.

-He's won at least one regular-season league-wide award: MVP x2

-He's been named to multiple All-Pro teams. That means that he was recognized as the best at his position over multiple seasons.

Edit: I think Favre gains the most with his win. Others like Flacco lose the most, and guys the stature of Rodgers or Brees or LT or someone wouldn’t lose that much, like Marino. It just didn’t go his way but he’s up there in the top tier no matter what.",nfl

It averaged 3.3 yards per carry off of 28 carries. The offenses drives were FG-punt-punt-punt-FG-INT-FG-punt-FG-punt-fumble-punt-punt-TD-punt with their lone TD coming on a drive where they got the ball at the Panther 4 yard line and one of the FGs coming on a drive that netted -1 yards (set up by a 61 yard punt return).

"Know he’s on the Browns but agreed the levels of shit he got comparatively are basically nothing compared to what y’all got.

I think the other thing is optics though. When the Browns signed him it was in the middle of nothing season for them and other shit going on. Sure they got shit for it, but it was the middle of the playoffs and people will talk about those teams more than him. Would be shocked if his past isn’t brought up come close to when he returns though. When he as with the Chiefs, he was a high profile back among the top in the league at the time, on a playoff darling, and a feature player with the league MVP. It doesn’t take a lot of thought as to why he caught so much flack over it when it emerged and when it was during his time with the Chiefs as compared to when the Browns signed him. Doesn’t help that he lied about it to the Chiefs as compared to it being known to the Browns (not that it softens anything he did by far), which people forget the lying played a role in his situation with the Chiefs too.

That said, I get the “changed man” point and guess I agree to disagree. There’s been legit like 1 article about it and half of that only came forth from associates timing due to what he’s done being brought up on local Cleveland radio. No Browns fans are talking about how he’s completely changed, and most including myself probably talked about how at least it’s known he’s trying to do something, rather than just constant ridicule on a dude who may be taking strides to be better and help others. I get that’s an unpopular thing to say, but I’d rather a dude who did a shitty thing do good, change, and it be noticed a bit; rather than a dude doing a shitty thing, continue to do shitty things, not change, and be defended and have people justify his ability to stay around shit.",nfl

The jury is still out for Bill O'Brien for me, but I'm okay with seeing out his contract unless things fall apart before then.

Also kind of a side note: 

One could argue Stafford is good enough to get it done, but because they haven't had a decent coach and running game (among other issues) they haven't been able to find success. Something similar could be said for Rivers, aka Millennial Marino, but I don't know what their problem is bc it's now not coaching or the running game.",nfl
"Aaron is 6'1"" and yet crazy strong and plays almost exclusively on the interior. He's relatively short for a lineman so the combination means he knocks lineman off of their blocks pretty easily unless they're ready to be driven back and demands a double team. 

JJ is long as hell and has a really high motor. He seems to go 100 % as long as he's in the game so while he's really strong I feel like he tires  linemen out more often than not hence why he moves up and down the line often though he does play interior more often than not. 

Khalil Mack I believe is the most versatile of the DL of his type. He moves around like JJ but plays back to play the run and short pass much more often than them. But when he does rush, my god, watch out.",nfl

"As a Canadian, I think it comes down to stadium capacity. I'm in Vancouver and BC Place (that hosts the BC Lions (CFL) and Vancouver Whitecaps (MLS)) has capacity of 54,000 seats, and the only other stadium that beats it is the one Eskimos (Edmonton) plays at.

To build a stadium for NFL standards, plus the training facilities and all that jazz, would be too much headache I think for the NFL.

Also then there is the whole CAD dollar being crap compared to USD dollar, and do you pay the players in USD or CAD? Building a new stadium and the facilities will be in CAD and that probably drives a lot of people away (it will simply cost more to build in Canada than US just because of the difference of the dollar).

Just my 2cents.  I'm just surprised they dont do a couple pre-season games in Canada. I know there are a lot of Seahawks fans in Vancouver (because it's a 2hr drive for us) and it would be awesome to have a pre-season game or 2 in Canadaian cities.

Also, why do ou think a QB running 20 times a game is eventually going to get hurt? Simply because he has the label of a QB? Lamar had almost the exact same number of carries as Barkley did in their 3 year careers. Lamar had arguably a worse beating considering QB hits. Yet one is a bellcow running back but the other is injury prone?",nfl
"Meanwhile I've smoked in a hot tub with my dad at my sister's baby shower at like 2 am with like 4 other people there. He was 53 and was the one who brought it out. 

That sounds way trashier than it was. Though we did go body sledding down a hill in the sprinklers shortly thereafter.",nfl
"AFC Chiefs- Mahommes lost 2 of his best weapons and the league has a year of tape and an offseason to gameplan for him.

&amp;#x200B;

NFC Seattle Baldwin retired, Graham went to GB, lost Earl Thomas they traded Frank Clark and had a weird draft to say the least. Also as of now if Wilson goes down their back up is Paxton Lynch.

&amp;#x200B;

also Bears because I think they over achieved last season, lost Callahan, and lost Fangio. but I am biased so I went SEA",nfl
Was a shame you guys had two ahead of him on the roster. I was hoping he could be a backup and get more carries than he got in the end. But didn't he end up starting one or two pretty important games and put up 100+ yards? Or am I making that up?,nfl
"Yeah, I'm pissed.


But I get the concept of what happened. This is why aneurysm are so dangerous. They turned the system off, it caused a bit of air to get compressed, then they turned it back on. The air rapidly expanded in the first area of weakness.


I might send a letter to the city and see if they'll reimburse me for some of the cost. But at the end of the day, I still got the new pipes and water meter. So fuck it. It was partially my fault for having such an obvious weak point in my plumbing system.",nfl
"Blythe, Brockers, Fowler, Littleton, Fox, Higbee, Peters, Whitworth, Zeurlein, and a bunch of depth will all be FAs. Plus we'll be looking at extending Goff. There's gonna be some tough decisions for the staff to make. An expensive CB2 may well be a luxury we can't afford.

EDIT: I forgot Talib.",nfl
"He threw for more yards and touchdowns than Rivers did even with his 48 CMP%, and they still lost. The whole fucking team fell apart. He accounted for almost all of the team's yards! His 194 passing and 54 rushing yards were 87 percent of the team's total offense. He wasn't the problem, the entire offense was, which is why we fired the OC and are retooling the offense.",nfl
"If Cooper goes down we are in trouble. Witten is ancient. Cobb has serious injury issues, just like Austin and Hurns. All 3 of them (Cobb, Austin, Hurns) are cast offs because they couldnt produce up to their pay - IE they suck. Or at best, they are very mediocre. Gallup is unproven.

And I watch a ton of football. Thanks for asking.",nfl
"Injuries happen. They always happen. Who knows how many snaps he gets. Depth is critical. People can say “the jets aren’t contenders this year” all they want, but teams go from bad to good every year.

That being said... If the staff didn’t think he was good enough, that’s that. They know a shit more than we do.",nfl
"The problem for the Eagles (or really any team with a talented QB) is that if they don't pay it, someone else will.  It doesn't matter if you think he's got Bradford's level of injury proneness, someone will pay the man and the Eagles would look stupid if he leaves.

It's going to get interesting on how teams handle QBs in this league long term because the contracts are getting steep.",nfl
"Honestly, how are you going to sit back and bestow an honor on a man like that? It's one thing to have people like that in the Hall of Fame, but to name someone to the HOF after the fact is just too much. I don't want the NFL to be like Major League Baseball, but there is a pretty clear distinction between Pete Rose and Darren Sharper.",nfl
"I view it more as they're using the missed kick as a motivation tool moving forward. It's part of a culmination of the orgs kicking struggles over the last few years.

Getting on Parkey for going on TV wasn't about him ""letting it go"". It was more about the image they thought it made it about himself.

Kicking from the same spot is saying this is where the last guy failed and we need you to make it under pressure from here.",nfl
Favre was the best QB of the 90s imo. And easily the most exciting to watch in my lifetime. Skins have been awful since I started watching football and I have Favre to thank for keeping me interested. He was throwing 30+ TDs a year back before refs got touchy on PI calls.,nfl
"I'm not expecting that, as I stated further down we won't be drafting multiple all pros every draft obviously. But we do consistently find contributors. 

Guys beyond the 1st round who can quickly become starters and sustain that like Goldman, Whitehair, Amos, Howard, Daniels, Miller. Or guys that can be reliable depth and/or provide ST value like Kwiatkoski, Bush, Bullard, DHC, and Iggy. Not to mention UDFAs that become starters in Meredith, Callahan, RRH, and potentially Toliver. These are all hits in my book. 

Guys like Cohen and Jackson are more the home runs like Sherman and Chancellor that we may stumble across every few years. And none of that includes Floyd, Trubisky, and Roquan.",nfl
"I remember back then, there was this beautiful young woman that worked in a shop I would go to weekly. She was a Ravens fan during the days when our fanbases literally hated each other. We would poke fun at one another, but usually our conversations would involve just how good Peyton fuckin Manning was at the time. If he can trump our rivalry talks, that says something.",nfl
"Oh, a Charger fan. Of course, what was I thinking, it wasn't his fault. It was the O-line wasn't it? 

Hall of Fame quarterbacks don't get blitzed 88% of their snaps. When he can grow a pair and throw his noodle arm past 5 yards, then he might be able to actually go past the Divisional Round. 

Yeah I saw it, most disgraceful performance by a QB in the postseason ever. Changed the channel to Melrose by half-time. Did you?",nfl
"He was 59th, which sounds bad until you remember he didn’t participate in any Combine events except for the weigh in and the 40 yard dash (of which he scored in some of the highest  ever for both, and his Speed Score is one of the best ever for any position).

So basically, even if he had totally average scores for all WRs in vertical, broad jump, 3 cone and shuttle (which he probably did not, he probably had excellent scores there as well), he would still be roughly in the 95th percentile of WR athletes ever by virtue of his insane weight/speed ratio alone",nfl
"No, we analyzed THAT play. No one off my comment even made bust predictions or dogged him. Just straight up commented on the clip. In which he ran a weak route with bad footwork. Thats something teams do in football, watch tape from drills and practice and critique what happened in that moment to correct then learn from it. Take your asshole attitude somewhere else if you just wanna try to belittle people.",nfl
"I am saying that most of the key players on that team are still on the roster, last year an idiot of a head coach and even more dumbass of an OC came in and dismantled anything they had going. With the switching back to old defensive scheme and new offence it is okay to relate it to the team 2 years ago",nfl
"Flacco isn't good. He is scared to get hit. Will have happy feet and panic when the pass rush gets close.
It's hilarious when guys who only saw the mile high miracle (rocky Mountain rainbow) so long ago, comment about Flacco who hasn't been the same since his knee injury.

Too bad Bronco's you have a .500 team with Flacco.",nfl
"1st thing: I am aware of how powerful the U.S Armed Forces are without the usage of Nuclear weapons. Almost 50% of the average tax dollar goes to Military spending, and we spend more than the next 20 nations combined. I'm not a moron, I know how absolutely mighty we are. 



2nd thing: damn dude it was joke kinda a metaphor/joke wtf",nfl
"The fact that Kliff Kingsbury was a hotshot college football head coach is exactly why I don't think this will work out for the Cardinals. Steve Spurrier, Nick Saban, Bobby Petrino and Chip Kelly are reason enough for me to assert that coaches have to work their way up in the NFL if they expect to succeed in the league as head coaches.",nfl
"TBH it kinda bothers me a little bit. It looks great I  know that it would be structurally sound but I would fell a little uneasy sitting under that massive thing that is just being held by 4 cables.

Reminds me of those glass floors they have in some buildings that you can walk out on and look down. You know it is safe but it is still a little unnerving.",nfl
"Thank you. This is spot on and all that needs to be said. Can we end these threads now? The rest of these comments are just straight minutiae and regurgitation. Any average person who has done a single fantasy sports draft should be able to grasp what you just outlined and the concept of risk/reward at a high level. The world doesn’t end if you reach, but going off the odds of how it’s probably going to play out, you’re a dumbass. End of story",nfl
"Imagine Smith in an NFL that prioritizes passing to the point that running backs have more room on average than they ever have.

&gt;Bettis didn't do shit the year he won the SB either. Same goes for emmitt.

Smith won a Superbowl MVP and owns the record for most SB rushing TDs.

If you're insinuating that Frank Gore is as good or better than Emmitt Smith, I'm not sure what to say except that is a terrible take.",nfl
"The Sanchez Jets only played the Patriots once in the playoffs and won before losing to Pittsburgh in the AFCCG the next week.

The year before the Pats were btfo'd by the Ravens in the Wildcard round at home, Baltimore would go on to lose to the Colts in the Divisional round, and then the Colts would beat the Sanchez Jets (who had beaten Cincy and San Diego) in the AFCCG and then win the Super Bowl.",nfl
"The thing is, it's not even that I miss her. I'm over her and I'm not just saying that. It took probably about a year for me to get to that point too, but what she did was fucking awful and I don't want her in my life. But the scars are still there. The idea that you can be so incredibly in love with someone and *know* they won't ever hurt you but they can change in an instant is there. The feeling of never feeling like you're gonna be enough for anybody because they always choose other people is there. The trust issues from all the people you love abandoning you is there. It's not her, and I think in the beginning I tried to pin everything on her. It's the feeling of no one else caring, and the hopelessness of ever being in love again",nfl
"Different suggestions depending on what you're looking for in terms of ""giving it a shot"":

If you just want to dip your toes in, try *My Hero Academia*.  It's a pretty standard Western superhero story, but told in anime style.  It's well-produced and entertaining, comparable to a Marvel movie.

If you want to jump into the deep end with anime's version of Game of Thrones, try *Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood*.  It tops a lot of people's lists of best animes ever, and with good reason: a gripping story, amazing worldbuilding, complex politics, everything.

And if you've heard that anime is absurd and weird, and you really really want to jump head-first into the absurdity, try *Girls und Panzer*.  It's a sports anime about girls playing the after-school sport of...WWII tank combat.  That's right, nothing better than hearing the end-of-school bell ring so you can hop in a tank and blow people up!  But if you can swallow the wtf-level premise, it's a really exciting, charming, and hilarious show.",nfl
"Just because Mac and co.  wanted a 5th for weeks didn't mean they were going to get it obviously.  We got a 6th for cut bait and a guy they didn't want.  So what if he was a 1st in 16, deal is done, move on.  Better than nothing which I thought as a Jets fan we would just end up cutting him and get nothing.",nfl
"Every game I’ve watched of him he hasn’t shown anything that makes me think he’s a long term answer. He had an insane cast and made the playoffs off the back of everyone else.

It reminds me of everyone acting like Mark Sanchez was the second coming a decade ago on a team with a top 3 defense and the best running game and o-line in the NFL. Now obviously he’s not Sanchez bad but I don’t think he’s *that* much bettet",nfl
Additionally I believe your quoted statement is wrong. Sure that guy may stop watching the NFL (spoiler - he won't) but the largest outcry will be from people who don't watch football anyway. Just like every other one of these PR issues the NFL has. Football fans will forget in a minute because the point of the NFL is entertainment - watching the game - not the politics that surround it.,nfl
"Im a Bucs fan. We didn’t dodge a bullet. I really don’t think he would’ve made the situation between Raheem-Schitzano(yes Ik)-Lovie-Koetter any worse. It would’ve made it worse for the Bucs, yes, but I think the coaching situation would’ve caused his issues to become overlooked. The glazers are the type of owners that would’ve let him play out the contract while cutting a fan favorite like McCoy.",nfl
"I feel that the Rams have the best chance in the NFC West even with changes in the offseason. I just don't see the Hawks or Cards turning it around that much this year, and the 9ers always find new and exciting ways to screw it up lately. You can never know though, especially compared to other divisions.",nfl
"They had a great defense and a great offense minus the QB that year which is why they made the playoffs even with Hoyer. His garbage performance was made to look competent that year by his supporting cast, which is why he never had anything even resembling NFL success aside from that year. If you're playing at a starting level and the starters around you are good, you look a hell of a lot better than a bare minimum starter who's just making it by the seat of his pants like Brian Hoyer was that season.",nfl
"Thanks! And for the record it was a Chiefs fan who convinced me of that :P Main reasons I was higher on Ford was a significantly higher snap percentage played on your defense while Jones was rotated in/out more (Jones only played 64.2% of your teams defensive snaps while Ford played a much higher 85.9%) which is an enormous gap if Ford is playing 20% higher snaps.  Then Ford also was much, much better at avoiding missed tackles than Jones (7 for Jones, 4 for Ford, and on a per tackle basis, Jones missed a tackle more than twice as much than Ford).  Jones was slightly more efficient on a pass rush and run defense basis, but because of their large gap in snap usage, not only is that somewhat expected, but Ford had slightly better volume.  Ford also had 6 forced fumbles to Jones' 2, though Jones had more TFLs (19 vs 13).  But yeah, overall, it was that Ford was so much better in tackling, and snap percentage, while in the other areas, they were more or less a wash.",nfl
"Since Rodgers became a starter, McCarthy is 6-12-1 without Rodgers. 3 of those 6 wins were vs the 5-11 Bears, 5-11 Bucs in OT, and the 0-16 Browns in overtime. They had to go into overtime to beat the 0-16 Browns without Rodgers. McCarthy was good, but he lost his fastball and the league figured him out.",nfl
You're sleeping on Wentz because he's been hurt. He was the obvious MVP before he got hurt in 2017 and then compounded it by coming back too early in 2018. But the talent is there. We've seen it. It's just a matter of staying healthy. It has nothing to do with talent.,nfl
"The fact that you're pointing out coaching as a bad thing, is proof you know nothing about the Phins. Flores is a good defensive coach that should have Miami's defense playing a lot better, taking pressure off Rosen to have to win games. Combine that with Caldwell who has coached Stafford and Flacco to their best seasons as qbs, along with vastly improving Manning's stats in the first year he coached him, has Rosen in great hands. He also has pretty good receivers. He also has McDaniels heir apparent as his oc, and a running game that should take the pressure off him. Rosen also has pretty good play action fake which will help him further. 

Rosen led the league in sacks under 2.5 seconds, the fact that you expected him to have success in those conditions for a rookie qb is frankly ludicrous. Furthermore, if all you care about are stats, frankly speaking, his stats weren't that far off from both Allen's and Darnold's stats, but yet people seem to think Rosen is a bust and Allen + Darnold are franchise qbs. Discounting the fact that Allen + Darnold had better teams. Furthermore, Rosen is at this point a much more developed passer then both Allen + Lamar yet people are already writing him off when he is only 22. It's frankly dumb.

Not to mention that Rosen is already doing things like going through reads in the NFL and looking off safeties as a rookie.",nfl
"I applied for a job in LA. The recruiter got back to me like within 5 minutes of when I submitted my application. I followed up as she wanted me to finish some paperwork application and she ignored me. I emailed her the next day to follow up to see if the availability works. She says no and says how about next week? She ignored me for like 5 days. I had to call the office number to get to her because she would ignore her own phone calls. She immediately said I'm busy but then immediately gave me a schedule for an interview. I am already super turned off by this job because she's incompetent as fuck. 

I seriously hate recruiters and I don't get people like her. What do you fucking do all the day that you can't help people who are trying to get a job?",nfl
"Just went down a rabbit hole with Hernandez... he was gay, maybe bisexual, but most likely gay. 

1) He was in a hidden relationship with his HS QB which started in middle school. At the same time, he dated his fiancee. Him and the guy broke things off when HS ended. 

2) In college, his then gf caught him sending texts to another man after coming back from a vacation. 

3) In prison he met his gay lover who he left a $50k watch among other things. 

4) Hernandez confided in his lawyer about his inter-battle surrounding his sexuality. He also admitted to having a sexual relationship with a friend who he and his fiancee both knew. 

Apparently his fiancee had no clue about his sexuality until after his death. She wasn't upset at him, but upset at the burden he held in by himself. 

According to Hernandez's brother, their father was also terrible abusive person who nailed Hernandez in because of his femininity.",nfl
"He was inconsistent all year. I would take 10-15 guys over him.

&gt; his 16.2 yards per catch allowed was the second-worst among corners

That fact isn’t bias. His job is not to give up catches/yards and he was the 2nd worst at that job. That is not top 10 CB material, not at all.

[Here](https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/pro-top-25-cornerbacks-in-the-nfl-in-2018) is the article. Ranked 16th.",nfl

Doesn’t surprise me he was able to graduate after the long hiatus, especially with the reputation and regard the school holds for him.",nfl
"“Big Nickel” bring in a third safety rather than a 3rd Cb and is the base defense for most teams. Combine that with many linebackers now weighting 230 and you can see how power running could be primed to make a comeback. 

Fortunately the patriots decided to just be terrible at defending running backs in the passing game and our linebackers are all 240-270 pounds.",nfl
"Yea, that's a fun fact.

I'm not saying they weren't great, but it is undeniable that they we're leaning hard on how the refs call penalties.

The Patriots do that sort of meta-gaming all the time.

Either way, it's nowhere near as bad as the Broncos playing fast and loose with the salary cap.",nfl
"I like this scenario, but not for the Super Bowl. 

It's because to make the playoffs with 3 wins, it means the Cowboys, Eagles &amp; Racists all only have 2 or fewer wins as well. That'd be amaaaaazing. Is it even mathematically possible to have a whole division go 3W 2W 2W 2W? Let's do the math!",nfl
"It's because NCAA teams are running the spread offense and you need faster, smaller LBs to keep up with them.  

That was Detroit GM Bob Quinn's reasoning for drafting Jahlani Tavai in Round 2, because he's 250 lbs and has a huge wingspan and there just aren't a lot of linebackers that size anymore.  He was likely afraid the Patriots would draft him.",nfl
"Did he amass some stats last season?  By no means did I ever watch the Raiders and think he looked good last year.  

PFF agrees with me.  They had him right around 20th for the season, in between the likes of Dak Prescott and Joe Flacco.  So....a Dalton line QB at best.  

I think the ""Jared Cook"" as leading receiver was a feature, and not a bug.  For some strange reason, Carr has been unable to get the ball to his WRs for two seasons now.  Amari looked adequate once he got out of Oakland.  I refuse to believe he alone was the problem.  

I do agree with you that if Jared Cook is your offense's leading receiver, that is indicative of a problem.  I think the problem is probably more just Carr than an extreme lack of talent at the WR position.  I guess we'll find out this season.",nfl
"Ehhh

People seriously underestimate the skill creep from the early 90s until now. Favre had numerous years where he was actually just shit. Like, to the point where the numbers are funny.

Here's [a comparison](http://pfref.com/tiny/lFYhk) of a 4 year stretch of play 10 years apart. Pretty damn close for a HOFer and a near-meme.",nfl
"He was really freaking bad. Alex Smith played like shit but he still had some moments, which is why he ended up starting so many games (well that and he was the #1 overall pick). But Pickett was so bad you just couldn’t keep him in the game for fear of embarrassing yourself.",nfl
"I’m not hating at all! The dude can dunk and he’s got a hundred pounds on me. But he’s probably 6’7 or so and has a big wingspan. A 6’ tall guy dunking looks like they take off and he doesn’t get very high. Please don’t think I’m hatin on a big man who can dunk. He’s just very much taller than the title and his bio states.

I looked it up and someone who is 6’ needs a 30” vertical to dunk. By my eye the dude maybe got a foot off the ground. The dude is an absolute monster. 6’  is like when the coach asks you what is your height, in high school I was 6’ but in the program I was 6’3” hahaha 

Edit: that was football though, but the coaches encouraged us to put down whatever we wanted. I wanted to be big, maybe in basketball you want your opponent to think you’re smaller? Idk but this dude isn’t 6’ haha",nfl
"As someone from Ohio who loves chili, that's more of a chili sauce. In Ohio there's basically two types. A chili you can eat with a spoon (meat, beans, onions, etc) and then there's the meat sauce like what you had. I think skyline is awful. The best chili you can get to get a taste of the good stuff is Tony Packos. It's really only used for making chili dogs but oh my god it's amazing. Tony Packos is a hot dog place in Toledo, the original one there first opened up in like, 1930 or so. They come in small cans and are usually $3 or so. It is fantastic. As someone from ohio, fuck skyline it's terrible. but don't give up on that style of chili, it's perfect and really only meant for chili dogs. It has heat to it, I wouldn't call or hot or spicy at all, but it's there, and it's got a slight cinnamon-y taste to combine with the meat sauce flavor. I really can't do it justice. As a topping, there's literally no chili that's better",nfl

"Well by definition the owners are taking on more risk if there is more guarantee. How is that not obvious?

I think your theoretical league is so far off base tho

These guys are paid so fucking handsomely. They have a LOWER death rate relative to the rest of the population. They certainly deserve their share of the pie (50%), but don’t make it out like they’re paying these dudes who are risking their lives. There’s more than enough professions where the death rate is much much higher and are paid a fraction of what these guys are paid


In reality it’d be a race to who has the least amount of dead money in the last 3 years. 

Finally any sort of paying over the cap for extreme injury will probably never happen as you’d be circumventing the salary cap and would reward richer owners. The NFL does an excellent job allowing the cash poor owners from still being very competitive, something not seem nearly as much in the NBA / MLB.",nfl
"Unless you are QB or HC, rings are more of a team accomplishment...

"Pot needs to be clinically researched. Extensively. For it to have so many effects on people, and for those effects to be present or not in different magnitudes between different people is wonky.  
  
I smoke pot. Never did it before 21, never bought myself until this past couple years.  
  
I, *alone*, have had an absurdly variable experience with it. I’ve deciphered at least enough to know the differences between sativa and indica on me, but that really doesn’t tell the whole story.  
  
I went blind (think tunnel vision, but the tunnel “closed” for a certain duration) my first time smoking. Got the same symptom the next two times. Wasn’t until I was trying to smash a hot pothead that I smoked it and had a good experience.  
  
Good symptoms: giddiness (sativa), outgoingness (sativa), creativity (both), pain relief, nausea relief, increased sensitivity, and 
  
Bad symptoms: Blindness (as stated), paralysis (not technically, but a loss of balance and a strange pulsing from my center that was so fucked up that I didn’t dare do anything but lie down with my eyes closed), time dilation, cluster headaches so bad that I went to the ER (honestly I thought it was my eye that was experiencing terrible pain, but it was behind my eye), anxiety.  
  
Currently a couple days sober, but I really question the shit I got last time from my dealer. Wound up smoking every day, becoming a recluse, and getting nothing done to the point that my house is an absolute disaster. The fact that I kept smoking it regardless of everything else makes me wonder if it was laced or something.  
  
Might not be, though. Thing is, MJ’s not chemically addictive like stimulants or depressants, but it’s mentally addictive, the same way video games or sex are. If you enjoy it, and it releases lots of dopamine into your system, then you’ll want to do it again because you enjoyed it. Dopamine is your body’s trigger to keep doing whatever you’re doing.  
  
Weed makes me lazy. Honestly, I think I’m currently addicted to it (or, as mentioned before, to whatever the fuck’s in it), so I’ve resolved not to buy any more for a couple of weeks, and only smoke on weekends or with company. I can’t blame it exclusively, but it definitely helped put me into a bad mindset and helped perpetuate that cycle.  
  
Anyway, for the purposes of this sub and context, I can confirm the pain relief, and also that lots of high-functioning adults around me smoke pretty regularly without any dips in their efficiency and whatnot. It’s no worse for you than booze, and it doesn’t incite aggression. It should be legalized not only in the NFL but everywhere.  
  
But, as said, be wary; it can have negative consequences, and is best done in moderation, as are most things.",nfl
"Trust me, we know. 

We love those guys. Having three (future and current) Hall of Famers on offense, AND a great defense, and to not make the SB... It's a damn shame. I have rooted for LT wherever he went, too; also own a NYJ LT jersey for Christ's sake!

those teams were so damn good and so damn fun.",nfl

Now consider something actually worth discussing, like McNabb and Aikman compared to their own eras. Overall they come out pretty similar, as this analysis shows, but one of them played significantly better in the playoffs on aggregate, including a few fantastic Super Bowl performances, on his way to three championship victories while the other played overall worse in the postseason and had some extreme stinkers in years where his team had its best chances to win.   
   

And specifically for the context of this topic, this article only came up because yesterday McNabb talked about being a Hall of Famer because of his numbers compared to Aikman's, but the Hall of Fame isn't just about numbers and never has been (particularly for QBs, and as silly as that sounds see: Ken Anderson, John Hadl, John Brodie, Boomer etc.). You can't take rings away from Aikman's HoF case because championships are integral to ""fame."" You can argue McNabb was as or more talented based on an analysis like this one, but that's why you get people bringing up rings because Aikman played damn well in the postseason on the way to those rings while McNabb mostly did not and, for better or worse, will be remembered as the guy who puked on the field trying to run a hurry up offense.",nfl

Eli was a good but not great QB from 2009-2012, and for the rest of his career has been average at best.

I double checked, and do concede that Eli is slightly better than Flacco careerwise, and that on the net he was a barely better than league average starter.

Regardless, being like the 14th or 15th best starter in the NFL on average does not make anyone a great or even good player.

"This is an interesting distinction since bitcoin can be used as a currency.  Wouldn't this sort of be asking to be paid in another form of currency (the euro, or something along those lines) that happens to be significantly more variable in price?

So if they are compensated with say $1,000,000 of fair market value stock, and don't need to spend any money in exercising that option then immediately they are taxed on 1 million in income.  Future gains/losses have capital gains rates apply.  

You could be thinking of qualified stock options, but those have a holding period and other restrictions.  If you are given qualified stock options and hold them long enough then you don't get taxed at the income rate on it at all, and instead only deal with capital gains when you sell the stock.

Oh, and stock options generally have a cost associated with them, so you can buy the stock at a specified price (depending on the deal that price can be above, below, or at fair market value) and these all play a role in how it impacts your taxes.",nfl

"&gt; Not to mention, Kittle putting most of those numbers up with CJ Beathard and Nick Mullens and no real big threats around him.

That's because every defense wasn't allowing any big plays against them, so they were taking away everything deep and selling out to the run. It opened the middle of the field, allowing Kittle to get one on one matches that are favorable due to a Safety over the top and a Safety crashing the box.

Kittle's success is completely due to a team that went 4-12. SF was 13th in rushing, which sounds good, until you find they were last in rushing TD's. Good run blocking teams do phenomenal in redzone TD's. For a team that ranked in the top 15 in offensive stats, they also ranked in the bottom 5 in scoring.  This is what happens when defenses play a bend but don't break style against you, where they take away everything they can that gives up big plays. You get garbage yards throughout the game but can't push anything in the redzone.

"&gt;You seem to believe that for a QB the entire question is basically a) passing stats and b) factors that affect passing stats.

I believe this is a much better start and estimate than any other method of analysis that Ive seen so far.  If someone was to go through and watch film on Brady/Manning from the start, and not passively like fans like to say I watched their games, one of them looked better, but really delve into the kind of adjustments they make on the line, their throwing ability, movement in the pocket etc, and then chart what they find important and present all of this as detailed proof of who is better, that would be comprehensive, and better than looking at passing stats.

But otherwise, passing stats and their related context are the next best way to analyze QBs.  Looking at wins and assuming the QB played better during a win is significantly worse, especially when so many QBs get recognition for wins when they make the game winning drive (even though they weren't good for most of the game and the reason the game was so close), or for a game losing pick or failure to convert (even though their great play before that was the reason they were still in the game).

QBs affect the NFL through their passing offense, and to various degrees, their rushing offense.  Thats it.  I can understand looking at passing or offensive based stats, but looking at wins and trying to, for some reason, add the effects of the defense and special teams into the equation (obviously how they play affects the offense on starting possession and ToP, but in this case we're integrating their actual play), makes no sense when judging a player who plays no defense or special teams.",nfl

That's the courts ruling. Anything in there related to the Wells Report or Evidence? No? Ok then. Whether or not the NFL has evidence *is meaningless to the courts!*

"With infinite parallel universes where anything that can happen will happen, yes, he has 9 rings.  

Shit, if we're really talking this, there's a reality where Brady plays a year earlier and takes to the Patriots to 20 straight Superbowl victories.  lol 

QB play is always so far from perfect.  You can find almost any incompletion, interception, toss away or whatever and identify somewhere, somehow that a throw could have been made, even if it would have been very tough.  So even getting near that consistently, play after play, season after season, they could basically win pretty much every game.  And this is all \*entirely\* possible, just unfathomably unlikely.  But with infinite parallel universes, this will happen countless times, all with variations of each other, sometimes super minor(maybe a certain throw of one drive of one game of one of those seasons is thrown a few inches more to the left, and this is the only difference in the entire universe's history from a different one...).

Denver signed 10 free agents in the wake of the 2011 draft, and the Kansas cornerback received only a $2,000 bonus. “I knew I was the last spot,” Harris joked, “because I got the smallest signing bonus.” On the first official depth chart prior to the first preseason game, Harris was listed as the fourth-string left cornerback.

Despite his humble beginnings, Harris made the 53-man roster on the strength of special teams play, and by Week 7 of his rookie year earned the slot cornerback role, picking up First-Team All-Rookie honors at the conclusion of the campaign. His coming out party came a year later, when he started outside for the Broncos in Week 6 and picked off veteran Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers twice. Harris made his first Pro Bowl in 2014, helped the Broncos win the Super Bowl in the 2015 season, and was named First-Team All-Pro in 2016. After signing a five-year, $42.5 MM extension in 2014, it probably became a lot easier to joke about his $2,000 signing bonus.

Harris as a Draft Prospect
With the benefit of hindsight, it’s easy to say Harris should have been drafted—heck, he should have been a first-round pick. But even understanding how excellent Harris has been, it’s hard to look back and pinpoint what separates him from the legion of similar players who go undrafted each April.

Harris was a tackle machine for Kansas, logging 290 in his four seasons with the Jayhawks, but he didn’t have desirable on-ball production in the passing game. After three interceptions in his first two years, he didn’t have any as a junior, though he did compile nine passes defensed. As a senior, he shifted to safety for half the season, likely further depressing his numbers. He finished with no interceptions and only one pass defensed. Consequently he did not win All-Conference honors apart from All-Big 12 Freshman accolades in 2007. 

You can trace the lack of accolades even further for Harris. A late-bloomer, he considered himself more of a basketball player until his senior year of high school, when he realized his prospects were better in football and dedicated himself to his craft. That came too late for recruiting services and big-time college programs; Harris was rated a two-star athlete by Rivals and was lightly-recruited. Even though he earned early playing time in Lawrence, the lack of recruiting buzz often sticks with area scouts, who are responsible for evaluating hundreds of players.

Moving to safety undoubtedly hurt Harris’ status apart from its effect on his statistics. At 5’9” and 194 pounds, Harris is undersized even for a cornerback, and well below most teams’ size thresholds for a safety. The rest of his athletic profile was fine; nothing that would raise a red flag, but also no outstanding speed, explosiveness, or movement skills that would make Harris stand out from any of the dozens of other draft-eligible defensive backs.


Harris was also a victim of circumstance. The Jayhawks finished 12-1 in his freshman season, beating Virginia Tech in the Orange Bowl to earn a #7 overall ranking. They went 8-5 the next year, again winning a bowl game, and started 5-0 in Harris’ junior year. That was when the wheels came off. Head coach Mark Mangino was investigated for improper treatment of players, the team closed the season with seven straight losses, and Mangino was forced to resign at the end of the year. The Jayhawks’ skid continued in Turner Gill’s first year as head coach, with the team finishing 3-9. No Kansas players were selected in the 2011 draft, and Harris was the first to sign a UDFA contract.

The coaching turmoil likely hurt Harris politically, too. He had the respect of his peers—his Jayhawks teammates voted him captain twice—but Gill didn’t recruit Harris and his endorsement to NFL teams likely wasn’t as strong as Mangino’s would have been had he stayed. And a somewhat-disgraced Mangino vouching for Harris in 2011 wouldn’t carry as much weight as it would have two years earlier.

Kansas isn’t known as a football hotbed, but even so Harris was overshadowed by more heralded teammates in the defensive backfield. Aqib Talib, for several years a Broncos teammate, had rare NFL size and was a first-round pick in 2008. Darrell Stuckey won First-Team All-Big 12 honors and was a fourth-round pick as a safety.

Harris also suffered from a prejudice against slot cornerbacks. While he has proven he can play outside as well, like most players with less-than-ideal height, most teams saw him as a inside corner. Despite more and more teams running three wide receiver sets more and more often, teams don’t view the slot corner as a starter and don’t invest much in the position. That mentality is changing, but still exists to a large degree. A recent example is Desmond King, who won the Jim Thorpe Award as the best defensive back in college football but fell to the fifth round of the 2017 draft amid concerns that his size and speed would relegate him to “only” a slot guy. King has made that pick pay off for the Los Angeles Chargers, winning All Pro honors in 2018.

So Harris was a perfect storm of factors that cause teams to overlook a player: small, just OK measurables, unremarkable production, a losing program, a coach that hadn’t recruited him, an unfortunate position change, more-renowned teammates, and projected to a slot role that teams undervalue. But he was smart, competitive, and quick, and he could cover and tackle, and ultimately all those positive qualities outweighed all the factors that caused teams to pass over him in the draft.

What Matters for Cornerbacks
Cornerback requires some physical excellence, certainly—there aren’t a lot of good corners who are 5’7” or run 4.70 40s—but the biggest, fastest players aren’t necessarily the ones with coverage ability or ball skills. Those qualities are more nuanced. Can you stay patient at the line of scrimmage? How refined is your footwork? Can you read the receiver’s vertical stem? Can you react to his movements without overreacting? Can you track the ball in the air? Read the quarterback’s eyes in zone? Do you know when to turn and look for the ball and when to play the receiver’s hands? These skills aren’t going to show up in Combine drills, and they’re not necessarily going to show up in the stat sheet either.

So maybe we shouldn’t be surprised that Harris is just one of several late-round or undrafted cornerbacks to find NFL success. Seattle’s Legion of Boom was anchored by corners Richard Sherman (fifth round) and Brandon Browner (undrafted, signed from the Canadian Football League), two cornerbacks with very different body types than Harris but who won with tremendous length, physicality, and ball skills. The Seahawks’ chances at a Super Bowl repeat were dashed by Malcolm Butler, an undrafted, undersized signee from tiny West Alabama. The next year, the Carolina Panthers met Harris’ Broncos in the Super Bowl; one of Carolina’s star playmakers with Josh Norman, a fifth-rounder from small-school Coastal Carolina who ran a poor 40 time but had size, competitiveness, and ball skills. Brent Grimes, A.J. Bouye, and Sam Shields are more examples of undrafted cornerbacks who have had long and productive careers.

With the rise of spread offenses, teams need more and more depth in the defensive secondary to run the nickel and dime defenses that have become increasingly prevalent. Savvy teams will find that they don’t always need to invest top picks to add to their cornerback depth, if they can isolate the critical factors that make for excellence on the football field. These factors aren’t always going to stand out in the pre-draft process. The good news for future prospects who don’t meet NFL ideals is that, because teams can never have too many cornerbacks, they will always be looking for the next undrafted gem. The next Chris Harris, Jr.",nfl

"**Part XI: Picking Up Where He Left Off**

The year is 2000. As we entered the new millennium, everyone was changing their tune about Wade Richey. This included head coach Steve Mariucci, who, during a training camp session, [said that he liked the kicker](https://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/Clark-champing-at-the-bit-for-practice-time-3052201.php) and called him the best in the league. Richey was a guy in Mariucci’s doghouse, and now, was being praised for his efforts. And again, it’s no surprise why he was being praised- [he set a then-franchise record for accuracy](https://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/CAPSULES-NFC-WEST-2707550.php) by hitting 91.3% of his field goals. Combined with the two postseason games from the 1998 season and the week 17 game from that season, and he had made 28 of his last 30 kicks, or 93.3% of them.

So it was no surprise when Richey was the starting kicker for the 49ers entering the 2000 season, and why [they re-signed him in free agency](https://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/Young-Rice-still-in-limbo-3075093.php). Yes, things were going to be different in 2000 for the 49ers, as they just hired Bruce DeHaven, [the former Bills special teams coach](https://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/49ers-Hire-Bills-DeHaven-To-Coach-Special-Teams-2779289.php), for the position. But they were keeping their now-accurate kicker in place. [I wonder what play caused DeHaven to lose his job with the Bills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuHffewDHpk).

In the first two games of the season, Richey didn’t attempt a field goal. San Francisco lost 36-28 to the Falcons and 38-22 to the Panthers, but all Richey did during that game was kick extra points. He would get his opportunities to kick after that, though; in a week three game against the Rams, where the 49ers lost 41-24, he made his first field goal of the season from 21 yards out. In week four, a 41-24 victory over the Dallas Cowboys and the team’s first win of the season, Richey was 2-for-2, drilling a 38-yard kick in the first quarter and a 47-yard kick in the third quarter. And, in week five, a 27-20 victory over the Arizona Cardinals back at Candlestick Park, Richey was 2-for-2, hitting field goals from 33 and 27 yards out.

Through five weeks in 2000, Richey was 5-for-5. He had now made 33 of his last 35 kicks. Since week 17 of the 1998 season, he was hitting on 94.3% of his kicks. For a guy that couldn’t hit anything in college and anything as a rookie, everything had changed. The switch had been flipped. He was picking up right where he left off; through five weeks, he was as automatic as he was in 1999.

Then… just like that… he wasn’t.

**Part XII: A Costly Miss**

The San Francisco 49ers were coming off an abysmal 4-12 season in 1999, where their run of dominance was seemingly coming to an end. An 0-3 start to the 2000 season didn’t help their cause at all. Combined with the divisional loss to the Atlanta Falcons in the 1998 postseason, and in San Francisco’s last 20 games after three weeks in 2000, the 49ers were 4-16, and had won just 20 percent of their games.

Things were bleak in San Francisco. But it looked as though their luck was turning. A 41-24 victory over their hated rival, the Dallas Cowboys, was a start. Followed by a 27-20 victory over the Arizona Cardinals to give the team their first home win of the season, and the 49ers had a chance to get back to .500. To do it, they’d need to defeat their Bay Area rival, the Oakland Raiders.

Initially, it didn’t look like they were going to do it. At the start of the fourth quarter, when Rich Gannon [scored a 13-yard rushing touchdown](https://youtu.be/HlEygLsZVHM?t=5517) to give the Raiders a 28-14 lead, it looked like the 49ers weren’t going to do it. To climb out of a 14-point hole against one of the best teams in football (the Raiders went 12-4 that season, and were 3-1 coming off of a bye week entering the 49ers game) was a tall task on paper.

But then, [Jeff Garcia found Terrell Owens in a display of TO magic](https://youtu.be/HlEygLsZVHM?t=6012) to make it 28-21. Not even two minutes later, [Jeff Garcia threw another touchdown pass](https://youtu.be/HlEygLsZVHM?t=6244) to tie the game at 28-28. The 49ers had climbed out of their hole, and tied the game. Eventually, the game went into overtime, and [Sebastian Janikowski missed this 35-yard field goal](https://youtu.be/HlEygLsZVHM?t=7729), the 49ers had a legitimately good shot to win this game.

San Francisco drove down the field. From their own 25-yard line, they got into Oakland territory. From there, they got into field goal range. And after [Terrell Owens picked up 19 yards by stiff-arming a Raider defender into the shadow realm](https://youtu.be/HlEygLsZVHM?t=8124), the 49ers had the ball at Oakland’s 11-yard line. It would set up a 29-yard field goal for Wade Richey. A chance to be the hero in overtime. The man who had hit 33 of his last 35 kicks was lining up for an absolute chip shot to give San Francisco their third straight win.

[It got blocked](https://youtu.be/HlEygLsZVHM?t=8238).

The kick was really low. Oakland won the game on [a touchdown pass from Gannon to Tim Brown](https://youtu.be/HlEygLsZVHM?t=8515). Richey’s low kick was the talking point for why the 49ers couldn’t win the game when they had it at Oakland’s 11-yard line in overtime. [He admitted that he could’ve made the kick with his eyes closed](https://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/49ERS-NOTEBOOK-Richey-Takes-Blame-For-Blocked-2702264.php) because it was that close. And he missed. The locker room after the game [was nothing short of somber](https://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/49ers-Had-Their-Shot-Didn-t-Take-It-3238613.php). 

It was a horrible time to miss your first kick of the season. Often times, you can pinpoint the exact moment where things turn south. For Wade Richey, that blocked kick was the moment that it all fell down.",nfl

Minnesota lost 1.5 starters in Sheldon Richardson and Andrew Sendejo (who lost his job to current starter Anthony Harris anyway).

The offense hasn't lost any pieces but has reloaded the offensive line, our Achilles heel for the last 6 seasons, with young talent through the draft. Now, draft picks don't always pan out, but I can't overstate how much our bad, injured offensive line has capped our ceiling (and last year our floor) over the years 

Now in regards to coaching we've brought in Kubiak as an offensive assistant to work with our newish OC, Kevin Stefanski, on running his classic outside zone offense. This system is perfectly tailored to Dalvin Cook's vision and burst, our athletic O-line, Kirk's strength in play-action, and our arguably elite west coast style WR's.

Basically, our weaknesses we're so crippling that it's unlikely to get much worse and our strengths haven't changed at all.

That's like calling a DT an INTERIOR lineman or an IDL lineman. You're using both the abbreviation and typing out the whole position name.

"Feel free to correct me if I’m wrong, but LaFleur plans on calling his own plays and will be heavily involved in the offensive planning since Pettine has been given full control over the defense. I’d assume Hackett’s main job is to be a sounding board and help put it all together. Hackett’s definitely put together good game plans before, he just seems to be really bad at actually calling the game, which won’t be a concern in GB.",nfl
"Probably biased was the wrong word to use.

"He had a couple of down years but there's been a lot of transition in Tampa and I'm not sure it's all his fault that his numbers went down recently. He's probably the main focal point of that DL so he's getting double teamed constantly and they've had some scheme changes to adjust to.

I think he'll get 2nd tier elite $$ (not Clark/Ford money, but fairly close), a big part of the problem is just that a lot of teams have already spent their big $ and now finding a team that still needs elite DL talent and is ABLE to pay for it is tough.",nfl

"Not even talking through bias, but they'll be fighting for \#2 in the division.

One of the other three will have a great year with everything falling into place and the Steelers will have their fair share of troubles. They lost two top talents - albeit they didn't have Bell anyway - and a top-of-the-line OL coach (which some people are underestimating how much of an effect that can have. Just because a unit is kept mostly the same doesn't mean you'll have the same results, just ask the Falcons). Just look at week 17 last year, in a must win game against a horrible Bengals team that'd completely given up on the season and didn't even have their starting QB, the Steelers struggled to put them away without Brown on the field. Sure you could argue that removing Brown is somewhat good since you're removing a distraction, but that affect is mitigated by losing a player that is likely the best at the position. He definitely brought his negatives obviously, but yoou can't deny that at times last year he was the only player making waves on that offense - if it weren't for him that first Ravens game might've been a shutout. Also they really need Washington, and every other WR, to take a big step opposite JuJu to keep the same level of offensive potency.

On top of that they didn't really address their biggest defensive issues in the secondary - Nelson is solid but nothing special and is a player that could very easily decline back to what he was before last season (and even last season it's not like he was lighting it up on one of the worst defenses in the NFL), I liked Layne but he's a rookie, and beyond that they're relying on Edmunds and Davis to take a big step next year at safety. They didn't add much else at CB, so the guy that they just declined the 5th year option on will be relied on again even with Nelson and Layne on the team. Also they're relying on Bush to be able to come in and be a good ILB immediately.

I think it's perfectly fair to expect a decline. Could be better, but 8-8 is the realistic projection.",nfl

"Being on the same page on something for once is a bit of a nice change of pace.

With 4QCs I think the definition and measuring problem just gets so thorny (which is one of the reasons that to the extent you care about it it can make some real sense to just lean on subjective analysis/eyeball test) and I'm dubious that improvements at the margins (other than really simple ones such as here) provide much value relative to the effort expended. Sussing out comeback size, clock time, pre-4Q comebacks from extremely large deficits, cases where a blown comeback isn't the QB's fault (and where in those cases it still kind of is to some degree because the QB only led one scoring drive in the 4th while the defense only allowed one and it just so happened to be after the comeback drive)...  you'd have to go to an insane amount of effort with a lot of difficult decisions to get a significantly sounder stat.

And at the end of the day I think, while in an objective sense of course these things matter, it's a lot easier to treat 4QCs as trivia and just fold them up into the larger question of QB quality and performance.

It's like if we spent time statistically assessing how QBs perform on end of first half drives. Even if you get past definitional problems and conclude that, say, Drew Brees is surprisingly bad at them and that's a real effect and Ben Roethlisberger is the end-of-first-half god and that's also a real effect, you're spending a ridiculous amount of time breaking down a portion of a QBs performance when you should really be caring about the full picture anyway and a QB being particularly good or bad in this area will tend to be ""baked in"" to those larger numbers anyway.",nfl

There were two games in, I think 2010? It was Garrard's last year as a starter. We beat the Texans on a last second hail mary throw to Mike Thomas (actually the ball went right to a defender, he batted the ball like he was supposed to, but he batted it right into Mike Thomas' hands). Then, another game was against the Colts where we beat them on a last second 58 yarder from Scobee. Those were just two really exciting finishes against division rivals.

To me it's when a team is underrated that they become an underdog.

Seeing KC top the power rankings all season last year was a perfect example of this: power rankings have become glorified standings.  We beat KC and they did nothing to show anyone a rematch would go a different way.  KC should not have been above us in the power rankings last year.

There can only be one real factor, leverage on ownership.  In SF's case, the question is whether the NFL can sell 49ers ownership that the 49ers stadium is still in the rotation for hosting another Super Bowl, especially once the LA and Las Vegas stadiums are built.

&gt;Unlike PFF’s awards, the 101 factors in the postseason, so some players who won PFF awards may find themselves jumped in the 101 by rivals who had a playoff run worthy of a change in ranking.

Seems like your main criticisms are outright debunked by their own stated methodology you never even bothered to look up.

As for how Brady got a top 5 QB grade without top 5 advanced stats, they are very clear in their grading methodology that they post all over their site that the grades are based on a system of judging every snap on a +2 to -2 scale.

To me it's still a little hazy what ""top 100 players of the 2018 season"" means, because if it's just guys with the best numbers, just rank them by numbers.  If a guy is the best WR in the league when healthy, but was dragged down by poor QB play while guys like Julio, Hopkins, Thomas and Hill have Pro Bowl caliber QBs in Ryan, Watson, Brees and Mahomes to pump up their numbers, there has to be some kind of qualitative analysis going on that normalizes the environment they're in.

In other words, let's say you agree he's the #1 WR in football, and is now moving to a team with a QB who will put him in position to put up the best numbers.  Would you leave him off the 2018 list altogether if you knew he'd be a top-10 player in 2019?

"&gt;	No other QB in NFL history has had defensive support like that for such a sustained period. 
  
  

Joe Montana’s Niners averaged ***5th*** in scoring defense. The one year they weren’t 8th or better the team went 3-6 and missed the playoffs. The years they won the super bowl the unit ranked 2nd, 1st, 8th and 3rd. In 80% of seasons he played Montana had the 4th or better scoring defense in the NFL.

Not a crime but he also burned basically every single bridge he had on the way out of town and it's not like people have shied away from calling out big ben for also being a piece of shit. But no.. lets make this a racial issue",nfl

"Agreed with everything except the division statement.

It's weird to stack the AFC East up to the other divisions because the Pats virtually always win (in the Brady era obvs) so it makes the rest of the division look bad, but the Dolphins and Jets have gotten boned by having you guys in the division.  Both start the season with one loss and effectively end up flipping a weighted coin to see who starts with two losses pencilled in.  

And while the Bills have definitely been on the bottom of the totem poll, they have been way better than other teams that have been perennial bottom feeders over the last two decades like the Browns, Rams, and whoever the worst team in the AFC South is.",nfl

Yeah that's what I was thinking as well between the 3 of them. I would think TY has earned the right to be considered in the same tier with them as well even though he is limited physically and height wise but he can be pretty dominate as well. I'm sure a ton of people would also argue to but Devante Adams in their as well but I think you could put Keenan/Thomas/Evans in the top of tier 2 and TY/Adams still in that same tier but not quite in that realm of busting out of tier 2 and budding into tier 1. I think Keenan/Thomas/Evans are all extremely close to breaking into tier 1 where I think it would take some pretty ridiculously crazy production for most fans to argue they can bud into that top tier of WR's in the league but I still by no means would put them in a class behind the aforementioned players. If that all logic somehow makes sense haha,nfl
They still however in my opinion have better wide receivers (Robby Anderson a top deep threat in the league as well as a future top tight end in Chris Herndon now that Gronk is gone) better linebackers with proven guys like CJ Mosley and Avery Williamson.

"That's how I felt initially but it's unfair to blame the defense imo after arguably the greatest defensive performance in Falcons history and them being forced to play so many extra snaps due to Shanahans refusal to call run plays. I got most of this opinion from an article and video I watched that broke down how that affected every other part of the game - IIRC the main issue for the defense was the snap count but mainly the amount of time on the clock from the time they left the field to came back on. So I share that same sentiment, ""tough to blame the curtains for a house fire that was started from a match"" so its hard to blame a defense that was unnecessarily forced to play almost an extra full games worth of snaps after that great performance those defensive players are who I feel the most for outside of Ryan and Julio. Dont think I'll ever forget the shot of Ryan screaming run the ball through the headset at Shanahan

But I also understand how defensive 49ers fans are of Shanahan I would be too if it was my team who nabbed him but all you can really hope is that he learned from it. Just my 2cents but nothing new as theres so much reading material on that game",nfl

That’s a hard no from me

That’s definitely debatable, I could see why you’d give the edge to Moss.

"Again, I think this article is only highlighting the Vikings as the most recent example of the trend they're trying to point out, not saying they specifically need to choose Cousins over Rudolph. Keeping Rudolph probably makes them a better team than rolling with Irv right off the bat, but that's tougher when you're paying a QB top dollar. That's not Cousin's fault, the Vikings fault, or whatever, it's how the league is. 

It's the decision Seattle had to make by paying Russ and cutting back on the LOB, the situation the Packers were in by paying Rodgers and hurting in other spots, the spot the Chiefs will be in when they pay Mahomes. In the other direction, Denver got their SB after they *cut* Manning's money and spent it on defense. 

A top tier QB helps you get to the playoffs more often, but paying a top tier QB like a top tier QB can ultimately keep you from the title.",nfl

"Garbage time, for me, isn't defined by a score or a time. To me, it's defined by when a team that is ""comfortably ahead"" changes its strategy from trying to stop the losing team to allowing the losing team to make progress in exchange for burning time off the clock.

Implications of that definition:

* If the winning team always had this strategy all along, it's nearly impossible to draw a line on when it's garbage time or not.
* ""Comfortably ahead"" is fuzzy on purpose. I'd have to analyze where it ""felt like garbage time"" vs. not in every game to try to hash that out, but I'm guessing it's tied to more than just the score, also the degree of success the losing team has had vs. the winning team's defense -- and time remaining. As others have mentioned, a large lead vs. the Patriots (or Rodgers Packers, or back in my day the Elway Broncos or Montana Niners, etc.) is not safe, so I'd have a hard time calling almost anything garbage time, ... maybe when it's a 2 or 3 score lead with less than 2 minutes to go?

There was a league wide memo in the 90s sent by the commissioner telling teams to stop any players from using PEDs. It wasn't put in the rule book, and there was no mention on how to punish any players caught using it, only that the team was to stop them.

Also, while it's pretty much a know fact that Bonds was taking PEDs, he was never caught. He never failed a test. If he was caught and there was concrete evidence that he was using them then I can understand the position to ban him a bit more. But there was no proof that he was using.

"**Prologue: This is a rant. Dont read it if that's upsetting to you.**

Man, there has been some major revisionist history going on in regards to Bells talent, which I guess is understandable given that he didnt play at all last year. But imo, people who say what you said, did not watch them play. Conner put up *similar* stats, for 4/5 of *one season,* while being spelled by backups. 

**CONNER**

GS: 12

Rush: 215

Yds: 973

Rec Yds: 497

Rec TD: 1

R/G: 4.2

**BELL**

GS: 62

Rush: 1229

**COMPARISON**

Bell has essentially played almost exactly 5x as many games as Conner has. 

In summation, in order for Conner to be considered as effective as Bell imho, he basically has to do in the next 4 years what is on track to take him 4.5 years, assuming he has zero regression, and improves in multiple areas, lol. The only stat hes better than Bell in is rush TDs and Y/A *(by .2, from a 12 game sample size, vs 62)*. 

Bell has a higher total ypg (by 4 yds), higher rush ypg (by 11 yds), a comparable ypc (over 50 more games), higher reception pg (by almost 1), higher rec ypg (by over 4), and a higher catch % (by 2). And, hes doing this while touching the ball 5x more on average, over 5x as long of a time period. 

The real crazy thing to me is that these numbers include Bells slow start in 2017, and his mediocre rookie year. We're talking about a three time pro bowler and two time first team all pro, who is consistently agreed upon as a top 3 back in football, versus a kid who had one good season and a pro bowl. 

In the most absolutely extreme case, the jury is still out. Other end of the spectrum, the comparison is laughable.

**Edit:** this also leaves out the fact that Bell is essentially a WR2 that teams have to account for when hes on the field. Hes an unprecedented weapon, and if Conner has a better year than Bell I'll call my fiancee Daddy in front of her conservative mom and dad.",nfl

"&gt;This is nonsense.

This is naive.

&gt;The circumstances between 2008 and 2009 were entirely different and you can't just decide to shift one narrative to the next year, the MVP is a comprehensive resume and things change. If 2009 Brees was going against 2008 Manning he very obviously would have won MVP.

On paper, the circumstances were the same. Give the MVP to the best player. That was Brees in 2009.

&gt;Brees' receiving corps wasn't substantially worse, he also had a much better offensive line and running game.

And also a better completion percentage, better YPA, better AY/A, better TD%, better INT%, more TDs, fewer INTs, better passer rating...

Jaylon plays MLB, which in this system is 'shallow' LB (closer to line of scrimmage), the 'thumper'. LVE plays the furthest from the line of scrimmage, and is primarily a coverage LB, but is definitely still expected to having closing speed on run plays/screens to the outside.",nfl

"Fun fact:  During the regular season, he was 2nd in the league among receivers (with 40+ touches) in TDs per touch.  He got the ball 47 times and has scored 7 touchdowns; **he scored every 6-7 touches**.  Only Mike Williams did better in that category.  If you include the post receivers with 20+ touches, he drops to 4th, but still better than AB, OBJ, Jones, Thielen, Hill, Diggs, Evans, Hopkins, etc.

I think he was also at the top, or near the top, among receivers in touchdowns per snap, but I can't find the data to validate.",nfl

See we had Dez Bryant who was the only one dropping more than Cooper. He was what I would call inconsistent his last year in Dallas. Cooper hasn’t been that way.

"IMO there are two reasons he isn't higher. First is that in his 23 year career, he missed the playoffs 11 times, including consecutive seasons following back-to-back Super Bowl wins. Second is that despite the franchise being awful before he got there, he had 2 HOF executives helping him put together the team, and if they put scouts in the HOF, Bill Nunn would no doubt be in it. 

As a whole, the Steelers dynasty was great, but the people responsible for it are tough to evaluate. Who do you give more credit to? The MVP QB? The coach that turned the franchise around? The HOF WR duo? One of the greatest defenses ever? The owner that put into place the coach, GM, scouts, etc. that formed the team?

"As always, here are where I ranked the following players, who I think is underrated, overrated, and if you disagree, leave a comment why, hopefully we can get some solid football discussion about these players.

|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Lane Johnson|80|70|\-10|
|Melvin Gordon|79|39|\-40|
|Harrison Smith|78|126+|48+|
|Byron Jones|77|119|42|

|Shaq Mason|75|41|\-34|
|Ryan Ramczyk|74|48|\-26|
|Terron Armstead|73|Small sample size :/|Wouldve been top 25|
|TJ Watt|72|44|\-28|
|Jalen Ramsey|71|123|52|

Lot to unwrap here, only ones I feel pretty comfortable with here are Lane and Odell, who I had slightly betteer.

*Note: I would've ranked Armstead, who I thought was the best tackle when he played in the league, but 10 games was really hard to overlook, and especially at tackle where one bad game can make your season a lot worse, I felt his overall sample size wasn't large enough to rank him on this list.  He was unable to satisfy the 60% snap threshold I generally tried to look at, even when I softened it to 55%.*

# Underrated

**Melvin Gordon -** One of the best RBs in the league last year, I had him graded as my 4th best RB and my 2nd best runner.  He ended up being pretty high for my #4 RB, but the top end talent at RB this year really was amazing in my opinion.  He was running behind a bad offensive line, make no mistake about it.  Rated as PFF's 17th best run blocking unit, they had Okung who was solid to good, and no one else really worth their weight, and Gordon still managed to turn out a dominant run game from there.  As an RB, he was 5th in DYAR, 3rd in DVOA on Football Outsiders.  The overall rushing offense as a whole was ranked 7th among FO's offensive DVOA, as well as YPA.  PFF also shared this opinion, giving Melvin Gordon their highest run grade among RBs, and placing him 3rd among running backs overall.  He was utterly dominant in his best year as a pro, and imo should've been even higher than an already good 79 rank.

**Shaq Mason** \- Moving onto the biggest Pats snub of this entire list (that I know of, rankers don't have access to future rankings besides the ones next week), Mason was quite arguably the best run blocking guard in the entire league, and a good pass protector on top of that.  The best member of the run blocking unit that ranked 2nd in the league as run blockers by both FO's OL metrics and PFF's run blocking grades behind only the Rams, he transformed the Pats offense and allowed it to become one with a fantastic rush offense.  They were top 5 in rushing yards and TDs, top 10 in rushing DVOA, although they did suffer in rushing YPC a bit.  Still, Mason graded out as PFF's best run blocking guard, and best guard overall, and although he wasn't the greatest on either their pass blocking grade or pass blocking efficiency metrics (the two areas that had me push Yanda and Zack Martin over him), he was still a top 3 guard this past season and should've been in the fringe elite range of players.  Also, I believe run blocking as a more important OL trait due to the OL's unbelievable importance to the run game, while their work in the pass game is only a piece of the overall passing offense.

**Ryan Ramczyk -** Have had an OL crush on Ramczyk for 2 years now, and he's proven himself worthy of that this year as well, with another dominant RT performance.  Ramczyk was the OT version of Shaq in a way, although not quite the perfect pass protector, especially when you look at Brees' lightning quick release helping him out and still not faring well either in sacks/hits/hurries given up (still good, just not elite), and definitely not good in pass blocking grade (21st among tackles), he was undoubtedly an elite run blocker.  Not only did PFF grade him as a top 3 run blocker, the success was clear both in the Saints dominant run game with Kamara and Ingram, as well as on film as shown in the film above (particularly fond of the first clip, or what I believe should be the first clip) where Ramczyk shows his ability to turn into a bulldozer moving from the line into space. FO also graded runs towards the right side of the NO line as 5th best in the league, and outside end runs towards the right as 3rd best in the league in their adjusted offensive line yards stat.  Ram was an elite run blocker without question, and a capable pass protector for Brees on top of that, and a top 3 tackle for me this season.  Again, should've been in that fringe elite space, though he got bumped down on my list by some of the other talent there.

**TJ Watt -** Watt had a lot of pass rush volume, with his 13 sacks and 21 QB hits, but that's not the area that made me fall in love with Watt.  His efficiency in that area was good, not great, and not particularly eye popping like guys like Ford, Mack, Clark, Hunter, Houston, Hughes.  What popped out to me was the incredible run defense ability, and the ability to go beyond traditional run defense, and force an incredible 6 fumbles on the year.  That's approaching a forced fumble every 2 games which is insane.  He was able to consistently put stops to the run game, with the 3rd highest rate among all edge defenders behind only Campbell and DLaw, and that combined with his forced fumble ability superceded his low TFLs and PFF run grade, and placed him as a top 5 run defender for me.  His ability to rush the passer at still a good extent is what got him his deserved placing, and although I think I may have been a little too high on him, 72 is still a little too low imo.

**overrated in the comment below, exceeded character limit**",nfl
"I think there is a reason why he is never in discussion for a top safety, or every ever an honorable mention. He has few big plays, no explosive hits, he is just a good positional player. Look it up, ask anyone. Tackles don’t justify him being elite.

"There is a very little talked about issue with Carr especially on deep balls. Cooper didn’t have any issue catching from Dak but he routinely struggled downfield with Carr. Now some of that was assigned blame to Cooper but many times, he had to make massive adjustments on the route just to get to where it could be a drop instead of a wild miss. Then other times there was no touch on the ball so it bounced of wildly, and that’s been an issue for Carr. He has a cannon but he threw to Cook on every play because it was a short pass and he has big strong TE hands that have to block as opposed to receiver hands. I’m not sure AB is going to love catching balls from Carr.",nfl

"Currently 0. In 10-20 years? Maybe. The great experiment that is the current Browns rebuild is going to be the standard for if tanking will become practice. If the Browns are consistently 11 wins a season and making the playoffs, but out first or second round, tanking won’t take place as a viable strategy. This is because it’s pretty easy to take a 5-11 roster and turn them into a 9-7 roster the next year. We see this seemingly every single season in the nfl. Now if the Browns rebuild results in 2-3 Super Bowls before they have to pay anyone, then this will be the methodology some of those teams start adopting. If this methodology does work then I could see in 10-20 years tanking to be a problem, especially if the rookie wage scale stays the same in reference to the current CBA. One other surefire way to prevent tanking is to remove the rookie wage scale as before paying Sam Bradford $60M hurt you way more than Baker Mayfeilds $30M.",nfl

Once November rolled around most everyone knew Bowles wasn’t going to be retained (including TB, who was rumored to have been making overtures with Bruce Arians to join his staff if he were to land another HC gig).

Coaching: Bills, McDermott has done a great job getting his players to buy into team culture and coaching them up. Gase has done the opposite.

Offensive line: The Bills have a slight advantage cause the Mitch Morse signing plus drafting Cody Ford. The Jets meanwhile have gone with the “what even is a center” approach. 

Rush Defense: I’m just gonna call this one a draw cause both teams spend their 1sts on DTs

Passing Defense: Bills without question. The Bills had the best pass defense in the league last year the McDermott can work wonders with DBs. Just last season he turned Levi Wallace (who was undrafted) into PFFs highest graded rookie corner.

The irony in his situation that got him cut last year was that the more out of line he was getting, trashing the coaching staff and shit, the worse his performance was. He was missing tackles and struggling to cover.

Having that in mind, he would be best suited to go to a team that doesn't have a ton of money tied up in skill players. Sure, Brady to Odell would be sick, but with that much money tied up on offence your defence is suffering, and you aren't really taking advantage of having Brady.

That being said, I think if the right suitor comes along (team with nobodies at the skill position, missing a QB, but with a stout defence) he could get $50-$60 mil per, especially if he's taking one or two year ""mercenary"" deals ala Revis, so that teams could compete with him for a couple years then enter rebuild mode when all the contracts expire

Oh yea, this is also assuming Brady is in his prime. I think now he'd get much less, but still $35-40 million",nfl

Is he great? Nope, at least he hasn't been. Has he shown that he can be in the good to very good class? Yup, at times. Has he been put in an above-average situation where he can play to his full potential all season long? I certainly don't think so.

"&gt;Would this person exceed the achievements of those who were not their contemporaries? This is the debate, I don't think BB would have done significantly better than a few people on that list.

This question confused me a bit; is it asking if Belichick has exceeded the accomplishments of people who weren't his contemporaries, or would he do so in some hypothetical scenario?

If it's the former, I'd argue he's already exceeded both Lombardi and Walsh by a notable margin. Belichick has won as many titles as Lombardi despite having twice the number of teams in the league for four of those, and did so during a time with free agency and the salary cap. And Belichick's doubled up Walsh in terms of championships, tripled him in terms of SBs reached, and again, did so in the current free agent area. I don't see much of an argument for their accomplishments over Belichick's.

If it's some hypothetical scenario, then maybe there's an argument to be made (i.e. how well would Lombardi do if he coached in the 21st century?), but quite honestly that just feels like a rather pointless debate since the ""what if"" scenario can go all day long with no real way of knowing.

I'd argue the one guy with a legit claim to be made for GOAT coach over Belichick is Paul Brown, who had an absurd amount of success even taking into account time differences, and basically invented modern football. Lombardi and Walsh are much tougher arguments imo.",nfl

&gt;Next would be you could (at least I would) make arguments for 2008, 2009, 2017, and even 2018 where he could have been at least a 2nd team AP

This is a whole other argument but I strongly disagree, the only one of those years I can really see anybody arguing well is 08. That would give Rivers one year compared to Fouts' 4 (and Fouts had one or two other years as well that could be argued he was at/near the top).

It seems that the crux of your argument is that Rivers really did have a few years in which he deserved all pro but the bias of the voters prevented him from receiving it. I think the only year in which you could adequately make this case is 08 (09 if all you do is look at stats, and I'm seriously unsure of how the hell you could argue 17 or 18 because he's outclassed in every way by at least two guys both of those years).",nfl

&gt; Before the Super Bowl, he watched an episode of Peyton Manning’s Detail series on ESPN-Plus on Goff, and it hit him right away—the offense is the same. Looking at the Rams tape confirmed it. Then, he saw an NFL Network interview where Goff and McVay discussed the coach being in the quarterback’s ear up until the 15-second play-clock cutoff, which was something Shanahan did with Hoyer. Then, Hoyer went back to Amazon’s All or Nothing series on the Rams; it was about the 2016 season but had footage of OTAs from McVay’s first spring there. Hoyer recognized the language.",nfl
"Some things to keep in mind:

Nebraska scores more points in the first 3 games (191) than its opponents did all year (174).

Nebraska played 4 teams who ended the season in the top 10 and won by an average of 30.8 points.

If Nebraska scored ZERO second half points all year they still would have won all but one game.

Kansas State (#7) would finish 2nd in scoring defense that year giving up 145 total points. Nebraska scores 49 of those 145 (33.8%).

Edit: Miami needed to pull out a couple close games where as Nebraska only had 1 team within two TDs in the second half (20-7 Washington St at halftime). Nebraska’s offense would have had problems with the defensive speed of Miami. Miami’s offensive line didn’t see anything like Nebraska’s front 7 in 2001. Talent edge: Miami. Coaching edge: Nebraska. It would be a fun game to watch that’s for sure...",nfl

"It's Cam's team. We've built our offense around Cam's skill. Absolutely nobody in the organization is eyeing a backdoor to Cam if he's healthy.

Cam's injury last year was not a big deal. He had bone spur and scar tissue from the procedure he had in 2017, and as he continued to play on it, the irritants caused swelling and inflammation. The reason he had to keep playing on it was that we as a team got off to a 6-2 start, and we felt more comfortable with 70% of Cam Newton (and then eventually about 50% of Cam Newton) than we did 100% of Taylor Heniecke. And because of that, the swelling grew and the injury got worse when a week or two of rest could have extended his season.

You need a new backup when that's the case. This was not about drafting Cam's replacement or creating a controversy, or even about getting a guy who can play a whole year in Cam's absence. This was about having *literally anything* worth putting on the field if he has to miss 2-4 games.

Also

&gt; Cam is a black guy and Grier is a white guy. And, you know, race often ends up becoming a wee bit of a factor these days in politics, society and everything else, including with quarterbacks. Especially with quarterbacks.

Your question (rhetorical or otherwise) about not hearing about the meat based estrogens he espoused as a study put forth by a quack of a doctor similar to the antivax guy as well as a meat conglomerate wanting to suppress the competition (not unrealistic). 

Essentially his argument against meat based estrogens is A) it's absorbable, B) it's pumped full of estrogen based growth hormones to increase sale volumes/profitability, C) even natural grass fed meat would still have some level of estrogen greater than plants because it typically comes from female cows that are perpetually cycling.

Also, one good coach, Tomlin, vs. the revolving door and playbook in San Diego.  I would also give the Steelers O line higher marks most seasons.  Rivers has played less games because he was backing up Drew Brees for a couple of seasons, but thrown a better TD to INT %, higher completion %, and has a better passer rating than Roethlisberger.  I think both QBs are a step up from Manning, and either would probably have roughly equal success had their teams been swapped.",nfl

That team was perpetually in 3rd and long because Barry would get stuffed trying to dance around and make a big play instead of taking what he got and getting 2-3 yards. The idea that Barry Sanders was as much a liability as not may shock redditors but it was a known quantity when he played because you could see it happening every Sunday.",nfl
"&gt; Imo the driving force behind the NFL coming down hard on the Pats was because of intense public backlash rather than some kind of personal vendetta.

I mean, a high-ranking league employee who just happened to have worked for the Jets for 20 years sought out a Patriots equipment manager during the game and told him that NE was ""in big fucking trouble"" 

It's just silly to say that there was no personal vendetta involved if you're aware of Mike Kensil's role in the whole thing.",nfl

I also don’t really know how to compare the performance of a 5th best guard to the 6th best QB etc. It seems so removed from reality that it loses any meaning. Is the best full back better than the 2nd best QB? What about an all world blocking TE?

"&gt; If Joe Flacco is a mediocre QB, and as you postulated Lamar Jackson is incapable of running the passing portion of the offense designed specifically for Flacco, would this mean that Lamar Jackson has a sub-mediocre throwing talent? 

No, because this equates all passing offenses as being the same.  They're not.  Joe has a limited passing game.  The throws he's good at are not the throws that Lamar is good at.

Additionally, Lamar had zero time prior to Joe's injury with the first team offense.  Most of Joe's game is based around a west coast offense, which emphasizes a lot of short timing routes.  Without time to work with your receivers, none of that timing gels.",nfl
"Ireland here: Seahawks because they threw on the one yard line.

No,seriously.

I'd watched every Super Bowl since XLVI (2012: Giants v Patriots), always cheering for the underdog. Super Bowl XLVIII (2014: Seahawks v Broncos) was the most impressive display of football I'd ever seen. The following year I was in a bind: support the reigning champs or support the most dominant team of that era (Patriots). Found myself rooting for the Seahawks. I soon discovered that I remembered some names, particularly Marshawn Lynch, who was thrilling to watch (and has an Irish surname). AND the LOB was the first defensive unit I could get excited about.

Eventually, Kearse made his heroic circus catch and it looked like the Seahawks were destined for a repeat. Then Butler happened and I was inexplicably crushed. 

This was only the fourth NFL game I'd ever watched, I'd never been to Seattle, didn't actually know where it was and didn't know anything about the place or the franchise. The result shouldn't have mattered to me, but it did. That fact made it clear that this was my team, and no amount of logic could convince me otherwise.

"We were definitely way more excited about Hue because he was widely considered the top candidate at the time and the Browns rarely land the top candidate. Our reaction to Kitchens is more like: ""This choice is logical and I believe that he has the tools to be successful even though other fans won't look past his lack of coordinating experience."" Most of our current excitement is because of Baker and the amount of talent that we have on our roster in general.    

This isn't directed towards you, but its interesting how you only hear about Kitchen's coordinator experience and never about his total NFL experience or his experienced assistants. Those two factors make me feel a lot better about his lack of coordinating experience (The proper amount of coordinating experience before someone is ready for a HC job seems arbitrarily defined but that's another argument for another day)

And you’re right about a percent not always being the average. In the case of looking at completion percent, which is what I meant when I said that (but wasn’t explicitly clear when declaring that, so that’s my bad), both would be the same. That’s definitely on me.

"The reason steroids are so effective for injury prevention and recovery is that they make you stronger and you don't have to work as hard for the same result.

Steroids don't make you jacked, and I don't think the vast majority of people *actually* think this.

They just make you more jacked all else equal, which I think most people intuitively know.

Note: I said steroids because steroids are the most effective class of PED. There are some anabolic substances that are technically not steroids, but attempt to mimic the actions of steroids. There are PEDs that carry terrible risk/reward ratios that people will bring up, but they are not really worth it.

John Wick pledging a life long allegiance to the high table seems like it negates Wick's feelings in the second movie and the whole reason he ultimately killed Santino. That said, I do absolutely love the world building which I think makes the movies so exciting to follow.

&gt;!The only other issue, and this one minor, is at times the fighting felt too fan servicey. JW3 really amped up the action and the first 30 or so minutes were phenomenal.

"Backstory: Me and my gf bought a house with her moms (they're gay) almost 2 years ago so we live together with their other kids (12yo + 13yo). It's been great so far, but every now and then we have some weird shit happen. My gf also recently made a new friend that we play board games with weekly.

So on Thursday we get a text from her moms asking for a family meeting. They're usually pretty benign things like figuring out how to split the utility bills or who should mow the lawn this week yadda yadda, but this one caught us off guard

Mom1: ""So, uh, this is super awkward, and I don't really know how to ask this, so, uh, are you guys having any ""visitors of the night""?""

Us: ""Uh, what?""

Mom2: ""Oh stop beating around the bush and ask them already""

Mom1: ""Ok, fine. Are you guys having threesomes with [new friend]?""

Us: ""lmao wtf""

Mom2: ""We don't care if you are. You're adults and your lovelife is entirely up to you, but your bedroom is directly below our 13yo son so we'd appreciate it if you had your threesomes elsewhere""

Us: ""We're not having threesomes lol (i wish tho, she's a hottie), what makes you think we are? Has he heard us having sex?""

Mom1: ""No, but we've heard the backdoor opening late at night""

Me: ""When? I was up til 1am last night and no one came in or out""

Mom2: ""It's been a while, I think the last time was about 3-4 weeks ago?""

So basically they heard our backdoor (we're the only ones with access to it) open late at night a couple times and assumed that meant we were having orgies. The truth is we were probably taking out the trash or grabbing something from our cars, but it's nice to know that at least someone out there thinks I have enough game to pull multiple hotties.

Take those two off the team and let’s see how the defense would do even with a great coordinator. 

Talent is most important and they are returning 9 of 11 starters including 4 all pros + Roquan Smith. Last time I checked Mack Jackson Hicks and Fuller (all all pro) were still on the defense. Underrated studs like Eddie Goldman and Roquan are returning as well. Chuck Pagano ain’t no scrub either.

It’s fine to think the Bears might do worse but if so it will be because Trubisky plays pathetically and gets worse or the offensive line doesn’t perform well and can’t block. The defense will again be one of, if not the best in the league and the clear strength of the team. Talent wins.",nfl

"I met Joe Thomas when I was in high school. Would've been about 7 or 8 years ago, so he was already firmly established as one of the best, if not the best, LTs in the league.

I'm from a small town that's kinda up-north-ish in Wisconsin. Every summer, Joe would go to his ""cabin"" (i.e. 2nd house) up north for a week. Since there aren't really many gyms around, Joe would work out in my high school's weight room while he was on vacation. We all knew that it happened every summer, but never knew what week it would be. He and my football coach would keep it hush-hush so Joe wasn't bothered by anyone. 

One day I showed up to the weight room about 45 minutes later than usual, and because of that, my workout would go longer than usual too. Asked coach if he could keep it open a little later, and he said, ""sure, I've gotta hang out here anyway."" So about halfway through my workout, this big ol' fucking bearded stallion comes walking in. I knew I recognized him right away, but couldn't place his face. Took me about 5 minutes of watching him talk to my coach before I realized it was Joe Thomas.

He starts working out. Did about 15 minutes of 5lb shoulder labrum and rotator cuff exercises before he touched anything else. Then he starts to bench. My God. He repped out I-don't-know-how-many reps of 135lbs for his warmup. Then he adds another plate on each side and chains. So he's doing 225lbs with chains (probably 315lbs at the top, but lighter at the bottom due to resting chain links). And he reps that shit out like it's nothing for like 4 or 5 sets.

By that point, I was finished up with my workout. He gave me a few tips and pointers, and I went on my way. The next day, I went in at my regular time, but he was early, so our workouts overlapped more. I don't remember how much he did, but I remember being blown away by his squats, plus he used chains again. Then, this 320lb hunk of a man proceeds to go outside, put on a parachute and proceed to run sprints on the hill for like an hour straight, in like 90+ degree heat.

Those two days made me pretty confident that I probably wasn't going to be an NFL player.

Also met Jim Leonhard once. I played sports against his brother. His calves look like an athletic person's thighs. They're massive. He was listed at 5'8"", and I can tell you that's pretty generous. 

Both dudes were super nice guys.",nfl
"&gt;The official strike zone is the area over home plate from the midpoint between a batter's shoulders and the top of the uniform pants -- when the batter is in his stance and prepared to swing at a pitched ball -- and a point just below the kneecap. In order to get a strike call, part of the ball must cross over part of home plate while in the aforementioned area.

Subjective.",nfl
"Even most Packers fans don't call Aaron the GOAT. Talent wise you could argue for that. I'm definitely biased, but I've watched a lot of football in my life and never have I seen someone with the talent level of Aaron Rodgers at QB. Yes, Brady is more accomplished. Yes, Manning and Brees have had more sustained success. But NO ONE can put the ball on a dime like Aaron does. He's a hell of a lot more mobile than Brady, Manning, and Brees too. Albeit he is incredibly injury prone, which is frustrating, but he has everything you'd want in a QB.

If you take the top 20 most impressive throws of the last decade, Aaron probably has close to half of them. No Packer fan has ever taken an L and felt like Aaron didn't do enough. You can call him high maintenance, a smug douche bag, whatever, but that motherfucker is as tough as they come.

I can't even acknowledge OP bringing up Mahomes. That's just ridiculous. Must be a millennial",nfl

"Definitely not your imagination.

My theory is that there's a sort of Brady post threshold that must always be met because people find him/the GOAT QB question interesting.

Early in the offseason this sub was basically r/bradyfacts. That burned itself out after a while and then we went into a Rodgers/Brady phase, albeit a weaker one than many of the past Rodgers/Brady wars. As that inevitably died down Manning/Brady has risen to fill its place for... some reason.

But more or less I think you just need a) a shortage of Brady topics that haven't recently burned themselves out and b) one or two key posts on a particular Brady angle than then get other people thinking about that angle, leading them to make more posts on that angle.",nfl

My dad says at the time not too many people knew too much about steroids and how much of a difference they made and what not.

"Fair enough re: the guy you were replying to and the context of your comments.

But my point (which, note, I framed as ""*another* comparison"") still stands regarding the rankings and the rankers: his stats in 2014 and 2018 *were* pretty similar and his ANY/A was higher than in 2014 even *after* era adjustment. His playoff run was similarly impressive to 2014 (I think a lot of rankers were underrating Brady's three-game 2018 playoff performance because of the low passing TD number and because of a difficult SB against a Wade Phillips defense).

You could certainly put 2014 above 2018 but the two seasons are in the same general ballpark in terms of quality and impressiveness, I think.

Leaving him off a top 100 in 2014 would have been viewed as sheer lunacy. Of course, the same is true in 2018 for just about everybody other than the r/nfl rankers.",nfl

I don't want a single great season with a run at a ring. I want SF to be back to an annual contender. I think that takes time, and that Lynch and Shanahan are going in the right direction. The point is continued success, that comes from having a core group of players, the right mind set and a front office that works together. The 49ers have lacked those traits for what seems like decades now. Long-standing fans should want the 49ers from the 80's and 90's vs. the Harbaugh years as the later can fizzle out faster than the legion of whom.",nfl

Multiple INTs, cant move the ball worth a damn, and its because hes missing throws. Was a Bills game I wanna say somewhere in there where he had like 4 INTs. Or his game against the Ravens in the '11 playoffs. It's so weird because he doesn't really do that anymore. After probably 2012 or 2013, he just stopped. Even now when he's against a team he is struggling with (like the 09/10 Jets, or the 09-12 ravens) it's stull a solid game, it might not be good or pretty but it was respectable, like his '16 game against the Broncos where he threw for sub 200 and no TDs.

Edit: And from the audio and Brady's hand motion at the end of the play it makes me believe they had a timeout as it appears Brady is calling for one near the end.",nfl
"It's interesting to watch the 2020 D hopefuls in this hearing, trying to jockey for position and grandstand a bit in taking on Barr. Klobuchar has done a pretty awful job, asking questions that are showy and suggestive but that Barr is pretty clearly going to give answers in the negative to. I didn't see Booker's, heard it wasn't great however, but Harris' was very impressive to me. No pomp and circumstance, just an absolute, meticulous grilling from a tenured litigator. She was excellent.",nfl
"Interesting. I wonder if the same was true in the earlier rounds. The Cowboys went up against them first and lost. Probably because Cowboy fans are one of the universally least liked fans in the league maybe behind the Pats. We were voting against 31 other teams. The fact that they made it into the final round was due more to trolls than to actual fans of the team unless they were buying votes all the way through. 

I think the Bills beat their competition fair and square because everyone recognized the Bills Mafia is fucking diehard.",nfl
NBA 2k used to be a great game on top of being very cheap for some reason (29.99 on release where I'm from). But they then gradually upped and matched the price of EA games and also added tonnes of in game purchases. It's better than nothing but sucks they just copied a shitty business model when they realized they owned the market.,nfl

You decide who’s better.

Yes Peyton has all the stats and accolades but Brady has the rings and better W-L record, I believe Peyton just edges based on the individual success and that Brady is still killing it in this decade and that his most memorable moment came in the 2010s..

Your stats seem to back this argument as well",nfl
"seriously. him &amp; his girlfriend are so evidently immature it's almost cartoonish. that still falls back on his character for going back to her again &amp; again after knowing she's the type to go psycho, lie &amp; get him in trouble, but everyone totally ignores any proof of that because of the agenda at hand.

domestic violence makes me sick to my stomach, but crazy people that exploit it as leverage are just as bad.",nfl
"Fully recovered from a 15 hour flight (AKL - ORD) and on a farmlet owned by my partner's best friend of 30 years. I'm slowly getting used to the scale of America again.

Man, this feels good.",nfl
"I agree that a coaching staff change can’t just improve an entire unit overnight (looking at you, Chiefs fans) but its really not ludicrous to say DEN is better up front than OAK is. I can’t even count on one hand how many times last year you guys got straight up mauled in the trenches even without injuries.",nfl
I dont agree with the wentz healthy narrative. Dude tore his ACL after taking huge hits (stupid mistakes that a vet QB wouldnt make). Its almost a given that a year after your ACL tear is poor. I think wentz will come back this year just like the year he was hurt. He probably wont be as risky butnhe will be a good QB.,nfl
"The defense was complete trash last year, which is murder on your PFF rankings. That's why I don't like PFF claiming they are measuring individual play, if the defense is successful this year then a bunch of those guys could jump into the 80s, like Kendall Fuller for example. He's obviously talented but everybody got bad grades last year because our defensive coaching was atrocious, and the defense was very rarely successful.",nfl
People are acting like anyone actually wanted him to play TE. More than likely it was just to gauge his response to a question like that. Teams ask guys weird shit all the time to see how they handle it. More of a character analysis than anything on the field.,nfl
This is the correct answer. He wasn’t good enough to be a starter in the league because defenses found him out. He was good enough to be a backup and still be in the league but at the end of the day the NFL is a business and no owner wanted to deal with the publicity that came from signing Kapernick when there are a million other replacement level QBs out there,nfl
"Okay, and what about Baker wasn't outstanding? Breaking the rookie TD record in 13 games? Leading the 2nd most productive 2nd half of the season of any team ever? Leading the same number of game-winning drives (4) as his team had *wins* in 3 seasons before that?

Like you said they both deserved it, but Baker Mayfield had the 1st or 2nd best rookie QB season in 30+ years. Saquon Barkley had an amazing rookie season, especially when looking at gross totals instead of efficiency or value. But his rushing production was first by a pretty small margin over Nick Chubb thanks to more use in the first 6 games of the season, and his gross receiving yardage was a product of being forced an absurd number of targets.",nfl
I think the biggest argument stats wise is probably his touchdowns. I believe that he has the most on the last 3 years at 35. There are of course other things that you can look at like his release game and his route running which are both elite and there would even be some who would say that Adams has the best release game in the league although I wouldn't say I'm enough off an expert to make that claim.,nfl
"I think we are setting up nicely to contend again in a year or two though. This year’s squad is going to be super young outside of Russ, the starting LB’s, and some OL. There will be growing pains and there is still a youth movement to come at OL as there has been at other positions. The WR group could be awesome as soon as early next year, and while RBs are fickle at best I feel we are pretty well set there for a while, and the secondary should take another step this year and be even better next year with some of this new class making the Sophomore jump. I feel great about this team at QB/RB/WR/LB/S for the long run and good-not-great at TE/CB/DL. Really just leaves the OL with longer-term questions, but I like Solari so there is some optimism there.",nfl
"Are you high? I said it's based on PERFORMANCE. He had a bad super bowl. He had an okay playoff performance but I'm not bumping a guy up 7 spots on my QB rankings because he had an okay round 1 and 2, and a bad round 3 in the playoffs. I haven't switched my opinion on anything, you're the guy still not accepting that the methodology hasn't changed. You're acting like ya boy threw for 5 TDs and 400 yds this year. That was last year, did you forget that this is only based on 2018 stats too? Why do you care so much either? If you don't like the methodology, you can just say that and leave it alone lol. It's getting really sad all these Patriot fans blowing up my DMs with threats and shit because yall can't accept the fact that Brady had a down year this year.",nfl
"Cheddar’s the chain?  That’s on the same scale as a Cheesecake Factory.  Anything they make there I can do just as good a job or better.  Makes no sense to go there for a meal unless you have a particular craving only they can fill.  

I think the only kind of restaurant experience you should pay for is a 5 or 7 course because that’s about an experience in addition to the food.",nfl
You need a cost-efficient QB. Peyton Manning was cost-efficient on any salary because he was Peyton Fucking Manning. A mediocre QB can be cost-efficient on a cheap contract because the extra cap space can be used on other parts of the roster. What you cannot have is a mediocre QB on a monster contract.  That will tank any chance you have of competing with cost-efficient rosters.,nfl
"I'm just saying, Edelman has just played in double the playoff games as Welker due to the Pats being better during this period in the postseason.  If you prorate their game, Welker just has 40 less receiving yards over a total 18 games (a negligible 2 yards per game), and Welker would have 8 TDs to Jules' 5 (I hate using TDs though).  Edelman has a higher Y/TGT, but that just talks about the kind of receiver they are.  Pats fans just have Welker's drop burned into their head, and Edelman just got a chance to win SB MVP, so everyone thinks Jules over Welker in the postseason when it's definitely not that clear cut, and Welker is, by far, the better wide receiver overall",nfl
"For the title of ""third best playoff QB of all time""?

It's not exactly a huge ask. The idea of having your pick of *any NFL QB ever other than Brady or Montana* and picking a guy with two first round playoff wins should be pretty obvious lunacy.

Hell, I'd take *Flacco* over Eli in a playoff QB argument. The only thing that even keeps Eli in the discussion is that Flacco didn't manage a 2nd QB win.",nfl

"Crazy thing, this was all predicted when the deal was made with Madden. I was a diehard Madden fan from like 96-2004. Bought it every single year.

But man when 2k5 was released for $20, I gave it a go. I really enjoyed it. EA definitely was shook and signed exclusivity rights the next season I believe. I think I went back to Madden, saw diminishing returns. Eventually gave up and got super into NCAA... until that was cancelled. NCAA 14 ended up being the last football video game I've purchased.

Tried to play Madden once since then and it just felt like NOTHING has improved since I last played in like 2008.",nfl
"How else should I group (easily, sortable, so I can post a screen shot) the top few in a given season? 

I mean the best WR in a season has to at least be in the top 5 or so in yardage, right? You couldn't possible tell me the guy that has 1100 yards has a shot at that title.",nfl
"If you’re telling me he needed 6 months to realize that calling out your teammates in a public fashion rather than bring it up to them privately so they could work it out without getting the peanut gallery involved, all while that same peanut gallery has been talking about how that probably wasn’t the best move as a man and the leader of a group of men then I guess that’s how you see it.

"Yeah in retrospect a lot of teams would be fucked without their starting QB. LAR, NE NO MIA and ATL are some of the only ones I can think of off the top of my head who wouldn't completely implode (Bortles, Hoyer, Bridgewater, Rosen and Schaub being the backups, and that's if Rosen doesn't beat Fitz in MIA).

Mad respect to Wilson. Consistently been around top 5 for several years now",nfl
"Wesley Walls was once our most popular player and he took pay cuts to remain on the team. I didn't want to mention his name because he deserves to be in the Ring of Honor.

I just feel like other players should have been in this class. Maybe Mike Minter, Chris Gamble, Michael Bates, or John Kasay would have been among my decisions, at least for this year.",nfl
"Kicker is understandable. But trubs has shown that he is at the very least a serviceable starter and at best an elite athlete. He has shown some questionable Decision making, but people also have to take into account that he was in the first year of a complex passing offense. And his leading td receiver was a rookie wr. So it’s fair to expect an increase in production from him on an already solid 2018 campaign.",nfl
"Lmao why are you telling me about why Rodgers is ranked? I didn't rank Rodgers in the top 100, nor would I have in the top 125 (Brady was my 109) and I was pretty set on Brady &gt; Rodgers.  I literally agree with what you're saying lmao.  Although you haven't accounted for the difference between Rodgers supporting cast vs Brady's, I'd say that although it makes the gap closer, it doesn't account for it completely.  Also although you've posted a nice summary there, there is more that goes into our rankings.",nfl
"Yeah... I mean I wouldn't tell the media I'm a snitch either, I still wanna excel at my job when it comes down to it.  I don't see why it's surprising, players get traded all the time and play against old teams.  It's not like they're stealing full playbooks on their way out of the building and handing it over, but honestly it'd be a disservice to their new team if a coach was going over some play and they knew something and didn't say ""no we don't want to rush &lt;x&gt; at &lt;y&gt; position because they will counter us"".  That's just how competition works, as far as I can tell the NFL doesn't have non-compete clauses in their contracts.",nfl
"He played behind Dwight Freeney and Robert Mathis, for one thing. He wasn't ""a massive bust and a waste of a first round pick.""

"It's fine/right to take issue with quota filling when the objectively best person doesn't get hired as a result ...

But part of the reason quotas have to be instituted in the first place is the nature of a system to sustain itself in a traditional/inbred fashion kind of largely based on echo chambers and confirmation biases.

Squat day with romanian deadlifts, leg press, leg curl, abbductor and farmer's walk.


I use 5/3/1's percentages which work from light to heavy on a weekly basis, with a max rep set. Then I do back off sets until I equal or beat the total number of reps in the max rep set. Do 3 weeks, take an easy week, up the weights, start again.  

Assistance I'm doing a pretty basic double progression; pick something I can do 4x8 with and work to 4x12-15, then up the weight again. Facepulls and tricep extension are just done for pretty high reps for a bit of a pump, ditto the zottman curls). just kinda string 'em all together.",nfl

"Teams in the NFL don't really tank.

The Lottery encourages teams to tank, because instead of having to tank to the worst record in the league they instead only need to tank to an arbitrary ""worst grouping"" instead, meaning there are more spots open to tank to.

The NBA and NFL draft talent is considerably different.  After the first few picks, the draft doesn't usually matter as much.  In the NFL, talent can be found very deep.  This is because 5 starters and ~14 players on roster vs 22 starters and a 53 man roster.",nfl

"&gt; Gore has never been anything more than a borderline top 5 RB at best at any point in his career.

It's really easy to believe this when you treat every season as its own self-contained little data point by making player careers entirely award-centric, but when you look at players holistically it's really hard to argue that Gore was anything less than the 3rd or 4th best RB in the NFL from '06-'12. LT and AP clearly were better up through '09. Shady and Jamaal Charles from '09-'12. In between there were plenty of guys who put up better seasons once, twice, even 3 times, but who were absolutely not better RBs: MJD, Michael Turner, Brian Westbrook, Chris Johnson, Larry Johnson, Alfred Morris, Deangelo Williams, Clinton Portis, Doug Martin, Thomas Jones, etc. are all names of guys you could argue over Gore in one or two seasons, but you'd be daft to say they were better in any way that wasn't purely statistics and purely based on one/two seasons head to head.  
  
It's serious forest/trees stuff when it comes to Gore. Forget that he's always been extremely well rounded and one of the best pass protecting RBs in the NFL, even statistically people have a tendency to definitively say a player who put up 400 more yards and a couple extra TDs in one or two years while missing half of 3/4 seasons was better than a guy who consistently produced slightly below that and never put up a dud season after earning a starting job.",nfl

"[One of my favourite Reed-Manning plays](https://youtu.be/_CDpt1_k9E8?t=5870) (1:37:50 for those on mobile).

If you watch the replay Ed kept his toes in bounds and managed to lateral the ball back to Chris McAlister but the refs called it early. He always treated INTs as a scoring opportunity, and it would have been huge in that game considering how abysmal our offense was (we held prime Peyton to just field goals and still lost).",nfl
"The current NFL scheduling algorithm is perfect.  18 games would just be weird.  Two extra games from where is the question.  Can't just pull them out of a hat, it needs to be an algorithm.  Can't be in division games because you'd need 3 for that for fairness.  It can't be adding another entire division vs division matchup either, that'd require 3 for same conference or 4 for a cross conference. 

I'm definitely in the minority here but the current marijuana policy is fair so long as it remains a federal schedule 1 drug.  The NFL's substances of abuse policy is written in such a way that you only need to pass a drug test once a year, usually the first team activities.  That is unless you're in the intervention program because you're a fuck up.  Use your CBD during the pre-season and season, clean up before your test in late spring.  Chris Long's a great example of working the system, never once failing the annual substances of abuse test.",nfl
"The obvious problems with this method were:
1) Poor definition.  If you want to rank players in a way that's agnostic to the positional values, you might end up with the best waterboy in the league #1 because they're 5 standard deviations better than all the other waterboys.  That's fine if you like, but then the list is utterly inconsistent with everyone's perception of value. 

2) Letting rankers collaborate and discuss. What's the point of 51 ostensibly independent rankers if they can bully pulpit each other and influence each other's votes?

legit this. the fact people are consistently saying them without any mention of another starter like Mariota is also baffling.

"Yep. Even the best teams in the league at third down conversions only convert third and 'manageable' at a 50% rate. It's why a run heavy offence, which normally plays specifically to get to third and short, is usually inconsistent.

Actually think about this. What sucks more: knowing you have no shot at getting a job you want because you're probably not going to get an interview, but having the ""pride"" that you're not being used or knowing that they're only interviewing you because they have to, but you actually have a nonzero chance of getting the job?",nfl
"It's completely different to a HC tho. At the end of a HC's season you know whether it's been a success or not and you can make your decision accordingly. After the draft you have no idea about whether that draft class is successful or not, so you are firing based on poor previous performance. If you dislike the GM's previous performance so much you want to fire him, why would you let him take charge of another draft and FA?",nfl

"Every single DPOY for 15+ years that has those numbers has been well above average, and all five of the best pass rushers of the past decade are legitimate freaks who are several standard deviations above the norm in those areas.

No, it's like hearing someone say ""Most of the best players in NFL history were average at best athletes."" and then providing them with a list of every single DPOY with relevant information and pointing out how they're elite athletes, and pointing out how all the best pass rushers in the NFL are elite athletes.

Yes, you can demand an economically unfeasible sample size to prove you wrong, knowing there aren't 50 1st team all-pros each year. But since 2014 the only 1st team all-pro at a pass rushing position who is below average in 3-cone and 10-split is Damon Harrison who was 32 pounds heavier than average. Marcel Dareus was below average in 3 cone and well above average in 10 split, and Kyle Williams, Elvis Dumervil, and Cameron Heyward do not have info.

2014: 7/10 against your assertion, 2/10 without numbers, 1/10 is Marcel Dareus

2015: 6/6 against your assertion

2016: 5/6 against your assertion, 1/6 is Harrison.

2017: 5/6 against your assertion, 1/6 without numbers.

2018: 5/5 against your assertion

So 28/33 of 1st team all pro pass rushers over the past 5 years have had been well above average combination of 10-split and 3-cone, 3 of them do not have complete info, 1 is better than average when averaging the percentiles, and the other is a complete weight outlier. Of course there are repeats, but all of the repeats are elite, freakish athletes. 

At the end of the day, this all started because Mack and Donald were infinitely better college players and also were better athletes with also better numbers and went later than Clowney.

"Pro Bowls are not a definitive way to grade OL at all, especially when you're trying to grade an entire unit, believe me I've been down that path.  Brady's OL last year got 0 Pro Bowls despite being a top 5 unit in the league, and having the best interior line in the entire league with Shaq Mason/Joe Thuney/David Andrews.  Brady has had guys like Light, Solder, Mankins anchor down long stretches of solid to great O-lines.  Brady has had an O-line coach for almost his whole career who people have legitimately said is a HoF caliber position coach in Scarnecchia.  Where's the equivalent for Montana again?

For receivers, Montana had 8 to Brady's 11, and Montana had much fewer WR1 seasons that weren't Pro Bowl caliber.  When he was with the Chiefs for 2 years he had nobodies, and Dwight Clark after his 2 initial Pro Bowl years was just a standard WR1.  Brady has had a standard WR1 in Edelman for 5 seasons, 2 more half seasons of Gronk where he was easily Pro Bowl level if he had finished up healthy.

RB Montana definitely had the better one in Roger Craig, but despite that, the actual success of the run game between both teams were similar, because again, the Pats had the better OL and have lived over picking solid not great RBs that can have career seasons behind their OL.

Montana's biggest place where his team was more talented was his defense, but that's not what we're talking about here.  We're not talking about a Colts-style run team where the money was dumped onto the offense.  And because of BB  being on the Pats, even the extra money spent on the defense didn't provide that much of an advantage over the Pats defenses that Brady has had.",nfl

In the Patriots game he didn't play well. They had a pretty good drive to start the game with a really great 3rd down conversion and a beautiful TD pass to KA. The entire offense as a whole disappeared for the first half after that drive. (And a lot of that was our O-line also getting destroyed, which is still a concern heading into this season)

They were able to put together some drives in the second half, but it was over at that point.

Awesome...but wouldnt it be better if y'll had that 4 game W-streak against Rodgers? I feel better about the Packers when we are beating **good** NFCN teams instead of crap ones.

"Not missed a televised Lions game in 3 years.

I think the NFL broadcasting - adverts and all - is fine over the course of a 3+ hour broadcast. Not perfect, but more acceptable to me than UK footballs reliance on gambling advertisements and other sponsor-ridden factors, and far less expensive or costly on a personal level. 

The original point was that NFL teams not changing their jerseys every single year and slapping huge sponsor logos on them is something we should cherish. For me personally the current NFL broadcasts are a fair trade off for that. The amount of adverts within an NFL broadcast WILL become a problem if fans are also asked to fork out $100 a year for new jerseys with huge Geico or Wendy’s logos on the front.",nfl

Of course, if you camp outside without proper equipment in 5 degree weather, you're gonna be at critical risk. But my expectation is that it's very rare to have a 5 degree evening in Philly, where as it's common in more northern cities.

"My thoughts are that teams are not named after people/things as a sign of *disrespect* so I don't get the connection here.  Why is it only acceptable to name things after groups that *did* the shafting, instead of the groups that *got* shafted? My point with women is that it's obvious we shouldn't exclude *them* from having things named after them, but they're definitely a minority (as in treated as subordinate), marginalized and increasingly voiceless group... it seems pretty arbitrary to strike them from cultural references so as not to ""offend"" them.  They, like Native Americans, share our history for better or for worse, and the story of the U.S. (or humans for that matter) obviously can't be told without them. I think that opens the door to reference them in modern shared cultural events without having to walk on eggshells. They are part of us.

And one very important thing that people keep leaving out of this argument is that none of these teams are named after, or in any way reference present day Native Americans or their plight, so being named after a ""marginalized"" group doesn't make any sense in this context. The namesakes of these teams aren't ""marginalized"" groups because they don't even exist, any more than 49ers or Vikings.  These teams (like the Vikings, Raiders, Buccaneers, Patriots, Packers, 49ers or even Titans) are caricatures of past, bygone cultures. There are no longer braves running around with tomahawks, or native tribes roaming the plains hunting buffalo with flint arrowheads. Modern day Native Americans either read or were told about those past cultures just like us. So equating these references to a bygone culture with modern day Native Americans (as though modern Native Americans have not advanced beyond these primitive roots and are solely defined by them)  is both disingenuous, and if anything a slight against modern day Native Americans. I mean, Greeks have moved past the toga, and don't seem to get offended by people wearing them, despite having gone through countless of their own genocides, mass-murders, and marginalization.

Native Americans are completely intertwined with this country's history (and present). They aren't museum artifacts and are very much a part of American culture. There's no reason their ancestors should be excluded from having any cultural place in our society outside of History Channel documentaries. The rest of our past cultures sure are fair game. Referencing bygone Native American cultures is probably OK, imo.",nfl

"Okay, I know. But 

 1 in baseball the union is too powerful. You can't compare the union in baseball to football. You know that right? 

2 guys need to develop in baseball, you have players who start playing in the majors at the age of 26. MLB is a huge developmental curve and industry. 

NHL is a different, guys get out at the age 18 and are world beaters, you should see some of these dudes in the juniors, you'd think any of them would get drafted. AHL is important for young players to develop, essentially it's a developmental league and the rest are fillers. 

Basketball they do have D-league but, what are we talking about. Most dudes who get drafted in the NBA don't even play anyway. And if they're on a team it's only because of the stupid soft cap which forces bad teams to spend on mediocre players. 

It's really hard to make the NFL. Guys are huge, guys are bigger, stronger, faster, more technical, better smarts, just comparing the builds of players, you take a Myles Garrett and compare him to let's say Michael Sam.

And in the same vein, nobody compares Troy Aikman to Dan Marino. There’s no sane person on earth who puts Marino behind Aikman. You have to have the prerequisite stats before rings or wins starts to factor in

The happy flipside is that since the Pats aren't as overpoweringly dominant as the Warriors, there's far less of a ""this kind of ruins the league"" factor than there has been for a few years with the Warriors.

Rodgers actually has a record label. Which is why I use that. But that isn't the point; if this is allowed, why wouldn't any of the cases I listed be allowed? You're very fixated on this specific case, but I'm talking about the category of case. I am concerned that there is a team that is paying a player outside of the salary cap. I think that's inherently shady, just as if a Governor who owned a bunch of dairy farms started buying only his own farms' products. We'd call that corruption, because he's enriching himself through his position. Obviously this isn't corruption, but the idea is the same; we don't know if there is a captive agreement, where a theoretical player (since apparently discussing Brady specifically is verboten) agrees to a lower salary if the team handshakes to buy the player's non-football services.

"You guys had an average receiving corps for sure, some highs, some lows, and yes I agree that most of the QBs I had above Brady had better receiving corps (Wilson being the exception).  But Brady had a better offensive line than arguably anyone, with only Brees and Ryan being even close, that's not something that you can throw  away either, and it's debateable which is more important, WRs or OL pass pro, it's a similar debate in what's more important for pass pro, pass rush or CBs.  Then add onto that that Brady had one of the better run games of the group in addition to that, and a solid above average, fringe top 10 type defense.  His supporting cast wasn't flashy, but it was still good, and had no holes where it was below average.

And although I agree to some extent, a lot of the time their film grades also miss a ton of context.  Their CB grades are the best example, they completely fail to capture the value of a shutdown CB who doesn't have the opportunity to make big splash plays that grade well on film.  They had Tre'Davious White as the 62nd CB in the league. They also fail to account for volume as evidenced by their placement of Zeke in the 20s among RBs.  It's all a balance, you have to weigh everything.

And that's not true at all, there are many ways in which you can grade a player's performance, and it continues to get better over the years as we have more rankers contribute their own film/statistics/resources/etc.  The All-Pro voters, guaranteed, do less film/stat study than this group, yet that list is treated like near gospel at times.

"I'm cautiously optimistic on Harry's hands but I'm wary of assuming they're elite.

I think outside of guys with absolutely brilliant hands (e.g., Fitz) or unambiguously bad ones, hands are one of those areas where at least publicly available scouting resources and amateur review really struggle to categorize guys.

Harry's profiles usually mention hands as a strength but also do mention some weakness (NFL.com: ""suffered from a few focus drops headed into traffic"") and that's... actually pretty similar to what was said about Treadwell (NFL.com: ""Hands catcher with adequate body control who can climb the ladder and high point catches over defenders. Truly shines with ball-­tracking skills... had more focus drops in 2015 than over previous two seasons."").

Hands are just one of those things where it feels like general opinion gets it wrong really often, or lumps two players with very different hands into the same broad category, it feels like.

"Bell had shit communication with his teammates during his holdout. That is really the only diva thing he did while in Pittsburgh. Well except for his awesome touchdown celebrations with Juju and AB. He texted Conner during the year and tweeted support for him. He didn't burn any bridges leaving Pittsburgh and was very well liked by the Olineman and RBs/FB while here. It's a shame it didn't work out but it seems he landed in a good place. 

Just don't listen to his music, it is garbage.",nfl
"Pretty sure Rudolph and/or his agent has stated he'd be willing to restructure his contract in order to stay on the team.

So happy my team is one that players want to sign with, and more importantly, stay with. Don't think I've been able to say that for a long time, if ever.",nfl
"Right. The sport is already what it is. Having the already very few OT periods be an extra 5 mins isn’t changing that and has a minuscule effect on making the game more dangerous for players. 5 more mins is what? The continuation of the drive thats already going on and if they punt, then another drive with at most one more desperation drive after that. All just to get into FG range too. This isn’t an extreme situation. 

Its not really about Americans not processing ties. They just don’t make sense like they do for soccer where teams get a point and thats it. In the nfl teams get half of a win and a half of a tie, 6-9-1 is 6.5-9.5 and that sucks.  The teams with the tie get an advantage in playoff races which conversely fucks over the other teams in that race. 10-5-1 gets in over 10-6 and thats shitty. Ties only make sense in point systems and in leagues where ties aren’t a rarity. 

Wanna make the game safer? Give teams 2 bye weeks instead of 1. But “muh ratings!” Stop making teams play Thursday night games a mere 3 days after they just played. But “we need to dominate another night out of the week cause of muh ratings!” Cut the 4 preseason games into 2 games that are also spread out 2 weeks apart. So  instead of 2 travel weeks in august teams now only have 1 that is spread out a week away from the other game.  Also this format can be scheduled in a way that will let teams have a full 2 weeks before week 1 which helps. And for the loss of player evaluation from losing 2 preseason games, the league can maybe add more april may or june slots for team activities that are pretty limited right now. All these things would help the players way way more than an extra 5 mins in OT hurts them.",nfl
"Was Tom a game manager during the first 3 super bowl wins? First one I’ll give you sort of but his numbers were still really solid despite only starting 13 games, but in 03 he had the 6th most passing yards and had the 10th most tds and in 04 he had the 10th most yards and 6th most tds of any qb. Hell he lead the league in td passes in 2002.",nfl
"Running underneath a ball is easy, high pointing the ball is tough. You can go outside, run 20 yards and when the qb who has already thrown the ball yells ""ball"", you turn around, try to find it and catch it over your head.

Notice how shit NFL caliber DB's are at tracking the ball.",nfl
"Neither of those things are relevant.  That guy was acting like the Patriots and Brady are above making cocky statements before playing a game with the team and my example showed he was wrong.  Who the statements were said to and when we found out isn’t important because neither of those things are relevant to the central point, which is the fact that they both made the decision to say similar statements in similar situations.",nfl

The major themes were insurgency, irregulars &amp; uniformed soldiers and how the American military dealt with threats.",nfl
"I didn't say it affected the off-season signings but it gives a basis for where they were at, which is sub .500 just barely.

I know 2010 had two big games, but I can't even think of another playoff game between the two in my lifetime besides that. On the other hand the Lakers and Celtics have had many years when both were extremely good, and they've played each other in the Finals twice in recent years. There's still a LOT of hate between the two.

I'm not saying that rivalry games need to be high stakes to matter, I'm just saying that you might be more biased than you realize if you think that the Lakers–Celtics rivalry has dipped that much. I personally would rank the Bears–Packers rivalry in the top five among all American sports but not number one because the stakes haven't been there for a long time.",nfl
He's the QB I know best and certainly the one I have the most interest in. Which is why I feel reasonably well-positioned to note that in this case he's probably not the answer and other QBs have better best-4-consecutive-year-stretch arguments. The whole idea was to make a (hopefully) convincing but quick case that it's *not* Brady so the conversation can then focus on the other guys.,nfl
"I know you are joking but He has 0 playoff wins, 0 division titles, and lost every meaningful game, and even started a season 1-7, which then he was rewarded as the highest paid NFL player ever. Stafford isn’t losing the starting QB job to anyone, even if Jesus came down and wanted to start for the Lions, Lions fans will be like “hmm idk all Stafford needs is 52 future hall off famers on his team and his next season is going to be magical unlike his past decade of losing”",nfl
"I respect loyalty, I just woulda been sick to my stomach to witness a loss like that to my biggest rival in a home playoff game.

So...at least you’re not the Falcons!",nfl
"Probably not, Cam had a very special year where he was playing very very well. I mean I'd love to see it again, I have no hatred against the Panthers but I do agree that magic would be extremely hard to replicate. Who knows though the 2019-2020 season could be theirs.",nfl
"I get what you are trying to say, but deciding what any qb is after 2 years especially while playing behind a horrendous o line and very few weapons is a bit short sighted.

Lurie brought in Reid to replace the defensive-minded Ray Rhodes who was most memorable for beating the Lions in the playoffs his first year as head coach and chewing gum before Pete Carroll made it famous. Peete married Holly Robinson, (actress from 21 Jump Street and Hangin' with Mr. Cooper) became extremely religious and returned to football in 2002 to help the Jaguars to a middling season, then faded from that point on.",nfl
"I guarantee you watched neither of them play. Fumbles are a case by case thing, of course you’re going to fumble more when there’s 4 people tackling you and not one. Name one thing rushing wise that LT was better at than AP. Just one. And if you say vision the conversation is over, because AP in 2012 had some of the best vision a RB has ever displayed.",nfl
"Not to lend too much credibility to what OP is saying but Smith definitely did not always suck before Reid. His last two years in SF were brilliant, if a bit subdued. He got benched because he got hurt and Kaep stepped in and lit it up, not because of his own play.",nfl
"Bringing up 18 rushing touchdowns is foolish? That’s the most stupid take I’ve heard all week. If Wentz ran like Josh Allen and managed 20 career rushing touchdowns you’d add them in quickly. 

Also, let me FACT check you once again. QBR:
Wentz = 92.5 Dak = __96__.

And why remove Wentz’s horrendous year lmao? Eagles fan LOVE to say he’s played a full season before. They have no issue bringing up 2016. But they hate bringing it up when it’s about stats. Don’t cherry pick to suit your narrative. Include both of these young QB’s their full body of work. 

It would be ridiculous if people didn’t account for Wentz’s 2017 season in 2 years because “it was 4 years ago” wouldn’t it?",nfl
I am not kidding when I say Michael badgley. Yes he is a kicker but this dude drips with swag. Is very handsome and if he can have more big primetime game winners like he did against Pitt last year he will the dopest kicker in the game. He’s already banging all the insta models in LA,nfl
"look hate to bring this up but you can bring up the story of the NFL without mentioning Phillip Rivers unless you wanna get the Eli draft drama in. You cant leave out Warren Moon out of the story of the NFL tho, and it’s not like it was just cus he was black, but he also was incredible during his time",nfl
"In fairness, there is more context to him staying beyond simply honoring a contract.  The Bears made an offer to him just days after he had signed with the UFL's Hartford Colonials, so it's not like he was a longtime face in that league at the time.  Since he had joined the UFL in August 2010, Training Camp and preseason in the NFL were already underway, and McCown felt he wasn't really going to have much of a chance on an NFL roster so late into the offseason.

Cutler was cemented as the starter in Chicago, while McCown was guaranteed to start in Hartford; therefore, he'd have more film to present to NFL coaches when he decided to return to the league.  Furthermore, Hartford's HC was Chris Palmer, whom McCown wanted to play for.

Considering how he would ultimately lead the UFL in passer rating that year and eventually caught on with Chicago the following season, I suppose it worked out in the end?",nfl
"His argument is that if you were never the best at your position at any point, you shouldn't be in the Hall of Fame.

Peppers was probably never the best at his position. When Peppers was in his prime, Strahan, Freeney, and Allen were all better than he was at certain points (First Team All Pro doesn't necessarily mean you're the best DE, since two defensive ends win this award each year).

Yet, I think it's insane if anyone tries to keep Peppers out of the HOF because he was never the top defensive end in the NFL.",nfl
"February is a sweeps month. I'd think they would want add the games at the end of the season. You would have the conference championship games and the Superbowl in a sweeps month.

FitzMagic wasn’t gonna last He’s basically what he always was which is someone who’s gonna throw it deep often and go for broke. It works sometimes but a lot of the time it doesn’t. Jamies is similar but also younger and has more time to change his game. And the Foles Wentz comparison isn’t good Wentz has been the better QB whenever he’s played and was in MVP contention Bledsoe wasn’t playing great and Brady was there for the majority of the season. Foles is also much older than Wentz which is the opposite to the Bledsoe and Brady comparison.,nfl
"I agree with you on pretty much everything there. I just think people are WAY too quick to dismiss that type of QB. He's a stable, reliable starting QB who flirts with the top 10 year in and year out--I think that's way more valuable than people tend to think. Having a Brady or Mahomes or that guy in Green Bay is absolutely what everyone wants, to be sure, but there is an acceptable middle ground between than and desperately searching for a franchise QB for years... or for decades. 

You can build a team around a reliable starter and sure, you probably have to catch lightning in a bottle where everything goes right one year to win a title, but if you have *nothing* at that position you're dead in the water.",nfl
"No we are fine. (Stephen Holder of the athletic did some quick math and said that we will be fine). We have a lot of big name free agents coming up that we’ll have to open the wallet for, which is one reason why Ballard isn’t going hog wild during free agency 

Big Free Agents next year:
- Anthony Castanzo (LT)
- Eric Ebron (TE)
- Jack Doyle (TE)
- Jabaal Sheard (DE)
- Devin Funchess (WR)
- Clayton Geathers (S)
- others I’m forgetting 

We won’t sign all of them but Ballard is big on giving his players money if they play well.

Edit: “Big” means big for the Colts not for the league.",nfl
"I think Eli is kind of a special case because in terms of longevity as a great QB won’t get him in, but his accolades will get him in. Likes he probably would be one of, if not the worst QB in the HOF, but those playoff runs are very much huge in the history of the NFL",nfl
"i think that this hit and Dale Hunter's post-goal hit in the NHL are the best comparisons to what Gronk did. All of them happened after the play ended, with plenty of time to think out the actions, and with clear intent to badly injure the player what was hit.",nfl
"Well, the Eagles have played enough games in franchise history that evening that percentage is gonna be very hard. They're under by 24 games, which even if they won every game it would take a season and a half. So... 80 games over the next 5 years, they'd have to win 24 more games than they lose, so they'd have to go 52-26, or just under 11 wins a season. In theory it's doable... but unfortunately not every franchise is like the Patriots, so it might take them a bit longer, lucky for you as a Cowboys fan.

Washington, conversely, is only 10 games over. If they go 3-13 this year they'd be at .500, or 11-21 over the next two years would also do it. So to me it feels that would happen sooner. 

(God I hope my math was right)",nfl
"Here, I’ll address the nonsense you just spewed about one of the players.

Mike Evans
Game 1: 1 for 16 yds
Game 2: 4 for 48 yds

Michael Thomas

"Pats have been doing this for years. It’s not rocket science and it amazes me how many teams still feel like it’s worth paying one RB $13m. 

A respectable RBBC completely mitigates your injury risks, gives you a ton of matchup flexibility, and ensures fresh legs in the 4th quarter of every game.",nfl
Nah. I watched Reggie throughout his career and had the displeasure of watching Smith absolutely wreck my team 2/3 times a season. They reached the numbers they did in a less pass happy league and were premier run stuffers while they were at it. To say Watt is close is in my opinion also way wrong as you put it. Watt is awesome at what he does and is a ton of fun to watch but he nor anyone else in the current NFL are as good as those guys.,nfl
"OP gave the nod to Brady in which I dissected why he wasn’t. So now you have to change the topic

Collins wasn’t washed he just can’t run an offense In which the QB is also the OC ,has to make pre snaps adjustments, has to actually throw it down field and make tight window throws on a constant basis. Unlike Cassel, Garrapolo, Brisett in NE which has a ton of easy throws, a ton of first read throws, a ton of pick plays which are pre designed, lead the league in screen passes constantly.


Talks about washed but brings up Reggie Wayne name LOL. Doesn’t bring up the fact than a old Welker went on to have his best TD season under Peyton while missing 3 games. Brings up receiver but forgets to bring up Brady have the best pass protection of any QB in the last 29 seasons.",nfl

"If we're talking about the entirety of their careers, I actually would have to disagree on Rodgers there. If he joined a few years into his career, absolutely. If we're talking he gets drafted and thrown into the exact same circumstances as Brady, though, then I firmly disagree. The reason he's as good as he became was largely due to the time he was able to spend working on his throwing mechanics the first couple years of his career. If he gets thrust into a starting role like Brady did early in his career, Rodgers doesn't get that time  to develop his mechanics, and thus likely doesn't reach the same level of play that he has. Don't get me wrong, I still think he would be a good QB, but more like current Matt Stafford type good where he's a definite franchise QB but isn't among the elite.",nfl
"I would never consider it.  Been a Cowboys fan for life, and my dad has been a Cowboys fan his whole life.  My allegiance to the Mavs is a bit less strong, and I used to root for both the Rangers and Astros (but more for the Rangers) in baseball until MLB decided to make them division rivals.",nfl
"Not really though. Michael Pierce isn't a good pass rusher. May be great at run stopping but not pass rushing. 


And yes, that is the logic. You want to give your team the best chance to block the defense which means doubling the best and hoping the others can win their one on one. So having a Smith, Judon, and Suggs who can win those one on ones means the defense can attack different ways.",nfl

I was using him as a substitution. 

Statistically, any edge defender that leaves Baltimore performs poorly. Name me just one player that has lived up to their contract since leaving Baltimore. 

Re: DL- Williams is a run stuffing DT, but if you leave him with just one blocker, he’s getting by with ease. You have to double him. Pierce, on the other hand, is a great pass rusher. Graded by PFF at 97.0 last season. So...",nfl

I could be wrong on this, I do believe Sterling Shepard is good, but I disagree with him. I know his numbers should go up with Odell gone, but I think he will still be second fiddle to Barkley (Eli is very good at throwing to his main target), and he should have more safety attention on him.

How about you start with not making a QB the highest paid NFL player ever with 0 playoff wins and 0 division titles who has lost every meaningful game.

"&gt; Rodgers, who had almost completely autonomy over the offense during Mike McCarthy's reign as head coach, has predictably scoffed at this notion.

Laquon Treadwell. At this point he's not even the #3 WR on the Vikings with Chad Beebe being talked up as the team's #3. The team doesn't gain anything financially from cutting him in the final year of his rookie deal but when you drafted 2 WRs late in the draft I think you're more likely to keep a rookie who might produce down the road over a guy who has done nothing in three years just because he was a first round pick. Treadwell is 4th or 5th on our depth chart. He may not make the team this year and assuredly is not going to be with the team in 2020.,nfl

"&gt;You can’t honestly think Dak would get less than 32

Again, I never said I think he *will* get less. I feel like I'm repeating myself. What I think is that both sides want to get a deal done, and a deal *will* get done. I have no doubts about that. I disagree that he has ""all the leverage"" however. In your fantasy where Dak's agent thinks he has all the leverage and is asking for $36m and the Cowboys are offering $30m and neither side will budge, the leverage the Cowboys have is in being content to let him play out the last year of his deal making $2m with no big guarantees in case of injury, and risking his value taking a hit by playing poorly. Then if they still want to play hardball next off-season, he could get a franchise tag, etc. If this situation were actually in the cards, I think both sides would be smart to do a Kirk Cousins type deal, something like 3 years 88.5m fully guaranteed. And if he really, *really*, just doesn't want to play here, we would just trade him... I don't see a situation where we are ""fucked.""",nfl

"&gt; My personal issue is they haven't addressed how they got into the position to have to draft another QB in the first round 

I mean lets be real. The organization's biggest mistake was hiring Mike McCoy, who I believe was the worst offensive coach in PFF history to still have a playcalling job, *before* last season.

Outside of that they had a bad situation. A legit QB retired and great offensive coach retired at the same time with a fairly mediocre roster. They also couldn't have predicted the O-line injuries they had being *that* abnormal.

&gt;(with the first pick no less)

Would they be in any different of a situation if the Raiders, Jets, and 49ers all lost another game? It's irrational to think they did a worse job than they did, just because there were fewer teams at the very bottom of the barrel. than some other years.

And basically there's no way they draft a QB if they had the same exact season but the Raiders play worse than they did somehow. Kyler is an infinitely better prospect than Rosen was, and that's why they drafted him.

&gt;One year after trading up to draft Rosen. 

This point needs to stop being brought up.  It's a mid-3rd and a 5th. That's so unbelievably trivial in the context of trades to get QBs.  

&gt;That's a complete and abject failure in the GM and coaching scouting staff which should be rectified

Again, I bring up irrationality because simply could not have predicted Rosen being  the worst passer from a clean pocket in the NFL. He was so unbelievably far below the average person's expectations that you can't fault them for taking a shot a missing. 

Personally I believe they had the best 2019 draft class, even without my Kyler hype. Firing literally everyone just because they missed on a QB prospect could have  fucked that up as  well. You have to think of things procedurally.",nfl

Bortles is a grown ass man who's tens of millions already at this point of his career and that for not being very good. He can take the criticism.

Besides it's just stretching peoples disbelief if you constantly give non-answers and say the new guy is as good as the old guy. If Aaron Rodgers got traded to a team to replace Nathan Peterman no one would believe it for a second if the guys said that the two were comparable.

Of course you don't need to publicly berate the old QB, just compliment the new guy on what you think he does well and if that makes the old guy look bad, so be it.

"Howie does a ton that is too complicated for me to understand let alone speak to, but the four key macro elements of his success are basically long contracts, high singing bonus, and early extensions for foundational players/positions

* Long contracts have three advantages - they keep ahead of the market rise for a position, they spread out the signing bonus cap hit further (to the point that Howie frequently uses phantom cap years, where the contract literally says ""this is a 7 year deal, but if the player is on the roster after year 5 then they will be cut). Players like this because they get paid their signing bonus for the entire contract now, and they get much more stability - they can buy a house and send their kids to school, and if they get suddenly cut they get more money as a result, versus a shorter deal that might be more efficient but leads to the need to constantly shop around and move
* The high signing bonus gets spread out across the entire contract in terms of cap, and so the more you can frontload, generally the better. Players like this because they get paid right away and can use/invest the money. The risk is dead cap (see: OBJ or MBC), but the Eagles are pretty careful at only giving this kind of contract to key players
* Early Extensions get ahead of the market for marquee positions and players, and allow the team to pay relatively less. Players like this because again they get the money now, and they also have much more job security for years

This is built on two things that I think are popularly underrated in NFL contracts - money now and stability

* For money now, the way that Howie structures contracts gets players cash today. This does incur risks for the team if that player gets hurt, regresses, or gets traded, but if they stay on the team their cap hit is significantly reduced in the long term (the team can afford the money, the cap is the issue). Players like this because they get paid today and can either waste or invest that money - if they invest, they'll probably make more than they would if they got the money year over year. An example of this is the infamous Mets Bobby Bonilla contract, where he's paid a million dollars every year. Bonilla made less money off of that contract than if the Mets paid him a lump sum at the very beginning of the contract, and he'd dumped the money in the stock market. It's the same deal for the NFL, except even more because the salary cap hit gets spread out along the entire contract so there's even more of an incentive to load up the signing bonus if you plan to keep them around
* I think it's really undervalued how much players value stability. They get paid so much that it's a bit hard to be sympathetic, but imagine living in a world where your job could force you to move across the country at the drop of a hat with no warning or compensation. And you can't refuse or else you'll be fired and effectively blacklisted for life. Do you have a house? Sorry, rent a hotel room until you figure something out. You have a wife and kids? Sucks, you've got practice at 8AM tomorrow in LA, get there. But signing a long term contract with lots of up front money means that you've got much more stability - it simply costs more for the team to trade or cut you, and they are less likely to. Sure you might make a few million more if you shopped around or took a shorter contract - but do you want to move your kids around from school to school to school to school as you jump between teams in search of a paycheck? Wouldn't you rather take a couple million less in order to stay in the same house and same school and see your kids every day?",nfl

2018 was 11th and 2009 was 17th, for what it’s worth. So same number of Top 10, plus an 11th. And firmly more top 16. 

And none of Rodgers’ teams were 11 or 17, just to be clear (2008 was 12 though). And 2014 was 16 — so although using ”top half” kind of makes sense, it also conveniently makes your argument look much stronger than using “top 15” or “top 17.”

Arik Armstrong is elite at the run off the edge too but that dude ain't getting shit cuz he's not a good pass rusher.",nfl

"He actually made a really good point several months ago that I hadn't considered. Basically, all the balls would go his way in 2-minute situations but rarely in the scripted parts of the offense, which shows that he had more value than box score numbers would indicate and was underutilized here.

He took things a step further than that to rant about how the front office/ownership influences offensive touches and playing time, but I think mostly it just reflects Garrett/Linehan ineptitude. Witten expressed a similar sentiment during our blowout MNF loss to Tennessee, about how he ""hated"" that we wouldn't go into the hurry-up more often because we consistently moved the ball more effectively that way.",nfl

"At this point my qb standards have risen, and it takes a lot more than just plain superbowls. 

Even without superbowls Tom Brady has the highest winning percentage ever, pretty much every playoff record, had the record for most passes to begin a career without an interception, has held multiple single season passing records throughout his career and will finish first or second on the all time list depending on how the next guy finishes. 

Brees is a beast and has done the most with the least out of players I will mention in this post. Until this year when Mahomes topped 5k, he had as many 5k seasons as everyone else combined. He has kept teams competitive without a running game or a defense, staying one of the clear pillars of the NFL throughout his career. He is the picture of sustained excellence at his position and  has often pulled production out of a cast of wide receivers that you would only find relevant in New Orleans because outside of Brandin Cooks they have struggled to produce elsewhere. He has the highest completion percentage in a single season and the most insane accuracy I have ever seen.

Aaron Rodgers is the bane of my existence. So much that even on a list like this I need to acknowledge how great he is. Pre play hes a wizard, and has earned more yards by luring the defense offsides than most young qbs drafted throw for before they are out of the league. After the snap, he is just as good. He creates miracles to stay on his feet and finds the right player to make what should be an impossible throw look easy. He is a safe bet to be top 3 in touchdowns any season he plays wire to wire, and also to throw the least interceptions. If your looking to see if a quarterback measures up to the gold standard, his dick is the one you use. His team is always in playoff or superbowl contention because he makes that big of a difference when he is on the field. So much that until recently the team never thought it was remotely nessisary to pickup any pieces to help him offensively. Only one team is currently more reliant on their starting quarterback to produce, and thats Seattle's Russell Wilson who is on the cusp but still needs to finish out his career with more stellar play.

Ben Roethlisberger is the last guy I can think of who is a lock even after removing his superbowls from his resume. He came 3 yards short of a 5k season, and has consistently thrown for over 4 since Pittsburgh transitioned to an offensive team. He wins, and has always won. He is third in win percentage among active players, and third in total wins among active players, as well as second in post season wins and percentage. The biggest thing going against Ben is his history of having a strong supporting cast, but that has been possible because they haven't needed to waste picks searching for a qb because they have had him, and also because he develops and brings out the best in his reciever core. Antonio Brown, Plaxico Burress, Mike Wallace, Santana Moss, have all left town as the blue ribbon pig after having Ben feed them up. Hes already made JuJu look like hes the next one to blow up. 

There are my 4 guys you can talk into the hall of fame without superbowls. DangeRuss may be the next to join this group, but realistically to me everyone that is dependent on a superbowl doesn't belong anyway, and anyone who hasn't earned one probably would have if they reached the same level as these future hall of famers. Go ahead, try and do this for Eli.",nfl

"Two games - Lions and the Pats. Pats looked at the Lions' blueprint and adopted it to ridiculous effect. If other teams can do the same, Goff could be in strife. He wouldn't be the first QB who is great for a season or two and then gets figured out.

"Well, if the level of play needed to disrupt Mayfield is the best defensive player in the league, then he'll be alright haha. Average time of a sack is 4.3 seconds. Average time to throw for a QB is 2.7 seconds, Mayfield's was around 2.46 or 2.47. Now Donald is elite, so take a full second off of the average, even 1.5, and he still, if he continues his second half of the year average, would get the ball off because presnap reads and quick decisions neutralize pass rush. There's definitely problems inherent in ignoring the positions that literally affect every play, I wish we would've beefed up the O-line a bit, and he'll get hit/pressured sometimes. Aaron Donald and others will definitely get to him at times, but this kid is pretty good so I think he'll be alright, but as you said we'll see. I cant wait for this season.

Why? He extremely polished as a pass rusher and won inside, outside, and with power.

Ferrell, for example, is way more raw.

"I don't know how it ""failed."" By what metric? 

They didn't keep it, but the main reason it wasn't a big hit is because they planned it poorly. You'd think you'd space out the two byes so that teams would have their two byes pretty far apart, but they didn't do that. They also had no teams on bye for the last six weeks. They concentrated the byes too much in the middle of the schedule, which meant during that stretch there were also a pretty low number of games to broadcast. 

You also have to remember that the NFL didn't even have one bye-week until 1990, so this was only the 4th year of any byes at all. People weren't used to their team being off, so having your team off for two weeks was probably a bit jarring.

Actually spread the byes out in a way that makes sense, and we've got 4 more teams in the NFL than we did in '93, and we've all gotten used to the bye week, so it's not a huge change to add one more bye week, and I think it would work just fine. Especially if it made Thursday Night Football better. 

If anything, the NFL hasn't done it because they're gonna use it as a bargaining chip in the next CBA.

Fights do break out pretty regularly actually especially if there's a late hit on a QB or just a dirty hit in general. It's just talking shit about their game and what they're about to do etc just like most sports. There's no point to break out in fight because of it when the very next play you're gonna be hitting your opponent in gameplay anyway. Plus coaches and your teammates wouldn't like it very much if you lose your cool and start a fight unnecessarily just because someone talked a little heat. That's how you get a penalty and hurt your team.,nfl
"Since you like QBR so much, you should probably check it before making yourself look stupid. Wentz has had a better QBR the last 2 years. Wentz's QBR in 2017 was 78.5 vs Dak in 2016 which was 77.6. I know math can be hard for some but 78.5 &gt; 77.6. Also Dak's QRB was rank 17th in the league last year or bottom half of the league.

I shouldn't really be surprised that you're referencing Dak's rookie year though. Dallas fans love living in the past.",nfl

"The city is populous, but L.A is home to a bunch of non native/transplants from other regions in the U.S or even the world. It's one of the reasons why football isn't as big in LA, compared to something like Basketball which is more popular internationally.

Raiders are still popular in their stint in LA during their golden period, and is the only team while in LA to ever win a Super Bowl for the city(This coincided with years of Success in LA, as the Lakers, Dodgers, and then at the time Kings won their respective championships or were great teams), and has left a mark on some of the more permanent residents of the area.

The only way another team aggressively goes after him is if they already have the roster around him, and if that's the case they can't give him more.   


Half the teams that could give him that much already have their future guy, and the other half it'd just be a lateral move at best. There's a glut of young unprovens at QB right now, middle aged proven mediocres just don't get the attention they used to",nfl
"&gt;I’ll never win this stupid argument since I have a cowboy flair, but if Dak played for any other team people would expect him to make about what Wentz does when his time’s up.

The only position Dallas is firmly better in is at RB but defense, o-line, wr, te, special teams, are all equal or favor the Eagles.

"You put the wrong link.

But to give my opinion on your question, Rosen was shat on/not even talked about until he was moved out of Arizona and now people just feel bad about him.  He was by far the worst rookie QB and now people will say it was because of his team but during the season, there wasn't this amount of sympathy for him.  Personally, I think he's just a bad QB.

As far as Allen, people still thoroughly criticise him and his lack of passing ability.  He has definitely been a polarizing figure.  However, I do think that Lamar gets more criticism (mainly cause I'm coming from a fan base that does a lot of it) and--besides rivalry--it's because Lamar is exactly what everyone expected him to be.  An insanely athletic QB with a questionable arm running a gimmicky offense.  There was no surprise when he started doing that this season and it's incredibly easy to hate a successful gimmicky offense.  Mobile QBs are very annoying to play against.

Meanwhile, Allen's athleticism has come out of nowhere.  He was the prototypical, monster-armed, QB and was drafted because of his ideal QB build, not his athleticism.  So it was kind of a revelation when this dude started running (scrambling, not designed runs) for 100 yards a game and jumping over people.  The surprise of it all definitely lead people to criticise him less.

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, Buffalo sucks (sorry Bills, still love ya).  They weren't a threat last year and so nobody really gave a shit.  Same thing happens with all bad teams.  Just look at the Browns, we were the lovable losers a season ago and now that we're looking to compete, theres a lot of vitriol thrown our way.  As opposed to the Ravens who were a good team and a threat.  If the Ravens sucked and Lamar was doing his thing, there would be far less criticism of him because there wouldn't be a threat of losing to him.

But sure, there are definitely some racists who hate him cause he's black.  I don't think that's the main reason for most people though.  It's just easy to say and make it seem so ""black and white"".",nfl
"&gt; Oct 2015 (NDSU): He broke a bone in his right wrist that required surgery.

&gt;Aug 2016 (Eagles): He fractured ribs in the preseason against the Buccaneers. This injury caused him to only miss a few preseason games, though he would have also likely missed some ""real"" time had it occurred during the regular season.

&gt;Dec 2017 (Eagles): He tore his ACL and LCL. He did not return until Week 3 of the 2018 season.

&gt;Oct (?) 2018 (Eagles): He played with a fractured bone in his back until he was replaced by Nick Foles with three games remaining in the regular season. He never returned, obviously. The exact date of Wentz's back injury is unknown, but he first appeared on the injury list with back issues in October last season. (We'll get to the Eagles' medical staff in a bit.)

How is he not injury prone?",nfl
"Both are problems. IIRC I think Julio has the most yards per game by a WR against a single team in the history of the NFL against TB, averaging something like 125 yards per game.

"I think that the best way to determine the best division is to look at how successful it is. 

Here's a table showing Conference Championship Appearances (CCA), Super Bowl losses (SBL) and Super Bowl wins (SBW) over the past ten years:

:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|AFCE|10|2|3|
|NFCW|7|3|1|
|NFCN|6|0|1|
|NFCS|5|2|1|
|AFCN|4|1|1|
|AFCW|3|1|1|
|AFCS|3|1|0|
|NFCE|2|0|2|

Clearly, the AFCE is a powerhouse of a division, far and away the best division in the NFL.

(Kidding. Mostly.)

The NFCW IMO has been the best division over the past decade. Three teams have made the Super Bowl, only the AFCE has had more Conference Championship appearances, and heading into the 2019 season I think that four all teams in the division have the potential to win the Super Bowl.",nfl
"Wasnt he actually convicted of abuse at one point in the past? Is there no an audio recording of what is easily passes the threshold of a threat of bodily harm. You're confusing court terms with how the world views things. In the eyes of s court yes he is innocent. As he has not been proven guilty of anything. The public however has a much MUCH lower requirement for proof before they can and will judge you. The NFL believe there is a CPS investigation happening. The police basically said we dont have enough evidence for a criminal charge but did say that a crime was committed. They just lack evidence of who did it to the child

His checkered past which he has failed to distance himself from and has now said things that give backing to what people say. 

As of now he is a suspect in a crime and I dont think you could deny that. He has been investigated and not charged but that doesnt mean the police have ruled him out. Far from it. Especially in instances like this without a first hand witness testimony or video the likelihood of any person being charged in a case like this is low because there just simply is no evidence in any direction.",nfl
A rested defense facing a rested offense is a better situation for the defense to be in than a tired defense against a tired offense because defensive players are more reliant on athleticism and reactions than offense are.

"&gt;Without Hill, Kelce, or Hunt those a lot of those tds don't happen.

It's not those players that without them those TDs wouldn't happen. It's Mahomes. We had all 3 of those players with Smith in 2017, and between them they managed just 18 touchdowns. Compare that to 29 with Mahomes. 

Mahomes clearly elevated a lot of players stats this last season just by how ridiculously well he played. Another example, Chris Conley had been with us for 3 full seasons before Mahomes and spent most of that time as the #2 receiver on our team. In 3 seasons as a starter he managed just 1 touchdown, but with Mahomes he had 5. 

I don't think it's totally unreasonable to suggest that Mahomes could get the most out of whatever receivers he had to deal with. Because he's already proven he can do significantly more, with what he had last year; than what we were able to accomplish in the past with the same players.",nfl

"Children play Rounders

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounders

&gt; Played in England since Tudor times, it is referenced in 1744 in the children's book A Little Pretty Pocket-Book where it was called Base-Ball. As of 2015 it is played by seven million children in the UK

&gt; The main differences between baseball and the Rounders England version of the game are that the rounders bat is much shorter and is usually swung one-handed; misses or strikes are not called, so there are no walks or strike-outs; each batter receives only one good ball and must run whether they hit it or not. Other differences include the posts for marking the bases, which should be wooden, and are preferably encased in plastic sheaths, the lay-out of the pitch, especially the location of the last base; and the bowler's arm motion, which is an underarm pendulum action, as in softball.",nfl
"Hilariously revisionist history. Daks coach won coach of the year his rookie season and he had romo helping on the sideline. Our o-line is marginally better at best, both groups are very talented. And Carson’s receivers his rookie year were worse than anything Daks ever played with. Seriously Dorian Green Beckham was his #2 receiver.

That game was incredible and I fell in love with the game. The year after that, the Jets went to the AFCCG, and the year after that, we went back and lost to the Steelers in 2010. That was an amazing game to watch. I'd root for the Jets over Steelers obviously, all the way.

Nearly every single performance improvement in athletes is a result of modern understanding of the following:

* Training methods
* Nutrition
* Equipment

Combine this with the economics enabling athletes to train full time and year round. Sometimes from when they were 13 years old and on AAU teams (or similar). 

Great athletes from the past such as LeRoy Selmon, Walter Payton, Randy White, John Hannah, and many, many more would--if taking advantage of today's advances--kick the shit out of you and most of your favorite players today.

The single biggest change that actually did have a big effedt on the NFL was the strict testing of PED (mostly steroids). This allowed naturally big men to be in the league at a slightly higher rate than the steroid user who was more naturally about 250 pounds.

Within a couple years of the change, OL and DL started having many, many 300+ pounders...and many of the 280 pound steroid users couldn't stay in the league.

Hall of Famers like Randy White, who u/gyman122 thinks would get throttled, would still be stars. White had great technique, a Hall of Fame teammate, and a great scheme that used his skill set. White's ability (and strength) are similar to Aaron Donald in today's game. White would dominate. He'd be making all kinds of Pro Bowls. He would be a great 3-Tech. No, you tend to not have a 260 pound NT, but teams are actually doing even that on Defense to get more pass rush on some downs.

Meanwhile, plenty of 310 pound OL and DL dudes just get bounced out of the league. Skills matter. Competitiveness matters. Intelligence matters.

This is MASSIVELY unpopular. I understand why people get confused. 300,000 years of steady human development...and then BOOOOOOM!!! Shit goes vertical because today's boys just gotta be so much better than old timers.

"Defense is significantly less stable year to year than offense, but it's more *how* the Bears defense was good in 2018 than just *that* they were good.

QB Hits are more sustainable year to year than sacks, and based on that, the Bears had almost 8 sacks above expectation in 2018. We should expect that to regress.

Since 2006, there have been 15 teams to catch more than 23 interceptions in a season. Of those 15 teams, only 1 of them (the 2010 Packers) had *more* interceptions the following season, and only 5 of them still had 20+ INTs the following year. The average # of INTs for teams with 23+ INTs the following season over that time is 18.43, and that's despite the 2010 Packers going from 24 to 31. If we look at them as an outlier, the new INT average for the next year drops to 17.46.

I don't know how you can look at a team with Cam Newton, Luke Kuechly, Greg Olsen and others and not think they're one of the most likeable in the entire league. I won't lobby for them to be #1 (though with my bias clearly they're my #1), but they have to be top 10

People don't actually look at our numbers for whatever reason. The only top 20 or so player that is almost definitely not being signed again is Byron Jones and he's only had 1 mostly good year.

"So no team with one great safety has ever had a hole exposed at the other spot? No team with a great pass rush has ever had the weak link of their secondary exposed?

It's also odd to act like anyone could watch Fangio film and run his exact same defense. If that's the case, why isn't everyone doing it? Why is there ever a regression when a team changes coordinators? Fact is, playcalling and week-to-week scheming has a lot to do with it.

I think Bears fans get this idea that people are expecting the defense to be a trainwreck. That's not the case. The defense is too talented to be awful. But they were an outlier in how great they were last year, and you guys still went one-and-done in the playoffs. Even a minor regression to a top 5 defense (or a reduction in turnovers, which is highly likely) is cause for concern.",nfl

That said, that only strengthens my argument.  If you spend the money on the O-line, it not only makes your RB matter even less, but it also strengthens your passing game too.

IMO you spend huge money in two places on offense - QB and OL.  If those two things are in place, you can put mediocre talent at RB/WR and still have a very productive offense.",nfl
"Your wide receiver is a son of a bitch. He was a son of a bitch when he abused his pregnant girlfriend before he was drafted. He was a son of a bitch when he threatened his current one.

"Eight games in Brady was on pace for 40 pass TD, 4 rush TD, 4 INT and a 115 passer rating. Had Gronk and Dola each been healthy for one more game apiece Brady probably ends the year with 40 pass TD even if the INTs would probably have been around 5-7 anyway

Those first ten weeks were so fun. Brady throwing to Gronk, Edelman, Amendola and Lewis was dynamite. If it weren't for his 2017 postseason run Id say 2015 was Amendola best season in NE, as he was great as the #3 that year and consistently stepped up when Edelman went down vs Indy and week 10 on. As for Brady and the offense itself those first ten weeks were 2007 esque numbers.

Fun notes, thats not even necessarily Bradys best 10 or so game stretch in a season. In the first 10 weeks of 2017 Brady threw 22 TD and only 2 INT. In 2016 Brady threw 28 TD and 2 INT in a 12 game [season.](https://season.In) In 2012 started with 21 pass TD, 3 INT, and 2 rush TD. 2011 threw 19 TD and rushed in 3 with 2 INT over the final 8 games. In 2010 after starting with 10 TD and 4 INT, Brady threw 26 TD and 0 INT in the final 11 weeks. And of course 2007 when Brady threw 30 TD, ran in 2 TD, and had 2 INT over 8 games. Offenses tend to slow down, and things like injuries happen, and obv we need to judge the whole 16 game season, but its just crazy some of the streaks of excellence we have seen by Brady.",nfl

"I still don't understand how anyone can question Eli's place in the Hall. Two improbable super bowl runs, one in which he helped take down the 18-0 Patriots with one of the most iconic plays in NFL history, and it's pretty easy to make his case. 

Calling his career long and average with two good seasons is a joke and completely undersells the fact that he won TWO super bowls against the greatest dynasty of modern football. Without Eli we would be constantly hearing ""EIGHT RANGZ"" from Pats fans. 

The only people who don't think Eli belongs in the Hall of Fame are either too young to actually remember how good a QB he used to be and how instrumental he was in those playoff runs or they just wanna circlejerk on Reddit about him not being a HOFer. 

His consecutive starts streak, durability, two rings, and volume stats combined with a top five iconic play in league history to help topple what would have been the greatest season in NFL history make this decision easy.",nfl

The only lineman worth trading up for in this draft was Jonah imo, so it's frustrating but I can understand it.",nfl
That too is an over-simplification. Look at the case of Mack. I'll bet one of the reasons why he held out and forced a trade is so not only would he be paid maximum dollar but that he would finally be surrounded by talent and have a chance to win.

"Troy Brown player a lot of corner for the Pats in the 2004 season due to an extreme lack of depth in their secondary that year, in addition to his normal jobs as a receiver and punt return. Also a lot of defensive lineman have and are used as fullbacks in goal line formations. In terms of a player playing a lot of consistent  snaps on both sides I think those days are done and mostly they get used for a formation or two. Perhaps extreme circumstances will force a team to be like the 2004 Pats and use a receiver as a corner as well but with the extreme physical toll the game takes on players bodies now, I don’t think there is a player who could do it anymore. Players are so much bigger, faster and stronger and train for that one position for so long that very rarely do we see players convert positions and do well (I am aware of Richard Sherman and Julian Edelman). While not impossible I think Troy Brown was the last.",nfl

"That's a good point, but I think Belichick would have likely been a successful head coach with the Pats even if he didn't hit the lottery with Brady. Assume the team totally goes off the rails after Bledsoe's injury in 2001, and finishes 3-13, after going 5-11 in Belichick's first year. Not good, but I don't think Kraft fires him after 2 seasons. In 2002 the Patriots went 9-7 and missed the playoffs in reality, with Brady leading the league in TD passes. However, Brady wasn't close to his peak yet, and replacing him with Bledsoe that season would probably still have been a decent team with around a .500 record. 2003 and 2004 were some of the best Patriots teams ever, driven largely by the defense, and they would have been very good teams even if you replaced Brady with a league average QB. Maybe they don't win any rings if they don't have Brady, but it seems likely that after 2004 Belichick would be considered a fairly successful head coach with any non-terrible QB.

Obviously these hypotheticals are a little silly, but for me it's much easier to imagine Brady on a different team never getting a real chance to develop versus Belichick and the Patriots failing without Brady.",nfl

"A big thing when you watch the games is that Brady’s defense, more often than not, comes through for him in the 4th and gives him opportunity after opportunity to get the W. Then when he does lead that game winning drive, they hold strong. Manning’s, more often than not, is the exact opposite. He plays bad or struggles for a half and it was often over. Or if they had the lead late, his defense would falter. Few exceptions of course but overall that’s how it generally went.",nfl
"I mean the comparison is stupid anyways.  Marino came up in a different era and style of play was incredibly different.  80's and 90's QB's for the most part had to be tall pocket passers.  Defenders could still lead with the helmet and it was expected the QB could throw under pressure accurately and take a hit.

Zoom to now.  The average QB is expected to be mobile if the pocket collapses.  The best QB's are the ones that can throw on the run, or tuck and run.  Back then, fullbacks were utilized runners, but now a fullback is nothing more than glorified lineman.  The game has changed to the point the fundamental skills for QB's have changed.

Could Marino have 500-600 yard games now?  Probably not.  He was a pocket passers, not a mobile utility QB.  He'd probably still be a great QB, even elite; but his numbers would be similar to Favre and Manning, both exceptional pocket QB's.

How did Mahomes put those numbers up last year?  He scrambled before throwing.  Defenses have to guard against mobile QB's and when one of them leaves the pocket, the defense has to move up, leaving deep threats an opportunity.  Marino would never pull backs and cover LB's.  He wasn't a mobile threat and thus he would have much less opportunity for extra deep passes that are otherwise available to mobile QB's with a cannon.",nfl

So much so that they have gone through 6 or 7 trials (some ended with ""hung juries"" some convicted but then the convictions were reversed on appeal).

Honestly if you look at the point in great QB's careers at which it is obvious that they're really good, you'd probably say the opposite.

By end of 2nd year: Carson Wentz, Jared Goff, Deshaun Watson
 
By end of year 3: Matt Ryan, Matt Stafford, Andrew Luck, Derek Carr

"I have a long post on this from another comment, but I think that bill is empowered by Brady because of Brady’s adaptability. Bill can say, here’s one of the best wrs of all time and poof record breaking season. Or he says here’s a couple of tightends and Brady still succeeds. Or he can say here’s a college qb and a bunch of running backs who can catch and it still works. I don’t think any other qb has played with as diverse a set of offensive styles and succeeded as Brady. Which allows belichick to do what he talks about here on defense on the offensive side as well. He doesn’t have to pay $16m for Brandon cooks, he can just completely change the format and Brady will adjust. 

I agree that belichick would win with Rodgers or luck or Peyton, but I don’t think he’d win as many as he had with Brady because Brady allows him to get what is available and cheap. Brady’s had a top five season with a gunslinging offense, a dink and dunk offense, a tightend focused offense, a slot heavy offense, etc. Peyton was a gunslinger and when that faded, he was enough of a game manager to win a super bowl with a crazy defense, but Brady’s longevity and his success with belichick is due to toms ability to play whatever offense belichick can create and that his physical abilities allow. 

Bill would build a winning offense around Rodgers or manning, but with Tom he doesn’t have to build it around him, he just builds the offense he wants and Tom can be a top five qb in that style regardless.",nfl

We have a below average WR group, although our top 3 aren't bad by any means, but everyone else on the unit has very high potential.",nfl
"Since I’m not sure if 06 with the Gleason block or various 09 games count as “recent” I’ll go with 2017 week 3 at Carolina. 

At that point our entire division was undefeated and we were winless, and were staring down the barrel of a 4th consecutive 0-3 start. There was at that point serious talk of breaking up the Payton/Brees duo. 

Instead we won 34-13, picked off Cam 3 times, and Alvin Kamara scored his first NFL TD. That was the start of an 8 game winning streak and really where this current Saints team began",nfl

The Kirk deal was just so so monumentally bad. He is a stat sheet monster against bad teams and may win a few close ones vs good teams but when the lights shine brightest he just disappears. I never wanted him but I was optimistic. This year is literally no excuses with the OL additions, and new TE. Man I wish we had an out after this year. May have to package a pick to just unload him Brock Lobster to Cleveland style. For all the good Spielman has done he has made 2 awful moves concerning QB. Teddy why did your knee have to explode?",nfl
"Weird, because I knew Patriots fans who admitted to me that Tom Brady definitely declined as a whole last season. Most of them will acknowledge that the Patriots' defense won them the Super Bowl(I mean, that's fucking irrefutable). Even in the AFC Championship Game, Sony Michel was the game MVP because he was able to get the Pats a 14-0 lead mainly due to his running.

I would guess it's more of the Angry Tom Brady fans mob, which are technically a different breed than Pats fans(Pats fans actually root for the whole team). And if they can't admit that Tom Brady had **arguably** his worst season as a starter last year(obviously not counting his 2008-2009 season), then that is one of the worst cases of bias I've witnessed in a long time. That seriously competes with the LeBron James fans in the NBA who refuse to admit *he* declined last season.

Note: I'll agree that Tom Brady's apparent 111 ranking(I guess he got on this sub) is totally absurd. Clearly, he was a top 20 player last season, and arguably top 10. If that's what you're referring to with the ""Angry Pats Mob"", then you make a fair point.",nfl

"Do i really need to give reasoning on why Moss is better than Harrison? You got Moss for low picks because he gave up on the Raiders, Moss wasn't known for playing all out every season.  Then he showed what he still had from his Vikings day, and was pretty much every bit prime Moss.

Welker vs Wayne is a close one when looking at their overall careers, though Id say Welker edges Wayne out with 1 more 1st team All-Pro vs Wayne's 1 more Pro Bowl, as well as revolutionizing a new position in the 3 WR era.  Additionally an overall peak yardage in his career, though only by a little over 50 yards.  Though Wayne had better longevity, and more good not great seasons than Welker even if he was just under Welker's highs.

However, there is no comparison between 07 Welker and 04 Wayne. Welker was a 2nd team All-Pro behind two top 3 WRs all-time in Moss and TO.  Wayne was not, nor had ever been a Pro Bowler by 04, and had just gotten his first season over 1000 yards.

Stokley was, by far, a product of Manning with 04 easily being his career peak.  He never topped 700 receiving yards for the rest of his career, while getting 1k this season.  Before that season, he had never topped 400 yards.  He was quite clearly a product of Manning, and a low end WR2 at best for the rest of his career.  Stallworth was at least consistently a solid WR2 for a 4 year stretch, 767, 945, 725, and 697 yards in 4 consecutice years across 3 different teams.",nfl

Ooooh I like this one a lot but I think I would also throw Geno Atkins in the mix as well. Could you imagine how devastating our line would be? Granted it wouldn't make the steelers or ravens any worse but I think people are sleeping on the Bengals a little bit. I think they will at least end up closer to .500 than worse in the league.,nfl
"1. The reason the defense was so terrible last year was because of Sutton. The man absolutely refused to make any defensive changes during games. This was obvious during the AFCCG when Brady completed on 3rd and 10 three times in a row, two of them using almost the exact same route. A change at Defensive Coordinator is going to be the biggest boost to this team, even if it is Spags.

2. We went 4-3 after we lost Hunt including the playoffs, but the teams we lost to were Seattle at home, the Chargers, and the Patriots, which were all games that we could have lost at any time throughout the season. We actually averaged .4 more rushing yards per game during the regular season after we lost Hunt. The loss of Hunt has been mitigated.

3. Except for Drew Brees of course. He threw for over 5000 yards three years in a row. Brady also threw for 5200+ then turned around and threw for 4800+. Now I'm not saying Mahomes is Drew Brees or Tom Brady. But repeat seasons can, and have happened. Is it likely? No. But no one has had that kind of season at such a young age in over 30 years. As you said, it's an outlier of a season. We really have no reference for what will happen. It might. But it's far from a forgone conclusion.

4. That's true as well. Out of all the teams in the AFCW the Chargers have the easiest schedule. But I would say it about equals out when you factor in home field advantage for the Chiefs compared to the Chargers. The Chargers have very little home field advantage, whereas the Chiefs have one of the best home field advantages in the league. Not to mention the Chiefs/Chargers game that is being played in Mexico City is a home game for the Chargers. That means we get to play them once on a completely neutral field, and once in Arrowhead.

And I'm not saying your opinion is wrong. You have the right to your opinion. I was just trying to give some counterpoints to the ones you mentioned (albeit a little excitedly).",nfl

"They targeted gamers.

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods.

Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

"So I generally hate Trump's dealing with Iran, and I think if were serious about peace he'd immediately fire John Bolton, preferably out of a canon.

But when this guy was inaugurated, I promised to give him credit when he earned it. And this:

&gt; We were cocked &amp; loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when I asked, how many will die. 150 people, sir, was the answer from a General. 10 minutes before the strike I stopped it, not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone. I am in no hurry, our Military is rebuilt, new,  and ready to go, by far the best in the world.

That is pretty fucking refreshing to hear from a Republican President.

I'm hesitant to give Trump too much credit for not starting wars because that's sort of like praising a restaurant for not poisoning you. It's great, but it's also kinda the leas you can do. But an outright rejection of violence and using this language is unequivocally good.

Now he just needs to find a way to amp down pressure and start winding things down. He has a chance to salvage his terrible Iranian policy starting here, and I'm hoping that's the direction we move in.",nfl

"&gt;Opinions are opinions and should be taken with a grain of salt.

You can't make that blanket statement. Some opinions carry a lot of weight. Some don't. Depends on the subject and who's offering the opinion. 

I never said it's a gold standard. I said football isn't a stat you can narrow down to just objective stats. 150 yards is not 150 yards. 150 yards receiving is really good. 150 yards rushing is really good. 150 yards passing is bad. 150 yards on 2 plays is awesome. 150 yards on 30 plays is abysmal. 

Context is extremely important in football. And sometimes; often times even, that context is subjective. Nothing wrong with that. It's another piece of the larger puzzle. Doesn't mean you should take one other person's or outlet's opinion as gospel. You shouldn't. You shouldn't discount it either. 

That's my point. Completely ignoring something because you don't understand it is just willful ignorance. Ignorance is bliss though, I suppose.",nfl

But we don't have that luxury here. If Wentz goes down mid-season, we don't really have an option. I sure as hell hope the team is worrying about his injury history, and it's a perfectly fair worry to have. Our team this year looks like a superbowl contender again, that needs to be our goal.",nfl
"&gt;Posting everything will give us an idea what kind of mindset was the journalist is in what kind of mind set was the person being interviewed in. It gives context to the finished piece.

Beyond the practical/logistical issues, I actually don't think this is true. I agree that both reporters and subjects have biases, conscious and unconscious, but those manifest in the questions that are _not_ asked or answered. 

Put another way, this sort of transparency would prevent/catch bad actors who are deliberately misquoting or misconstruing their subjects, but that is not really where the problem lies in the vast majority of cases. To ferret out the kind of unconscious bias/agenda you have in mind, the reader would have to know more about the subject _and be less biased about the subject_ than the reporter. Both of those things are highly unlikely, if not impossible.

EDIT: As for the cons, the first major one is that it would make subjects much less willing to speak to reporters. The only reason people agree to an interview is that they have some level of trust that the reporter will do their best to accurately convey what they _mean_, not literally every word they say. An interview is a process of coming to that understanding — laying it all bare has a real chance of _obfuscating_ the context you're looking for in the weeds. The reason we have journalists in the first place is so they can do that work on our behalf.

And this is related to my earlier point, which is that even if you had the time/skill to essentially re-report a journalist's story from their notes and interviews — something that might have taken them hours, days, months, or years — how are you going to get around _your own_ biases to get to the real truth of the matter? 

That's not even factoring in the people who take those materials and intentionally apply their own biases to them for the express purposes of muddying the waters. We're already seeing this happen every day on social media and [actual Fake News sites in Macedonia](https://www.wired.com/2017/02/veles-macedonia-fake-news/). Real journalists generally don't do this because their jobs depend on their ability to get sources to trust them. When you have an army of bad actors whose jobs depend on their ability to trick people, that raw material is suddenly powerful ammo.

There's also cases where sources need to be anonymous for their own protection, or where there is context that reporters are granted access to under the condition it is not widely disseminated. 

And ultimately, if your concern is about journalists who are fundamentally untrustworthy and who intentionally distort their raw materials to push an agenda, why would you trust the accuracy of their notes or transcripts?",nfl
Does it surprise you Everett has not made an impact in the passing game? He’s entering year three and was picked in the second round. Compare that to a guy like Dallas Goedert who did some nice things his rookie year and would start on a team without Zach Ertz or Kelce (not an Eagles dan),nfl

I feel like if Hester was even remotely good at anything else he would have a great argument but does someone who touches the football like 4 times a game deserve to actually be in over guys who were the best at their positions and playing every down? I dont think so.   

Its not even so much of a matter of if he should be in is, who do you leave out to have this guy in, and is it fair to the guy playing at a HoF level 50 snaps a game to be snubbed for a guy who touches the ball 40 times a yr maybe.   

Also the way the rules are you will guarantee he will be the only KR in, because everyone just boots it out of the endzone. Until it becomes a penalty to kick it out of the back of the end zone, nobody else will even have a shot.

"1. He was ready to play and had a year left on his deal. He wouldve left and they wouldve got nothing so they traded him.

2. Basically they know what the defense does, so anticipating that they created plays that specifically work against the defense to get a player open. 

3. Knowing what players are likely to do. On the line this could mean foot placement alignment according to the offensive line. Basically being able to see where the defense is lined up and having a good idea of what each player is going to do. (I can go more in depth but this is the simple answer)

4. They knew they were in a rebuild. He is an amazing player but the value they could get was worth more in terms of building a team. Basically 1 elite player filling a hole vs having a chance to have 3 good players filling holes. 

5. So defensive players still have responsibilities. How they guard the offense, are they rushing the passer or defending the run. Are the corners and safeties playing man (1 on 1 with a player) or zone (covering a specific area of the field). Linebackers typically are called the QB of the defense, they are in the middle of the field and are often the smartest player on the defense.",nfl

You are making my point for me and at the same time killing your own. ""Wildly different coordinators"" and the same result, gee I wonder what player contributes the most to having steady, uninterrupted offensive production no matter the TE, RB, WR, LT, or OC.

With two picks a round or chain picks it was easy to get them before the second or third round, and many would then be stuck with second-tier QBs and would usually be wanting one by Weeks 3-4. 

Not that I still don’t get lucky on it from time to time, but it can be a crapshoot and sometimes it isn’t worth it.",nfl
"Joe Flacco is a bottom 10 starting QB. His numbers over the past 4 years bear that out. Also, our best receiver is coming off an Achilles injury, we have major question marks in the interior of the oline, and all our TEs are either very young or injury prone.

On defense, we have issues at both ILB spots, boundary corner opposite CHJ, nose tackle, and we don't have any game changers in the DL (hopefully Shelby Harris is that)

BTW, expecting an entire new coaching staff to come in and hit the ground running in the first year is just not realistic, especially against teams like the Chargers and Chiefs, who have had their coaching infrastructure in place for years. There are going to be hiccups.

Winning the division (or even making the playoffs) this year is just unrealistic. We have too many holes and question marks, NTM the difficult schedule. I have us at 7-9/8-8.",nfl
"Finding something you can tolerate for work is a good thing, I know I'm not out there pushing myself hard or in a place that doesn't sit well, so good on you for finding that out!

""For some reason that I have yet to understand, few other coaches seem to try his strategies.""

They try to avoid bias in the grades by having 2 independent people do them and then have the differences reviewed but grading isn't objective no matter what measures you take. If you goal is determining if the course of action was ""right"" you need to have definitions of what right is and you'll have differences in interpretation of the play as well.",nfl
"I still see the running game being big but I think Harris and Burkhead will eat a lot into the carries. If Hill hadn’t gotten hurt last year I think he would have taken like 30% of Michels snaps.

"So? All you're talking about is stats. The AFC East defenses have been much better than the NFC South defenses on average, it's just their offense is usually inept.

If anything, the ""coach made him"" argument is stronger against Brees than Brady.",nfl
"It's become over dramatized hugely by Broncos fan and made into some real life Disney story where Demarcus Ware swooped in and saved his career.

The notion that he may not have gotten a 2nd contract is completely ridiculous, Von had some immaturity issues but he was never seen as someone who was a bad locker room influence, or a headcase who wasn't worth the talent ala Aldon Smith. He's always been loved by teammates.",nfl
"I think we're talking about different things. Is he good compared to every wide receiver in the NFL, even practice squad guys who don't appear on game days and whose names aren't even known among most fans of their teams? Sure, if we want to change the subject and the entire point of this discussion, we could technically call him good. But I don't think that's what anyone is talking about in this context, so I can't help but wonder what the point is in bringing it up.

Roethlisberger made him a Pro Bowler, the Dolphins gave him one of the biggest contracts for a WR in NFL history hoping he could recreate some of that with Tannehill, but instead they traded him just two years into that 5 year deal. In the NFL, I believe that they usually refer to that kind of performance leading to that kind of sequence of events as ""not good"".",nfl
"This is what I'm talking about with the decent gap thing. I don't think its meant as an insult to anyone but I don't think there's a decent gap between any of those guys. I would put Wilson at 4 or 5 and no lower than 6, and I could even see an argument for #3 but I think people ignore the sheer amount of sacks he takes and fumbles he has when saying he's undoubtably the 4th best QB after guys like Brady Brees and Rodgers. Its also a bit off imo to say Wilson is markedly better than Ryan when the best season between the two of them is easily Ryans, and they have both had similar success the last few years. Wilson is more consistent, but Ryan has one of the highest ceilings in the league. Just last year I think there's an argument for any of Wilson, Ryan, Luck, and Rivers to occupy the #3-#6 spots after Mahomes and Brees, and I wouldn't fault anyone for putting those guys in any order for their 2018 performance, and that's not touching on Rodgers and Brady who both had down years by their standards, or Roethlisberger, or even guys like Goff and Wentz who performed at a high level.",nfl

"Duke Johnson has gotten more playing time than White and more yards from scrimmage. He's also way less efficient, a much worse pass protector, and has fumbled 8 times compared to White's zero despite playing one less year.

1. Ryan or Watson is my guess

They'll explain away Luck's positioning because he had an incredible season if you throw away his first 6 games. Yea, no fucking shit, if you throw away the worst 38% of someone's stats they'll look good. Ryan or Watson over Brady isn't even worth the argument but this upcoming Luck explanation is what I live for.",nfl
"Yeah but at least now it's young talent. Elflein two years ago, who is now moving back to his natural position at Guard thanks to drafting Bradbury in the 1st round this year. O'Neill was drafted in the 2nd last year and didn't give up a single sack at RT.

The same is true of Bradshaw.  27,989 career passing yards.  212 touchdown passes.  220 interceptions. Not impressive at all, statistically.  But he and his team dominated the 1970s.

Kyzir White. He was injured most of the season. But those first 3 games he looked like the best player of last years draft. Which is crazy because he was a safety we moved to linebacker.

It was classic for John Fox to have a good December after we would start out like 1-6. Matt Moore had some pretty good games that year. It was Favre’s good Vikings season and we played them at home on a Sunday night and Matt Moore outplayed him and we won. Only time I saw Favre in person.,nfl

Amsterdam Admirals game played out the new Olympic stadium. They played in that stadium before it got renovated.

"That was a mistake on my part but I honestly didn't recall the Ravens rushing attack being god-awful before Jackson. It boomed with Jackson entering at QB as he was getting a ton of rush yards on his own. I also said I counted the turnaround on the rushing game for something, my point on the elite defense still stands. My point about the sample size of games played by Jackson vs Darnold, Allen, and Baker, still stands. And my opinion on putting him above Darnold also still stands. I think Darnold was better than Jackson. Not way better, just better.  


Edit: But the issue that spawned from Jackson is that the ravens were TERRIBLY one dimensional because Jackson wasn't a reliable asset as a passer. If he couldn't run wild like he wanted to, the Ravens were offensively ineffective.",nfl

"Look, I know Callahan is a magic worker, but going from Trent to, well, not Trent is going to objectively hurt the offense, full stop.

Even if Trent's not the best run blocker in the world, if we have to start Geron or some other unproven guy at LT, then we're going to see a lot more pressure on the blind side of Haskins/Keenum, which will hurt the passing game, which will in turn hurt the ground game. 

As for Trent coming back, I'm still worried about that whole rumor about him saying he refuses to play in DC. I know that some people have said that they don't think that it's true and that this is purely a money matter, but we've gotten nothing definitive from Trent, his agent, or the FO on the matter. If it's just about money, fine, pay the man. But if it's more than that (which it very well could be), then money might not be enough.",nfl
"Sure, I’m not saying it wouldn’t be bad, it would be, but I just think it’s way too soon to say for sure what would happen in terms of overall offensive production, that’s all. I think it’s possible someone develops, or we trade for someone, or who knows what. As for the Trent rumors, I think it’s totally possible he did vow to not play here again, while at the same time, calming down to the tune of an extra 5 or 10 million guaranteed. People get mad and say shit all the time, but ultimately, I think he’ll be back.

"I'd counter that for RB you mentioned McCoy is aging and filled his spot with Frank Gore, who is 6 years older. Gore has been a hell of an endurance option and it's a marvel he continues to produce at his age but if age is a question for McCoy, it's significantly more so for Gore. RBs hit a age wall a lot faster than most and Gore is one injury away from being done probably (it get's much harder to recover from injury at that age). Injuries at RB happen quite frequently so I'm not sold on him continuing to be the iron man he has been. That said, he's proved us all wrong year after year the last 6 or so years, and he could certainly do it again, I just wouldn't consider it a certainty. 

When it comes to Josh Allen, I just wonder how well he can be developed by the Bills. They haven't truly developed a project QB in a long, long time. Dorsey was the QB coach for the Panthers as Cam was coming into the league but I really don't think Cam can be compared to Josh Allen as Cam was more a finished product coming into the league and didn't need to be more thoroughly developed (not to mention his skill set was never focused on being a pure passer and has only one season where his passing was above average). Sean McDermott is a defensive HC, and the offensive coordinator's most notable experience is being the OC for Bama, another notoriously not QB-centric program. It's not that I think Josh Allen can't be developed into a solid NFL QB, I just question whether the Bills are equipped to do that.",nfl
"This is partially on Watson and the scheme though too. He is a mobile guy that can evade pressure, and has one of the longer times to throw in the league. This is a good thing, do the get me wrong. Guys like Rogers, Maholms and Wilson all have longer times to throw. Allows time for the play to develop and receivers to beat their guy and targets downfield, gaining more yards per completion.

But, while being mobile bails your oline out to some extent, it also means they have more time to get beat by the pass rush per play, meaning more sacks and hits",nfl
Yeah we have a good line but Mahomes makes them look much better than they actually are. He is really good at getting the ball out right before he’s hit. A good example of this was his first touchdown pass to Tyreek Hill. He took a huge shot but was somehow able to get the ball out at the last second. I think this is one of his most overlooked strengths.,nfl
"It's because they add so much language to each rule... And refs are thinking through a whole process... They need to just rewrite the rules and write them simple. No 1a, 1b, 1c. Just a rule.

"Most games would include 40 combined run plays if not more by both teams. And if you it was a high scoring pass oriented game youd be looking at maybe 50 attempts combined for both QBs as a big number lol 

On defence, again lots of emphasis on run defence and hard hits alot of hard heavy hits. 

Alot of thicc boys on both sides of the ball. Linebackers were heavier, dline and oline heavier. 

Not saying there was less athleticism cus that would be 100% wrong, but there was more of a value of strength and big beasts than now. 

Overall was still 10/10 quality football, but u were looking at teams being committed to running the ball 20+ times a game and defences being alot more geard to stop the run.

Shotgun was rarer than it was now. Again, was still used but alot less. U had alot more of the qb playing right under center. 

Every team had a fullback lol 

And nickel corner was not a thing and u needed 100% 3 linebackers Whereas now, u dont need the 3 LBs as much and u absolutely need 3 corners more often. 

90s OFFENCES : run heavy offences focused on PA and some passing. 
90s DEFENCES : geared to stop the run, blitz more often and alot of nasty and hard hits evrry game from everywhere lol.

"There is no sane argument that shows Luck was obviously better last season. It was very close. PFF had Luck at #3, Brady was #4. DYAR had Luck slighty higher, DVOA had Brady slightly higher. Both were equally unlucky with interceptions according to FO.

Stat | Luck | Brady
---- | ---- | ----
CMP% | 67.3 | 65.8
Yards | 4593 | 4355
TD | 39 | 29
TD% | 6.1 | 5.1
INT | 15 | 11
INT% | 2.3 | 1.9
FUM | 6 | 4
Y/A | 7.2 | 7.6
ANY/A | 6.95 | 7.26
Rating | 98.7 | 97.7

So by every statistic, they are quite close. Even their supporting casts are quite close, although I'd give a slight edge to Brady. But that's offset by the fact that Luck gets to play home games in a dome and Brady plays outside in NE.

You want to argue Luck had a better season? Perfectly acceptable. But ""obviously better"" and ""it wasn't even that close""? That's too far, by every argument I can see they're quite close.

I think Jones will get an extension if Tyreek Hill doesn't agree to one.

The Tyreek situation remains in flux, but I could see him getting a couple of games for the menacing comment on the audio.

I think the $200 million mark is a milestone any good agent could negotiation from.

"OK, so in the NHL the players are entitled to a percentage of hockey-related revenue - I believe 50%.  The salary cap is based on dividing that (projected) amount by the 31 teams to determine a number called the ""midpoint"" and then adding and subtracting a number to get to the ceiling/cap and the floor.

IF team spending averaged exactly that midpoint, the players would get exactly their share.  But that's not really achievable so some salary money goes into escrow throughout the season and at the end of the season the league calculates whether the players were paid too much or not enough and money goes one way or the other (this ALWAYS results in escrow money going back to the teams for a couple of reasons).

So yeah, both teams did play Clarkson's and Horton's salaries even though they were both on LTIR.  And they were allowed to exceed the cap because of that LTIR money.  But every dollar still counted toward the player's share of hockey-related revenue and pushed the players farther into the excess, so that just increases the amount that the owners get back from escrow.  Doesn't mean the Blue Jackets and Maple Leafs specifically got back the amount they paid those guys, but it was distributed back to the owners.

And that's why owners don't mind so much things that let them exceed the cap but they DO NOT WANT any money paid to players *outside* of that player's share of HRR.",nfl

I just assumed you were west coast based where a 7:15 game could be considered night (I guess). 

Then you somehow switched Sunday Night from meaning 4:15 EST to meaning 8:15 EST. So you moved the goalposts and then, despite me being 100% consistent, accused me of doing it.

Tell you what, when you referred to the Late Sunday game as being a Sunday Night game, why don't you tell me what you were referring to? What time do you think they happened? And why, if a 4:15 is a night game in the playoffs, isn't it a night game in the regular season?",nfl
"http://www.grammarunderground.com/should-you-put-a-comma-before-too-either-or-also.html

&gt;When they come midsentence, the commas don’t seem quite as expendable. Changing “I, too, saw the accident” to “I too saw the accident” creates a weird and perhaps momentarily confusing relationship between the adverb and the verb that follows. But these commas don’t seem quite as common as they once were, either.

&gt;Turns out that, as austere comma use continues to be the fashion, commas setting off “too” and similar adverbs are less important.

&gt;How do you know whether to use them? Well, many experts point out that the comma before a “too” or “either” can give it extra emphasis, setting it off from the pack and letting it stand alone. By skipping the comma, you deemphasize the “too” by integrating it into the sentence.

&gt;If you’re looking for a guideline, use the comma when you want the extra emphasis. Otherwise, skip it. Me, I find that old habits die hard. I’ll continue to use commas before “too,” “also,” and “either” whenever possible.

Weird how things that a lot of people assume are hard-and-fast ""grammatical rules"" are, in fact, style choices!

His skill is decent too. 

As for ascending to Duke of Aquitaine, I think this is proving difficult because I chose the Charlemagne start and everybody has gavelkind succession so that's complicating things a bit. Also, the dynasty that had the duchy nailed down has more or less disappeared and the succession line is all fucked up.

"You'll probably have this thread removed, but here's general advice.

Jog for general good cardio health, but [HIIT](https://greatist.com/fitness/interval-training-beginners#1) is what you want for true football shape though. You can do this on the treadmill, or on spin bikes, but simply running outside is probably best. You can modulate it however you want. The overall goal is to keep intensity at near max for bursts of time, between longer, lower intensity periods.

You're not going to be running long distances in-game, you're going to be using major bursts of energy that are anaerobic and aerobic at the same time.  

Don't overly focus on some of the things high-schoolers tend to - like bench and curls. If you want to get in fucking amazing shape and hit cardio and strength of core muscled at the same time - find a used copy of some shit like P90X or Insanity or something. I've done a few rounds of it - it feels a bit awkward - but holy shit your body feels amazing after even a month of it. It will feel like a train hit you the first week though. 

In terms of learning the sport, do you play xbox or anything? Buy last year's edition of Madden. Play the shit out of it. You'll learn a ton of basic concepts that way. You can also watch some beginner videos on YouTube as well. Additionally, find a friend who does play madden, or watches a lot of football, and ask them questions. 

Depending on the position you end up playing, you may want to focus in on more of the details of that particular position. Based on your current size and age, you really could go any number of ways positionally. 

Have fun with it though, and good luck!",nfl

I’m bullish on one, because many people have pointed out similarities in Chubb and Mack’s game and Mack just had a stellar year with Fangio. Health, who knows.

I'm in my second career, right now. I work in sales in a big ol' tech company and, honestly, it's a great place to work. It has all those kind of cool, fun accouterments and workplace atmosphere that people associate with big tech companies. I work with a ton of people my age and I make good money with immediate prospects to make a *lot* more money. Moreover I'm *damn* good, like, objectively the best in my department at my grade, at what I do which gives me a ton of morale and validation. Working here also allows me to live in this city that I love so damn much, and to enjoy it without my job intruding into my life more than the bare minimum.

Buuuuuuuuuuuuut I used to work in electoral politics. It was hard, it was unforgiving, I worked loads and loads and loads of overtime. I made substantially less money. I worked with a lot of really awful, opportunistic, cynical people who didn't give a shit about, like, what we were doing in a broader sense. Careerists, I guess? It was really tough and not very often super rewarding. But I had a sense of mission and got to work on things that mattered and made a difference to society. I worked for officials who had vision and who were doing or trying to do good things for my society. It was also what I went to school for and what I always assumed I'd do professionally. And not doing, seeing others I worked with succeeding in doing that still, getting reminders of it and knowing that it's probably too late for me to ever go back at this point because I'd have to start all over again, really fucking hurts sometimes. It was, generally, a shitty racket and I hated a lot of it a lot of the time. So 'missing' it seems stupid to me, logically.

"&gt; The cap hit is completely 100% entirely unchanged. He is literally on the same deal for two more seasons.

No he's not, the new contract completely changed the salary and bonus amounts he received the next two seasons. His cap hits in 2019 and 2020 actually went down in the new contract.

&gt; That however says nothing about his value once the rookie money ends, and the extension money takes over. Averaging the two together does not make any sense whatsoever if you’re trying to quantify the value of his four-year extension. 

Why not? When teams sign players early, the AAV is lower than it otherwise would be. That's the tradeoff -- you guarantee guys early, and down the line the AAV and/or cap hit looks cheap. That's how the Eagles and many teams build their rosters.

&gt; Okay, just FYI, Carson Wentz’s new contract literally set the record for largest guaranteed salary in NFL history.

Technically with injury guarantees yes, but in general no.

I agree with that. He's the best kick returner but people forget thats a very limited role.

At the end of the season there is a sense of urgency that is just not present at the start of the season and I don't know how you keep arguing otherwise.

You keep trying to equate all the games as the same based on a technicality that they are all the same in the standings. While it is technically true, you just keep ignoring the context of the wins and loses.

Ryan only ""stepped up"" in those games after he was down 2 scores in most of them and then proceeded to lose those games by 2 scores, essentially just padding stats in garbage time. The opposing defenses just lightened up a little to give the Falcons an opportunity to put inconsequential points on the board.

Commissioner could place you on his exempt list indefinitely while this was being appealed, kind of like what happened to AP, so you take the punishment in order to get back on the field quicker.

No, they didn't. This is not KCPD jurisdiction, this is Johnson County, and more to the point, Overland Park (OPPD). 

KCK and KCMO PD has nothing to do with any of this. 

&gt;Yes, allegedly there was non-cooperation. Its not confirmed but it has at least been reported. Pure willful ignorance there.

The alleged ""non-cooperation"" you speak of, is in reference to the child who will not say who hurt him. That was literally in the 4/24 statement, the same one you're going on about that ""KCPD"" supposedly said a crime was committed, but was actually the Johnson County prosecutor's office, after the OPPD investigation turned up no evidence to charge anyone with, which was a follow up to the report in which Tyreek wasn't at the residence for, the one which you can read from KCTV5's errant report that showed ""battery"" and listed *ONLY* Crystal, and the victim being the Child. 

&gt;The chest punching was brought up in the context of a conversation. Any reasonable person would put two and two together there.

The child has a broken arm, not a broken rib, clavicle, injured sternum, or collar bone. I'm not sure where you come from, but where I come from if you get punched in the chest, its not going to break your arm. Having said that, in the audio he makes it clear that it isn't a hard punch the chest, and I believe called them ""Daps"" or whatever. Very likely to be similar to how I ""punch"" my nephew in the chest in a playful manner. The audio, also, isn't to be taken as gospel. Its clear he wasn't aware of the recording, and despite it being legal in Dubai to do so, would not be legal here. Beyond that, the 11 minute audio clip, not the edited 7 minute clip (From KCTV and The Kansas City Star, how ironic) suggests the entirety of the conversation was not done around the child, and had a lot more to do with their relationship. You listen to the whole thing and tell me again with a clean conscience she wasn't trying to set him up down the line for a custody battle or child support while he comes into his new contract. You won't. I mean, you might as a Chargers fan go down that road, but nobody with half a brain is going to follow that path. 

&gt; Its clear she's not talking about some goofy game they play. 

I disagree entirely, what is clear, however, is that she's trying to use that as a ""setup"" to catch him on an audio tape as ""insurance"" when they break up and she needs to file child support against him and his new contract. She immediately brings up him being scared of Tyreek right after it, trying to get him to admit something, anything, and he doesn't. 


&gt;Not too mention its pretty inappropriate at all to be punching a toddler in the chest regardless of the severity. 

Do you have kids? Nieces and Nephews? I've literally punched my nephew in the chest a thousand times, not hard of course, and he pretends to fall down, then I ""check on him"" and he sucker punches me, and I pretend to fall down. 

The girl is being investigated for Munchausen by Proxy, which quite literally mean she makes shit up about her son for attention. I'm not buying that audio tape one bit. 

&gt;I think I'm done discussing this here. I've read some of your other comments. I know you've probably been told this a lot lately because of your attitude towards child abuse but I find you pretty disgusting.

I'm not sure where you think I have any attitude towards child abuse. I obviously don't condone it, but I'm also not going to sit here and assume a man's guilt when its clear there's no evidence and likely quite a bit more to the story on Crystal's part that isn't being said. 

Don't take my word for it, take the fucking prosecutors office for it. Take the police departments word for it. Take DCF's investigation **INTO CRYSTAL** for it. 

Don't try to turn this out like I'm a bad guy for telling you fucks to slow your biased judgements against him for something that is quite clear, wasn't his doing. 

If there was a single shred of evidence here even suggested Tyreek had any involvement or knowledge of, he'd have been charged, and immediately released by the Chiefs. 

The fact that this hasn't happened, even after that audio tape, says they have probably already seen the tapes I spoke about, because after the Kareem Hunt deal, Brett and Clark have a less than zero policy against conduct like this as a Chief.",nfl

"I did find this:

  [https://www.footballoutsiders.com/info/FO-basics](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/info/FO-basics) 

&gt;Clearly, NFL teams have figured the importance of the Shotgun out for themselves. In 2001, NFL teams only used Shotgun on 14 percent of plays. Five years later, in 2006, that had increased slightly, to 20 percent of plays. Shotgun usage has risen steadily since then, shattering the halfway point in 2013 (when NFL teams used Shotgun 59 percent of the time) and then creeping over the 60 percent threshold in 2014. Before 2007, no team had ever used Shotgun on more than half its offensive plays. In 2014, 26 different teams used Shotgun over 50 percent of the time, led by Philadelphia which used Shotgun on an NFL-record 86 percent of plays. (That was actually a very slight decline for Philadelphia, from 86.0 percent in 2013 to 85.6 percent last year.) It is likely that if teams continue to increase their usage of the Shotgun, defenses will adapt and the benefit of the formation will become less pronounced. But it certainly isn't happening yet; the difference between success on Shotgun and non-Shotgun plays in 2001 was bigger than in 2008, 2009, or 2010.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Pro Football Prospectus 2007*, Tampa Bay chapter

&amp;#x200B;

I think what we may be seeing is an *over-adoption* of the shotgun.  Also interesting that the statement ""Shotgun formation plays are more successful than non-Shotgun formation plays"" is still true... but when you look at *only the passing plays* it is patently false.  The only reason the original statement rings true is because teams elect to run the ball so frequently from under center.",nfl

Wade came in and made him FS, which looked genius after year 1 but he regressed last year.

"Well last year he was injured most of the year. His injury concerns date back to college.

But even in his first year, his YPA just weren't that great. He would get like 2 yards a rush and then break off maybe 1 big, long rush to up his average. 

This can be explained away by the fact that he's facing 8 man boxes all the time and a lot of teams just knew we were going to run. But, idk. To me he sort of lacks the vision of some other RB. The Jags are pretty spoiled with RBs because we've had two phenomenal ones in our short history.

When Mojo was around, he would also face 8 man boxes. Garrard wasn't seen as that big of a passing threat and we were primarily a running team. Yet, it seemed like Mojo would always be good for 4 yards, at least. Plus the occasional home run like Lenny gets. Not to mention, Fred Taylor was one of the best as well...

To me it seems like Fournette just tries to bulldoze over everyone like he did in college, however that doesn't really work in the NFl anymore. 

So, if you really watched the Jags his rookie season, he didn't seem to have it like Fred or Mojo. He'd get the home run every now and again but otherwise it'd be 2 yards and that's it, rather than 4 yards that Mojo and Fred always seemed good for.

Also,he seems to have some behavior issues. Idk what the story is with that, but he's already been suspended for a game by the team. He punches opposing players on tge field, idk.

I really don't want another top ten bust. We've had way too many of those this past decade. But I see him being another Trent Richardson. Or I could see him having more injury issues...issues that have plagued him in college and his first two years in the league.

This is an important season for him. We have more of a threat with the passing attack,so it should free up space for Fournette. I hope he has a great year because I'm seriously sick of busting on high picks. However I suspect je may get injured or get suspended at some point this season and I wouldn't be shocked.",nfl

"I think the defense will be better for a few reasons:

\- Much more depth at LB: The biggest shortcoming of our defense in 2018 was that it had very shit depth at linebacker. We lost White early in the season, and once Perryman went down the position was pretty much toast. This got particularly exposed when we had to go into New England. Adding Thomas Davis and 2 draft picks to the mix should help this a lot. Hopefully Kyzir White and Nwosu can also take a step forward in year 2. This is the most confident I've felt about the Chargers LB core in a long time.

\- We added an actual FS: To say Jahleel Addae was a liability there last year is an understatement. He was one of the slowest starting DB's in the game last year. He ran a 4.6. We drafted Adderley in the second round who is a legit center fielder who can run a 4.4. I think you can really see the true cover 3 type of scheme that Bradley likes to run.

\- Having Bosa back and at 100%: Even when Bosa played last year he was still not at 100%. Reportedly the foot injury kept him from doing most of his training, so once the foot got better he was pretty out of football shape. Expect him to be back in football shape and ready to give opposing QB's nightmares.

&amp;#x200B;

The 2018 defense was good but it actually took a pretty decent step back from the 2017 defense because of the reasons I just listed. This current defense is a lot more talented than the 2017 defense was and I expect it to be among the elite defenses in the league.",nfl
"Not necessarily a bust, but Jay Cutler in Denver was on a completely different trajectory than he was in Chicago.

He certainly has his own faults for why his career turned out how it did, but I’ve still never seen a QB have absolutely everything around him get as fucked up like I have Cutler.

"If it hits the stanchion first before anything, and then immediately doinks right back out the way it came and onto the field?

"Because until his very last season he couldn't  ever have an off day in the playoffs, and he was so far and away the most valuable player that he was studied and gameplanned for more than anyone else.


I might get ripped to shreds for this but let's check out some Tom Brady winning QB performances in the playoffs:

* Won his first CCG and SB with exactly 245  total yards of offense, 1 TD, and 1 INT total on 51 pass plays **combined**

* Beat the Chargers back to back years with a total of 4 TDs, 6 Ints, 1 Fumble, 475 yards of total offense on 92 total plays

* Beat the Ravens on 1 TD, 2 Ints, and 236 yards on 43 plays

* CCG  and Super Bowl this past season, where he had 1 TD and   3 INTs with a fumble between them and fairly average yards per play.

It's not that great of a sample size but both Peyton and Brady have times when they've choked big time in the playoffs with different results. 

That  being said, Manning also had times where he blatantly choked and it didn't matter because his team  won. You could argue neither of his SB wins were well deserved in the context of his whole career, but being on a better team just brought him there. It's the way it goes.

Conversely you can't say Brady didn't ""deserve"" a ring for  2017.  It's his best postseason of his career by far IMHO and he didn't win.",nfl
"I wouldn’t say 6-3 is “greatly overachieving”, that’s a good record but we went 3-4 in those games in 2017 and we finished with the highest point differential in the league last season, so I think it’s fair to say we aren’t relying on winning a lot of nail biters to have a good record. Unger also clearly lost a step last season, although he was still a very solid center who we’ll miss.

That said, I don’t see another 13-3 and I’m not sure if we’ll be back in the NFC championship. I think we have the team to do it but it’s very hard to be able to repeat the kind of success we had last season.",nfl

"&gt;be honest, how many raiders games have you watched? 

Games? None. All-22 film of every play Amari was on the field? All of them. This is where the disconnect is. People watching on TV can't see what Amari is doing because they don't show you. All most fans do is check their fantasy scores or watch on gameday and complain. This isn't a RB, it's a WR. You have no idea how they're actually performing if they're not getting the ball, unless you watch the coach's film. 

&gt;your bias is clearly showing if you're trying to defend this play. triple covered sure but uhm he had them all beat and he gave up on the route. 

Bias toward what? Not cherry picking plays that aren't representative? 

&gt;why can you only give examples of 2018 when we had a brand new coaching staff, huge turnover, and a brand new playbook? you do know we had cooper prior to 2018 as well right?

Amari had a brand new coach, staff, huge turnover and brand-new playbook when he went to the Cowboys. The only difference is his target share doubled in Dallas that year. If anything you're making the point that the splits in 2018 between Oakland and Dallas are comparable and shouldn't be ignored. 

And I don't bring up the other years because Amari was great those years. Two 1k seasons in his first two years, at his young age, is an incredible pace. That dropped considerably in 2017, but so did his targets. He only had 96 targets in 2017, that's 41st in the league that year. Even accounting for the fact that Amari missed two games, that's still not good. That's even worse when you consider that NINETEEN of those 96 targets came from just one game, where he put up 200+ yards. His per-game targets were abysmal when you control for that.

Even if you want to say Amari was bad in 2017, that's one season following two exceptional rookie and sophomore campaigns. Essentially giving up on him and phasing him out of the offense over that is bad.",nfl

"Let spell it out for you since you're having trouble following. That recommdation may have been because they can't prove anything. However, that's not the end all be all for the NFL. If they felt there was something there as an employer they had the right to suspend him any way to protect their brand. The lead investigator and the commissioner are going to have a different outlook due to the nature of the commissioners job. 

The festival is further evidence that he can't control himself. And while it obviously had no bearing on the suspension decision, seeing as it hadn't happened yet, it does continue a pattern of behavior that lends more credibility to the accusations. Making it look less like bullshit in hindsight.

If you can't see why behavior that would get you fired from most job, and it most definitely would, might lead to a suspension in the NFL then I don't know what to tell you. Most job offers come with some sort of code if ethics, whether formally presented or informally, that are expected to be followed on and off the job.

What if they could actually get a good return for bell because the contract would be cheaper for the new team with the amount of money the Jets would have to pay him?

Not saying the jets were purposefully trying this but what if a team with a lot of cap space and not very many players to extend tried to sign free agents then immediately trade them. The team with a lot of cap space takes a big dead money hit but gets a solid return in picks from a win now team that wants a few years of a cheap (to them) proven skill position player.

"Ohh I misinterpreted, my B.

Yeah I think it’s a possibility but I think it’s exaggerated. The big personalities are baker, OBJ and Jarvis. As I see it the only real problem is arguments over target share, but that seems unlikely because 1) they’re really tight and 2) they have previously played together extensively. 

Baker has been the first to take blame when he doesn’t play well, so it’s not like we’ll get an Eli/OBJ-esque problem. And we didn’t have any problems last year when we lost multiple games in a row or when Baker played poorly. I’d argue early last year was far worse situation when we had the dumpster fire of a coaching staff.",nfl

"&gt; This also goes beyond the period where Brady had his terrible supporting casts, and although Manning still has the advantage in receiving weapons, Brady had the better overall OL besides the downtick when Scar left in 2015 and Brady got fucked.

The OLs are debatable. The Colts weren't shabby and while the Pats OL has never been flat out bad for a full season it hasn't been *great* as often as people think it has.

Also the dome effect matters and people usually forget to consider it (or just choose not to because it's hard to weigh).

- For his career Peyton had a 7.96 AY/A and a 99.1 rating in a dome.

- For his career Peyton had a 7.38 AY/A and a 94.0 rating outdoors.

Peyton put up better numbers in domes. His case is a bit messy though because he had more outdoor games in his Denver days. Different teams, different eras. But we see the same case with Brady:

- Brady has a 9.10 AY/A and a 109.0 rating in domes.

- Brady has a 7.73 AY/A and a 96.9 rating outdoors.

For Brady more than half his outdoor games are home games. All of his dome games are road games. You really wouldn't expect to see this sort of split based on that if domes didn't matter for passing numbers.

You see this for *most* (but not quite all) large sample size great QBs. Ryan's efficiency numbers are better in domes. Rodgers' efficiency numbers are better in domes even though they're all road games. Eli's efficiency numbers are better in domes even though they're all road games. Big Ben's efficiency numbers are better in domes even though they're all road games. Each of those guys saw *significantly* better efficiency numbers in domes, too. These weren't close calls. 

Manning's numbers for '03-'14 are better than Brady's in '07-'18 in substantial part because of the dome effect.",nfl

"My above breakdown wasn't supposed to be a be-all end-all. If anything it was supposed to show that having only three divisions wouldn't work great. Like that NFC Central is death while that NFC East would give Philly an almost guaranteed playoff spot (also going off the ""take the top two division teams"" thing) for the next 3-4 years. Parity would be really messed up. 

I can't speak too much for the AFC, but in the NFC, I think the divisions are prefect as-is. Geographically, the only weird one is Dallas, but if everyone is happy with it in the East, I'm good with that. 

Just sampling the current NFC divisions: 

The NFC North is all geographically close and historic. The Vikings are the baby here only starting out in '61. This is the black and blue division where every team hates the Packers, the Packers hate the Bears, the Packers and Bears look down on the Vikings for being proud of being good but having no rings and the Lions are doing their best. I think it would be insane to mess with that. The only team that maybe could get added in would be a St. Louis franchise as there is a gulf of AFC Teams surrounding the NFC North on all sides. But really, no other team could hop in there and feel like they belong. 

The NFC East hates each other more than anyone else. Between the NFC North and East, the NFC may just be hateful people. These guys *need* to beat the shit out of each other or they might explode. You could maybe try to peel off Dallas, but it wouldn't be the same. Adding another team would just feel weird. I can't expect the Eagles to hate the Panthers as much as the Giants, for example. It's just not gonna happen. 

The NFC South is a bit weaker, really just being a showdown between Atlanta and New Orleans (who gave a great rivalry between themselves) the last couple years, but the Panthers are all in with this identity, too. Unlike the AFC South, this really is the South and it's got a cool vibe to the division. Tampa frankly is bad, but we already went over why it wouldn't make sense to put them in the East or North so unless they are gonna fly out west constantly, keep them where they are. Also bad teams can still have great rivalries (read: Browns) that are one of the few things that actually can get fans pumped up when their team isn't doing well. 

And the NFC West is geographically well placed and with the Rams moving recently, things are a bit more open here, you probably could throw in a San Diego expansion and make it feel right (though I think if there is a San Diego expansion it would have to play the Changers twice a year). Portland could work, too, though. This is probably the least rivalrous division in the NFC, but they are all very close and all very competitive (except the Cards) and we can't try to put those teams anywhere else. 

The AFC could probably live with a reshuffling, but leave the NFC the way it is. I think it's great and couldn't be better.



Edit: this is really long. It boils down to: Rivalries keep people interested and we watch this game for the entertainment and stories. Rivalries are a big part of that and divisions should emphasize that and geographic continuity (but mainly rivalries).",nfl

I think that some guarantees for injury may be acceptable, but tying up salary cap space for an under-performing player will hurt team performance/ fans.",nfl
"How does the point not still stand? The point is that WRs are tricky to transition into the pros. Sure it had a strange cutoff at 19 WRs, but whether they included Cooks and OBJ or not, the point still stands.

I'm just gonna say Fitz because he's a legit legend on and off the field all around good guy and MBC although talented is just a batshit crazy primadonna that will eventually be put in his place and that will always tarnish his reputation. There's a lot to be said for guys like Fitz just legit good people that make everyone they play with better people.,nfl
"Except when you saw him this season, you saw a guy with noticeably dimished arm strength, diminished pocket awareness to evade pressure inside the pocket, and a more extreme than usual overreliance on short pass plays to gain yardage. There's a reason why the Patriots were pounding defenses using the run game and quick pass plays to a HB/TE/ edelman most of the time.",nfl
"Man, I think the comparisons are where people gets so hung up in this discussion on D.K. 

Does he obviously have some athletic and physical traits that are comparable to some of the best the league has seen? Yeah, I do think that is arguable, his size/speed/physicality is absolutely special. That's why we make these comparisons, because we need someone that we can point to to say that he fits into this mould that other players have done well in.

But I dont think anyone is seriously suggesting that he is exactly the same prospect as Randy Moss or Megatron, or that he will absolutely have the same kind of productive NFL career or stats or highlight reels as those guys.  And if they are, then you're spending too much time on hot-take twitter that condenses real football scouting and analysis into the character limit. Wide receiver is notoriously hard to scout, and there are way more misses in early round picks than there are hits in terms of guys just being consistent producers, let alone become all time greats. Even if he was exactly the same prospect as those guys, a LOT has to fall into place to give you the kind of careery they had.  

But, as small of a percentage as it may be, I think with his tools it's within the range of possible outcomes for D.k. ie) His absolute ceiling for production if everything falls in place.

Now, realistically, he won't reach the heights of moss or Megatron. Those guys are hall of famer a for a reason. But could he be %80 of Megatron? Could he be a consistent downfield threat that forces defenses to stay honest to open up the field for the run and short passing plays? And maybe work on his  route running as he continues to develop to the point where it at least isn't a liability for him? Yeah, I absolutely think he can be. Let's take instant hall of famer out of the question and just ask of he can be a consistent producer at a position that is notoriously hard to scout, and with very few truely elite producers.",nfl
"There's a natural tendency towards recency bias so if Brady drops off this year and Rodgers *both* wins the Super Bowl *and* has a Brady '07/Rodgers '11/Mahomes '18/Manning '04 type year, I could see the contest for 1st team becoming pretty heated with Rodgers, not necessarily rightly, perhaps having the edge.",nfl

"I dropped out half way through because I had two separate trips, out of state for 5 days and out of country for two weeks, right in the middle of the ranking submission process, which is an ongoing thing that rankers must keep up with in order to prevent a ton of droputs at the end or people scrambling halfheartedly to cram the entire process into a day or two. The person running it even gave me extra leeway with the deadlines because of my situation and history, but I just couldn't really have gotten all the research done.  
  
Both Brady and Gurley were the subject of ""case against"" posts, along with a handful of other players along the way. Gurley's was done by a prominent Rams fan ranker who is one of the better film guys on this sub and was essentially formatted as a reminder not to get too enamored with Gurley's production because of how extremely favorable his situation was and how he struggled toward the end of the season.  
  
The case against Brady was primarily a highlighting of certain statistics and where he ranked among other QBs in these statistics, supported by a selection of film highlighting some of the poor decision making we saw this year from him. Because of the timing of my removal, I actually had a response to this ""case against"" typed out and when I went to post it I found I no longer had sub privileges.  
  
The bulk of my retort was kept intact but I re-formatted a lot of it and posted it [here in the honorable mentions thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/bmkv9c/2019_rnfl_top_100_players_of_the_2018_season/emxtnht/)

"Absolutely clutch. And both know when to run, and usually get down. Dak is obviously more reckless, but his red zone rushes are invaluable.

The 4-3 takes out a LB that leaves them with 2 interior linemen, 2 edge linemen, 2 LBs and 5 DBs, the 3-4 takes out the NT and it leaves them with 2 interior linemen, 2 edge players, 2 LBs and 5 DBs",nfl

I also love the one Parcells tells about how he motivated LT by giving him a plane ticket to New Orleans, and saying he wanted him to trade places with a linebacker on the Saints who did a much better job against one of the O-lineman LT would be facing that week. It pissed LT off and he had a monster game.",nfl
"Kaepernick's cash in his final year was 14.3M.

We would then estimate Kaep to take home about 6.8M. 1/6.8 ~14.7%.

As for not being much charity money compared to NFL players most of those donations are raised by their foundations (not entirely their own money) and Kaep, when he made these donations, was not on an NFL salary anymore. It is far easier to donate when you still have a job.",nfl

"Eh...Brady I'll give you, but Goff's stats were more than just solid. If not for a stretch that occurred right after his safety blanket WR got injured and Gurley started having his knee issues, Goff would have had a MORE impressive stat sheet than almost 65% completion percentage, over 4,800 yards, and 32-12 touchdowns to interceptions.

I feel like Goff got punished for the Super Bowl and the Bears game, which is fair, but also led to people forgetting about the Vikings game and Chiefs game which were probably top 10 QB performances on the year, with the Vikings being the best game any QB had this year.",nfl

Raves are the best time and security doesn't fuck with people unless they are really being a real fucking problem. It's EDC. Everyone is fucked off out of their gourd and if you are the guy that gets singled out by security that's a pretty big deal. Sounds to me like Zeke needs to learn the meaning  of PLUR at festivals and how to dose correctly when he goes to them and not fuck with an innocent security guard.. I'm all for players doing what they want in the offseason. Zeke not apologizing shows that he has no respect for this shit or peace love and understanding. I've been on his side before this. Hes being a dick about it though. Maybe MDMA isn't for him if he cant handle it. Sounds like hes actually a problem.",nfl
"I think the difference last year is that the expectation was super low. They’ve been crowned the prince of the media this year- so if they start losing, people start talking, and it gets inside players’ heads. Would happen with any team.

"&gt;you can't say you don't think Brady's career would have lasted as long

Comparing eras is mostly pointless as the guy stated above, but I'll bite anyway.

Sure it's possible Brady would have lasted as long, but it's highly unlikely. QBs got hit way more and harder in Montana's day. Now you can't touch the QBs head, you can't hit him low, you can't hit him more than a split second after he throws, you might get flagged if you hit him too hard or wrong on a sack... And on and on.

If Montana would have had some of that protection, plus modern medicine, workouts, etc, he probably would have lasted longer, had better stats, won more playoff games, won more SB's. Conversely, absent that, it's unlikely Brady plays as long.  He's not superhuman. You get hit more, your career is going to be shorter.",nfl

"1. Julio - HOF WR still in his prime. Unselfish. Can do everything well.

2. OBJ - Extremely athletically gifted. No reason why he shouldn't have a HOF career.

3. Hopkins - Maybe the best hands in the game. Has improved his YAC and routes in recent years.

4. AB - Older now. Has never had a ton of speed or size to get open, but still an elite route-runner. I didn't factor in his divisive, selfish attitude into this but if I did, he would plummet down this list.

5. Mike Evans - All he does is produce a ton of yards every year. Doesn't get a bunch of easy 3 yard drag routes to pad the stats. He does his work down-field. Imagine if he had a better QB throwing to him.

6. AJG - Similar strengths as Evans.

7. Thielen - Can do everything well.

8. Michael Thomas - Numbers are a bit inflated as are everyone's who plays with Brees. Great hands. Good YAC. Great fit for Saints offense.

9. Keenan Allen - Perhaps the best route-runner. Very agile for a guy with his size.

10. Diggs - Can do everything. Going back to college, I feel he's never really had a QB that knew how to unlock his full potential. Injury issues limit his value a bit. Still a great player.

11. TY Hilton - Never been the best in traffic. He's pretty much exclusive to perimeter but he can make big plays down-field. Good hands. Reminds me of another Colt: Marvin Harrison.

12. Davante Adams - Numbers are a little inflated because he gets a lot of volume because he's the only target worth a damn in his offense. But he still produces. He's really developed into a great player since his early years.

13. Juju - Let's see how he does without AB there to lighten his coverage. Very physical player. Can play any receiver position. I think he's ready to become a #1 WR.

I went to 13 because I believe 9-13 are all in the same tier.",nfl
"Right now I'm nearly done with NFL's Newest Follies (1995), hosted by Comedy Central's very own Dom Irrera. Unfortunately, I messed the sound up when ripping it so there's a really irritating static noise in the background. I have to re-record it. 

I've also finished ripping Super Sunday, A History of the Super Bowl (1990). This one I'm REALLY excited for. It's a little more than an hour of footage from every Super Bowl from I-XXIV. It was one of the ones with the plastic still on it. Being the very first to play a 29-year-old tape is a weird experience.

Also Coughlin ended on a streak of 7-9, 6-10, 6-10 and never lost the team. Everyone was behind him even though they were losing and playing bad. I can't say that would have happened in 2006 or 2009 or 2010 or whatever but after two Super Bowls everyone always respected him.",nfl

- 4th in completion %

- 9th in A/YA

Some of the stats are slightly skewed as a few people played in 1 less game during that time span due to bye weeks, and I tried to omit guys that only played in a few games. Some people probably slide up or down a spot or two, but I don't think it would drastically change things.

I'm not saying he was a top guy across the board, but for the amount of shit he gets on this sub, he far outperformed that.

"&gt;Brees had an excellent season but sputtered out

he was still the 2nd best qb this year. also, a huge part of that ""sputtering out"" was a result of poor performances from his offensive supporting cast.

&gt;Goff's inability to read defenses marred an otherwise solid year. 

he's not top 5 either

&gt;Going by the numbers Big Ben was the second best QB in 2018

no he wasn't lol. maybe if you just look at volume stats.

&gt;Wentz has ended two consecutive years on IR

definitely wasn't top 5 either

it is

the qbs i ranked above brady: mahomes, brees, russ, luck, ryan, rivers",nfl

"[Freeman got 13% of his targets when lined up outside the backfield in 2017, while McCaffrey got 35%](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2018/2017-slot-vs-wide-rbs-and-tes) (on more than twice the number of total targets). I think that's the biggest difference.

I think the bigger question is whether Kamara should qualify--I kind of think he should, but ~~my uneducated sense was that he was used more conventionally in 2018~~ than the prior year, when he was targeted 34 times from the slot or out wide.

(FWIW, Cohen was the only back in 2017 with 25 min. targets to receive a majority of his targets from outside the backfield. As a note, I only use 2017 because the Football Outsiders 2018 numbers aren't up yet.)

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Turns out [Karama took 32 percent of his snaps last year from outside the backfield](https://www.rotowire.com/football/player.php?id=11732), which is still a LOT. I think he has a strong argument for being the #1 scatback in the league, just based on how versatile he is. Interestingly, CMC was used much more conventionally last year in terms of where he lined up, after getting a huge number of targets from the slot or out wide during his rookie season.",nfl
"&gt; His pocket awareness causes him to take worse hits because he doesn't throw it away or crumple pre-hit like Brady does.

Aaaand you just put your whole point under a cloud with this bit of foolishness. Say he really liked the big play when he was younger and held the ball too long -- that's all too true. But to say he doesn't know the hit is coming is just plain nonsense. I've watched every snap Cam has taken as a pro and broken down plenty of All-22 tape. He has very good pocket awareness. He almost always senses pressure and moves away from it by either rolling out or taking off up the middle... and the past two seasons he's been dumping off to the RB far more often.

So if we can say ""well Allen had low completion percent in college too,"" Darnold was  turnover prone in college too. Allen won more games than Darnold, and unlike Darnold - Allen was NOT the 1st string QB in the offseason getting reps with the 1's. He was thrown into the fire against top defenses: Ravens, Chargers, Texans, Titans. Darnold also throws many more short yardage gimme completions by design. Hell, I think the Darnold/Allen game Darnold started the game and the entire first half awful.

Poor Mr. Teddy was found dead in his study by Mr. Fiend.

Mr. Fiend recounted his dismal discovery to the police:

“I was walking by Mr. Teddy’s house when I thought I would just pop in for a visit. I noticed his study light was on and I decided to peek in from the outside to see if he was in there. I walked through the snow towards the window, and I had to wipe the condensation off the window to see inside. That is when I saw his body. I kicked in the front door to confirm my suspicions of foul play. I called the police immediately afterward.”

The officer immediately arrested Mr. Fiend for the murder of Mr. Teddy.

"You guys have run that a lot with 2 WRs stacked spread out way wide on either side. It spreads the defense sideline to sideline.

It's a great formation actually, because you automatically create a dilemna for the defense. They have to put two DBs over each stack. Then they can either go single high and leave big shots down the sideline possible, or go into a two high look and lighten the box. 

It's a really good formation for Wilson.",nfl
"Yes because Edelman’s stats are not anywhere near the guys we’re talking about. He’s a replacement level WR1. That’s not shitting on him, he’s a 7th round college qb who turned himself into a good starter, he’s had a great career all things considered

For every Brandin Cooks level guy brady has had, Manning has had multiple at the same time. Hell, Welker went from far and away the first option on the pats to the clear third option on the broncos

You can’t find any stretch where Peyton didn’t have either a straight up hall of fame level guy, multiple guys who were as productive as bradys best option, or some combination of both.

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.


The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",nfl
"&gt; I’m all for reasonable discussion but you sighted not having to pay Amari as a good reason to get rid of him and then turned around and made MBC the highest paid WR ever. We’re going to pay Cooper handsomely too don’t you worry but he produced for us. If you span his per game production in Dallas over a whole season it’s 1300 yards and 12 TDs and he averaged 70% catch percentage on targets compared to 55% average over 3 years in Oakland.

Cooper definitely looked like a better player in Dallas and if he plays that way for an entire year he'll deserve the contract he's about to get.  Even at Cooper's best he's not on the tier as AB... I don't think that's an unpopular opinion but apparently you seem to think he is.  AB's 'declining' year was him catching 15 TDs for 1300 yards last season... so prorate Cooper's year with the Cowboys and that's a 'declining' year to AB... according to you.  Will he be a headache for the Raiders?  We'll certainly find out but in the short term it's pretty clearly an upgrade on the field at the position plus we gained a 1st round pick (minus 3rd/5th round).  Cooper is set to make 14M before his extension... AB's new deal is 17M/year.  We'll see what Coop's guaranteed is next year.

&gt;The last time AB was that high was in 2015 and since then he has gone 68% 62% 61.9%. I’m fine with you being fine with trading him. I hope it works out as a win win, and I agree that he wasn’t worth paying when he was there in Oakland. But to say he isn’t worth paying in Dallas is crazy talk from a team that just gave out the bag to AB who’s had some declining years lately and is borderline insane.

I'd like to see Cooper be more consistent.  It's plagued him his whole career, including with the Cowboys.  Catch rates are one small part of the story.  Again, if you think Cooper is a better player than AB... I guess everyone has an opinion. Cooper is certainly younger so there's that but MBC hasn't really 'declined' like you've mentioned.  Dude's still a top 5 WR on the field.

Cooper was one of my favorite draft picks of all-time.  I'm not dissing the guy.  But he's had issues with consistency his entire career and he's about to cash into a big-time deal.  I'd like to see him not disappear for weeks on end like he has a tendency to do.  I absolutely see the trade as win-win and think both of our teams are better because of the trade.  I'm not here dogging on the guy or saying he's not good, but I'd like to see him more consistent before putting him in the top tier of receivers.",nfl
"no it's not impossible, but it is much less likely.  Otto would be competing against hundreds of thousands more players at the hs and college level.

At that point it's all a hypothetical and ""adjusting"" stats between eras isnt a reliable or exact science.  Just a way to try and force historical players into the GOAT conversation when you don't need to.  They're the greatest of their time.  That doesn't mean they need to be given a handicapp so we can say they're better than the greatest players of the most competitive age.

"All fair thoughts. I just don't feel like he is skilled enough to be a franchise QB and win a superbowl on a vet QB contract. 2016 was great but I think it is an outlier.

I tend to want teams to be super aggressive though with their QBs figure out if they are franchise worthy fast and drop them if they aren't. Feels like the only way to win the SB recently is either.

A. Franchise QB, or
B. Young guy on his Rookie Contract (cheap and can build a really good team elsewhere.)

Note: There are always outliers (Foles, had to win 3 playoff games and Manning (2015), All time great defense)

Anyways you probably watch more of Carr than me though so maybe you are right. I just wouldn't want my team to sign him. Good luck to the Raiders. I actually don't mind what the plan has been with Gruden at the head looking more long term (3-5 years) and trading your players.

"Well, I watch the games and see Rhodes lock down top recivers just as well as anybody in the league(he was arguably best CB in 2016 and 2017). He gets dinged for committing penalties(both called and uncalled) and PFF seems to think that he tends to let his receiver get away from him too often(but the ball is still rarely thrown to them). By far the most glaring issue is that PFF doesn't seem to factor in Rhodes' ability to shadow the best recievers (probably the hardest job in the league, and Rhodes goes man to man as much as anyone) and the opposing receiver's ability, so Rhodes getting beat on maybe 5 plays out of 40 in complete man coverage against a top 5 WR is somehow seen as worse than a #3 CB getting beat 3 out of 30 times against a #3 WR, while requiring safety help occasionally as well.",nfl

"I don't think super teams would realistically form as the hard salary cap still exists. Players are going to continue to be motivated to pursue higher salaries, as they should. To me, the franchise tag should be abolished because of that team control. I think player choice is a good thing. If a player finishes their contract and wishes to play elsewhere that is their decision. Kirk Cousins played it pretty perfectly and got himself a great contract, but imagine if he got injured. Look at Earl Thomas. Locking a player to a one year deal against their choice, in my opinion, isn't cool.

As far as the opt outs, I was thinking them in the sense that a player might sign a 2+1 where the last year they can opt out and enter free agency or opt in for another year of that contract. Those are good. The situation you detailed about a player quitting on a team is awful for the team and fanbase and I don't think a player should be allowed to be bought out of their contract and allowed to join other teams on brand new contracts (except in rare occasions, like if it is after the trade deadline or if they're not receiving play time and another team would give them more opportunities).

I do understand what that feels like. Now imagine the Rams had a bounty program and were trying to injure Brees all game. Better yet, imagine while all that is happening, the refs give thumbs up as the defense gleefully destroys one of the greatest players in your franchise.

"According to Bill Belichik, Bert Jones was one of the best QBs he'd ever gone against.  Jones was just consistently injured.  

I didn't grow up in that era to know how ""close"" the Colts were to serious contender, but if the Baltimore Colts were better in the era, they would have stayed in Baltimore.  They likely don't get the #1 pick in 1983, and Elway goes to a different team, or tries to force a trade with a franchise that may have played hardball.  

Now Unitas was healthy for SB 3, but how healthy was he?  Missing almost the entire year, likely impacted timing and chemistry, even on a veteran team.  If the Colts were whole chemistry and health wise in 68...do they beat the Jets?  What would the ramifications of that have been?  If the Jets don't have SB 3...would the owner have relocated the team at some point in the late 80s early 90s after the Giants took control of the city?

And as a fan of the Eagles in the late 80s early 90s, I'll cite two over a ten month period, although calling one an ""injury"" is a bit insensitive--Cunningham the first game of the 91 season and then Jerome Brown's death the following spring.

"It's not a bad signing in a vacuum but our situation did not call for handing out the biggest defensive contract in NFL history that off-season.

Again that was Ross. 





Tannehill had been extended in 2013 so it was clear the team wanted to make him the franchise. Yet instead of investing in quality offensive line depth, after a year in which our o-line got hurt and tanked the season (2014), we go out and overpay for a position that really wasn't that concerning at the moment.



How well did our defense do with Suh?

2016 - 18th pts, 29th yds (a franchise record btw), 11th TO

2017 - 29th pts, 16th yds, 29th TO 






His impact did not match the contract. He was a good player but our FO was a complete circus at the time. He's still taking a huge chunk of our cap and hasn't played a down for us since 2017.

I'd only compare Harry to 2017 Gronk. I think the big question was, how good was Gronk is 2017? He got 682 yards (around 6th for TE) and 3 TDs. I think Harry has the potential to match those numbers. However, Gronk's ability to run block and to draw double coverage should not be understated, and Harry will be a significant downgrade in those categories.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, if Harry can draw CB1 coverage, that will open things up considerably for the other WRs. I did not have faith in the WRs to consistently move the chains last year.

"Acknowledging CTE would open them up to lawsuits and the NFLPA to require them to provide long term care for damages that happened while playing in the NFL.

"Personally for me (and my bias is showing here), two guys stand out... Welker and Edelman.

Wes Welker because he is the guy that really revolutionized the position.

Julian Edelman because he is statistically the 2nd best postseason WR of all time and played a huge role in 3 Super Bowl wins. No slot WR can say that.

But there are a lot of other guys who are in this conversation.

You have Charlie Joiner who could be considered as one of the first slot guys in that Air Coryell offense.

Wayne Chrebet was one of the more recent guys who truly played in the slot, but doesn’t get much recognition for it. Like 300 of his 500 catches were on 3rd down that converted a first. 

Larry Fitzgerald, Andre Reed, Tim Brown, Hines Ward all guys who spent time in the slot.

Victor Cruz, at his peak, was amazing to watch. Jarvis Laundry too if he keeps up his production.",nfl
"&gt; Except Stafford can run a 2 min offense. He has proven that multiple times.

"I expect our passing defense to improve this year. We're no longer flinging out the corpse of Brent Grimes and got rid of Mike Smith and Jon Hoke(terrible secondary coach). While not extreme improvement, I think we'll have better numbers. 

Honestly, I think the cold hard truth that will doom the Bucs is probably something else. You could've gone with how Winston isn't a franchise QB.....or I got a fun one for you. The Bucs hired the wrong HC. A team in desperate need of a rebuild hired a Win-Now mentality coach. That could set us back another decade.",nfl
"Not only is John Elway the most overrated quarterback in history, but he's also uncoachable, cannot get along with anyone he has had to work under, has a feud with basically everyone, and is an all around entitled douchebag who used his father to strong arm him into subversing the draft process. He also has a lower passer rating than any franchise quarterback in his era including people who aren't in the Hall of Fame. Also, the Broncos window has closed and they're not going to win again for a long time. Also, if Brock took Elway's idiotic offer instead of the Texans' idiotic offer, we would all be joking about him instead of the Texans.
He was also overhyped, was a loser at Stanford, both in the sense of losing games but also as a human being who couldn't handle a loss without complaining for years about the officiating when he could have won any of five losses just to get into a crappy second-tier bowl game that no one would have bothered to watch, and he benefited from an era where stats and footage weren't so readily available so the media had a much better say in who was considered good.
He also spent much of his career in Denver demanding as much attention as he could get and then complaining when he received said attention, saying he just wanted to be left alone. He's also the only quarterback in NFL history to whine so much that he gets to pick the head coach, the offensive staff, his teammates, etc. all so the team can spend two decades chasing Moby Dick and get this guy a ring before his bones shattered. Which they finally did, after violating the salary cap. Also I heard he got a speeding ticket once.
Also, Denver is a city of quitters. It was created by people who hiked out west, saw the Rocky Mountains, and said ""fuck it we're gonna live here"". And every asshole who lives there descended from this tradition of quitting. It's a city so ugly that they moved the airport several miles out of the way so the unfortunate Americans who have to pass through Denver to change planes don't actually have to deal with the city. They couldn't even build a real football stadium so they used a minor league baseball stadium instead. Then they spent millions converting it back to a baseball stadium but didn't use it for that for 20 years because MLB wanted nothing to do with it. Also Larry Walker is overrated. The only good food to ever come out of Denver was Chipotle, which makes millions off scamming people into thinking GMO's are bad and wasting valuable farming space and valuable dollars by riding on this hipster wave. Even your statues try to kill people. And the state of Colorado is the dumbest design possible. After the city of quitters settled down their families, they pulled out a map and said ""what shape should we make this state?"" And the quitters MADE IT A FUCKING RECTANGLE. They're about as creative as the Colorado Rockies' nickname.

"On the one hand, CHJ is already under contract for a steal and will be on the wrong side of 30 after his contract expires. This gives the team a lot of leverage, as he's not going to make up the ~$9 million he'd miss by holding out this season. On the other hand, you're absolutely right. As a UDFA producing at the highest level, and taking a team-friendly second contract, he's been making far less than his play on the field would warrant since he arrived.

Bringing in Callahan from the Bears could replace CHJ in the slot CB role (though his injury history should be concerning, and CHJ is arguably best in the league in the slot so it's still a downgrade) and ""those who know"" (I don't know enough to verify) say that Fangio's defensive scheme puts less pressure on outside CBs, so having a top-5 outside CB (as CHJ is in that role) might be less important for the team. So paying CHJ the $15 million he's asking for per year after this season might not be worth it, even if CHJ is one of the best CBs in the league.

I don't personally agree with that assessment, as it seems like Fangio also likes to have complete flexibility with his defenders so he can show any look pre-snap but do anything he wants post-snap; CHJ fits that bill quite well. Also, I personally want to see CHJ compensated for doing so much for the team at such a deep discount for all these years, just out of principle, and to keep him a happy member of Broncos Country since I think he could easily transition to coaching (and be great at it) post-retirement, which could pay dividends well after he hangs up the cleats. Finally, CHJ has probably become one of the best (football-wise) leaders in the locker room since Peyton and DWare left the building (Von's a great cheerleader for everyone, but CHJ -- and Derrick Wolfe, who's incidentally also on a cheap deal -- are the leaders who call people on their bullshit; need both kinds of leadership).",nfl

"So the standard really depends on the division you’re in. I would say the top 4 teams could probably compete with low division 3 college teams in America.

Sam Darnold has great potential, but he was a rookie and played like it, finishing with a sub-80 passer rating, but the Jets still outscored the Dolphins.

The Ravens had a very good offense despite Flacco's middling performance and Jackson struggling with his passing consistency. Tannehill and Osweiler both completed a higher percentage of passes and had a higher QB rating than either Ravens QB, yet Baltimore still outscored Miami by 70 points.

The 49ers were starting UDFA Nick Mullens for a huge chunk of their season and outscored the Dolphins. The Broncos got a mediocre season out of mediocre Case Keenum but still outscored the Dolphins.

Remember your 2014 Jetes under Marty Mornhinweg? The year Geno Smith played 13 games and couldn't complete more than 60% of his passes? They scored more than the 2018 Dolphins.

Sure, Gase can do well with Peyton Manning. Quite frankly, so could you or I. But that wouldn't mean we're good coaches lacking a QB. 

Gase had more than enough to make it work last year and didn't. Darnold will help. I think he's going to be a Pro Bowler one day, with the potential to be an All Pro if the Jets don't screw him up (spoiler alert: they will). And an offense with Darnold and Bell is going to improve regardless of the coach, so I would expect the Jets to be better this season on offense. Unless Gase's ego gets in the way like it did in Miami.",nfl
"Don't be sorry, maybe chill though.  You're just being a bit pedantic.  Freaking out about ""lighting up defenses"" and missing the larger point that Cooper played much better in Dallas in that Oakland.  His YPG average was higher than even his first two promising seasons, and his 6 TDs in 9 games also matched a 16 game career high.  But you're obviously right.  Once he has his third good game of the season he should be benched, because that's all he's good for.",nfl
"I've looked at software engineering positions at NFL teams before (never applied because they all pay under market rate) but they all have a line like ""Passion for football a plus"" or something.

I don't think they'll quiz him on X's and O's but I can imagine during the non-technical parts of the interview they'll get a sense of if he's a fan or not and it could give him an edge if he's competing for the position. 


Also if he's the quantitative analyst position with Ravens that was posted here a few weeks ago then football knowledge is a huge part of the job and they won't hire someone without it.",nfl
"Josh Rosen was dealt a bad hand. I'm pulling for him in Miami. That said, what are people honestly expecting from Jackson this season? I'm expecting more of what we saw last year. I hope he develops into a capable passer but from what I saw last year, there's no reason for me to believe I'll see that happen this year.",nfl
"&gt;I've seen nothing on this other than her assertion that it happened. Maybe she was jailed; maybe she wasn't. I haven't seen any evidence of it, though.

Why lie about that?

&gt;Yeah, domestic violence victims never recant. She's also maintained since then that she was lying when she recanted and that the abuse happened.

So she's clearly a habitual liar. Look, I'm not saying that it 100% *didn't* happen, but when a woman who has a history of lying is involved in a he-said/she-said situation, it's a little tough for me to just say ""welp, he's a piece of shit, case closed!"" With no evidence and charges being dropped by prosecutors, what do we have? Conflicting statements from a known liar. 

That having been said, if there is evidence that he did abuse her, then fuck him. I'm not speaking from self-interested bias here - there's virtually no chance at this point he ever plays for the Skins - but I *have* had people close to me affected by false allegations, so I take it very seriously. My best friend almost got kicked out of college because he had a one-night-stand with a girl, and she had next-day regrets and accused him of rape, and it went pretty far until her friend eventually was able to convince her to stop with the whole sham. As I said above, if Reuben did beat Elissa, then fuck him, throw the book at him, but drawing conclusions based on what we know so far is really irresponsible. 

&gt;And never mind the physical marks on her from the second incident.

According to Ennis, that happened in a fight with some other girl. Again, she could be lying, but who can't say with any confidence what happened. 

&gt;I say all this as an Alabama fan. The dude is very likely a woman beater and a piece of shit.

And I say this as a non-Alabama-fan: we don't know shit except multiple conflicting statements from a known fraud. If he is a woman beater, then fuck him, but again, drawing conclusions based on what we know at this point is terribly irresponsible.",nfl
"Again. They already played defense for 4 quarters before that though. Don't like it? Don't tie. It's not like they didn't play defense at all.

If the second team is guaranteed a possession, the advantage swings their way even further than the slight advantage for the first team currently. It would be less fair than it is now, and that's much more important than if the team that wins the coin toss doesn't have to play defense.

So guaranteed possessions are out. I could see the desire to play an extra quarter or half quarter, but there are safety concerns there as well. Honestly I would miss the ""sudden death"" nature of our current format though. But it would be better than guaranteeing a possession.",nfl
"Your take on Gronk isn’t one I was expecting at all. What you’re describing isn’t even a HOF career, which I definitely think Gronk is.

However, I’d concede that Harrison and Wayne were much more available for Peyton than Moss and Gronk for Brady, and for longer.

Slight conversational pivot: are we certain that Reggie Wayne is a HOFer? Does he rate higher than guys like Bruce, Holt, Andre Johnson, Calvin Johnson, or Steve Smith? One All-Pro and six Pro-Bowls for Wayne—super comparable to Brandon Marshall (who didn’t have Peyton Manning) who very few people would put in the HOF.",nfl
"No there arent enough games in a season it would be too easy for teams to tank. It happens every yr in the NBA and now that they changed the format to the last 4 teams have the same % to get the #1 pick it just causes more teams to tank because you can tank to the 4th worst record and end up with the highest chance still.   

No.",nfl

He talked about his mechanics issues in an interview this offseason, and cited that so often he has been so far above the talent level of his opposition that he didn’t need to have mechanics, so it kinda just went loose.

"&gt;maaaaybe it was because of the freaking industrial revolution happening in those years but certainly not from deflation

This is what every mainstream economist gets wrong. When deflation occurs from an increase in productivity (increase in goods and services) that is invariably good because you're increasing the standard of living for everyone. The Industrial Resolution resulted in deflation, not the other way around. It forced the other industrialized countries to lower their prices in order to compete with ours. How horrible right?

&gt;You can do a very simple thought exercise concerning deflation and ""currencies"" like Bitcoin

It's not a currency, it's a speculative commodity. It's value now is comparable to thousands of years ago when most people didn't know the value of gold as a medium of exchange and instead used to barter or use seashells. Fiat currencies right now aren't much different than seashells except for the guns that back them.

&gt;If my gold coin or 1 BTC is worth exponentially more in a few years than this morning why would I ever spend, lend or have the need to borrow capital to buy my home, build a business/infrastructure, or whatever else? You wouldn't. No one would. At best they would spend the bare minimum and then hoard the rest for the future gains. When people don't spend, lend or borrow economies die.

Again, it's not even close to being used as a current account of exchange because it's way too speculative and the payment infrastructure isn't even there yet. Under a commodity like bitcoin, money would be incentivized to be lent out for productive endeavors as the deflation due to a productive economy is like a free market interest rate on an immediately withdrawable loan.

[Unlike now where banks create money out of nothing for unproductive lending such as mortgages and leveraged asset purchasing](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/022416/why-banks-dont-need-your-money-make-loans.asp). This creates unnecessary inflation in assets for the asset holders at the expense of the non asset holders.

&gt;but I'm pretty confidant in saying it's better than pegging our or the worlds economy to an arbitrary rock dug from the earth, whose value fluctuates anytime someone digs more out of the ground. Not really a solid fiscal policy IMO.

You're right, which is why Bitcoin is better as there is a fixed, predictable rate to which it is ""mined"". [According to you this receng ""gold rush"" is deemed as normal](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1).

&gt;Also, very humble of you to decide that the last 50+ years and thousands of economics PHDs are wrong, and you're right. 

I don't pretend to know everything, but I trust the most successful investors in the world over the Fed who couldn't see the subprime crisis until after it hit them in the face. 

Right now the value in Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation, and people all around the world will use it to save their purchasing power due to central banks being more inflationary than ever before.",nfl

before he was drafted, he'd been suspended for selling a jersey to someone they considered an agent and at his pro day the QB he chose didn't live in athens, GA and that made him ""ineligible"" or something, so all the scouts and NFL people were barred from the sidelines, he could have just been fed up with all the bullshit because i've never heard anything else about it

he's pretty lowkey though and i know a lot of people who DO love the game that decide in college it isn't for them because it's a full time job that takes a massive toll on their bodies. 

i did some work on walter jones house when he lived in harvest, AL years ago and he's low key as well, maybe someone took their demeanor and spun a story, i don't know.

"""T**he best quarterback in the NFL is** Brady.  


""If he were the best quarterback in the NFL, he wouldn't be on Twitter,"" ESPN NFL analyst Daniel Jeremiah told Bleacher Report.  


The Brady Show's Twitter account was suspended last year as part of the Patriots contract with the Patriots. The suspension wasn't just a punishment for Brady for his social media posts. It was also punishment from the network for letting his tweets fly. Brady has responded by writing about his suspension.  


Brady has been outspoken about his time with the Patriots. On Sunday, he explained that he was suspended for ""personal reasons."" When I asked him about that, he paused, shrugged his shoulders, and then continued speaking. The suspension was for ""personal reasons,"" he said.

The Patriots draft yielded a league-low in total snaps played, they traded a 5th round pick for a Josh Gordon rental, a 3rd round pick for Danny Shelton who only started one game, and shipped off Brandin Cooks without a capable replacement on the roster. In fact the Patriots still need receivers to this day.

On the good side they got Jason McCourty for virtually nothing and traded for Trent Brown. But do those two acquisitions make up for the above, and push BB into the category of best GM in the NFL?

You ever heard of a poll in which people turns themselves in for? No, because such a poll is not representative and it allows for manipulation. It's an inherent problem in all evaluation that only the most negative or most positive reviews will make submissions because indifferent people are indifferent, but they're still part of the population!

To your point with the tanking, I agree and disagree. The 76ers fired their GM and coaches when they were tanking as well.

"You know, he’s just as tolerable as Alex Jones. Mike is a longtime sports radio personality out of NY who is loved by old fucks because of his “old school” philosophies. He’s a fool. He retired last year only to come back and his tour of when he retired lasted what felt like 6 months. Since he’s been around forever his voice is almost unavoidable, so his shitty takes/opinions get regurgitated all over.",nfl
"Or, just maybe, he takes less salary because he still has tens of millions of dollars in the bank from football on top of other tens of millions from endorsements and he realizes that there's only so much you can do with many multiple tens of millions of dollars? I know it sounds like a stretch to some, but I think it holds some merit.",nfl
"I wonder what the league average is after 4 or 5 years.  It seems crazy to have none, but with how short the average NFL career is, and how rare it is to see late round picks hang on, I'd bet most teams don't have more than a couple players from any given class 5 years out.",nfl
"I phrased it really poorly looking back. But what I was getting it is essentially I'm not saying bad teams shouldn't hate their teams because they didn't win it all. Always have that pride, no matter how the team does. It's the ""lol we'll only be a playoff team and that's ok"" mentality that I think is not a great mentality to have as a fanbase.",nfl
"&gt;He is good for one 100 yard game just over every 5 games played.

And Rice had 76 in 303 games, or one every four. Moss had 55 in 218, or one every four. Yeah so Thomas sucks.

&gt;1 TD every 3rd game 

He has 23 TDs in 47 games. So not only are you ignorant, but you suck at basic arithmetic.",nfl
"Couple years ago we started a soccer club in the lowest sunday league in our city with our extended friends. Basically we just “trained” twice a week, got hammered together on saturday and played a football game on sunday. 


Imagine like 8 out of 11 players not wanting to go for the ball after a corner kick, because everyone was hungover and it HURTS like hell. Also, regular bathroom brakes during the game because people had to pee from the pregame beers. Good times",nfl
"I don't think there is one hard and fast way to do it.  
  
For our defense, we won the Super Bowl off the backs of our insane pass rush. Sure, we had good secondary play, but our defensive line really elevated the entire unit and we saw that in the Super Bowl when our secondary got shredded. And we still pressured him at a 40% clip despite not really hitting him. I'd be curious on Brady's time to throw splits in that game.  
  
On the other side, the Pats defense in SB52 was similar to what they had in SB53. They had Hightower this year, probably better CB2 play opposite Gilmore (who was outstanding to finish 2017) as well. That defense still got shredded. They pressured Foles at a 30% clip. Foles had a 113.5 rating when he was kept clean vs 88.9 when under pressure. Pats defense pressured Goff at a 42.8% rate and he had a rating of 11.3 in those situations compared to 85.8 when kept clean. Yikes all around but the drop off is to be expected *and* they pressured the QB considerably more than the year before. But they were still good when they didn't pressure him with good CB talent (one factor anyway).  
  
Guess my point is they can each help each other.",nfl
"There are some interesting receivers in years 2 and 3 that have the chance to step up. David Moore had big games while Baldwin was out. The eternally optimistic and positive Pete Carroll said they should have given Jaron Brown more work last year, and intend to this year.

Rookie receivers tend to get off to a slow start due to learning the scheme, but if just run go routes all day long and smoke guys, does that still apply? We'll see how long it takes DK to get going.",nfl
"I mean, ifs not quite as simple as either of us are putting it. But your argument sounds like you think a good OC and offensive minded coach is obsolete, which is absurd. It's way more than their talent getting them open. Good coaching and a well executed offensive scheme drastically improves offensive numbers. Thus, scheming people open.",nfl
"Jack Del Rio was lusting after Suggs, but Shack Harris wanted Leftwich. Vic Ketchman confirmed if the Ravens had traded up the pick would have been Suggs.

In 2004 the entire Jags organization was in love with Roethlisberger, but since they'd taken Leftwich the year before they decided he needed more weapons. I mean, who drafts 1st round QBs in back to back years? :)",nfl
"Both of those things are true tho. Cam isn’t an accurate passer *and* completion percentage isn’t a perfect measure of accuracy. People weren’t saying he was inaccurate because of his bad completion percentage, but it was one thing that helped back it up

Another way to put it: good completion percentage doesn’t necessarily equal high accuracy, but low completion percentage generally does equal low accuracy

Edit: wow. We live in a world where cam newton is now considered an accurate NFL passer. Who tf do y’all consider *inaccurate* then?",nfl
"I didn't downvote you, but I think you don't get how niche football here is. You have a somewhat big soccer league in the US and your national team is making news during the big tournaments and people watch them. That's all not exisiting for American Football. It's like Cricket or rugby for most people and I can't name a single player of either sport.",nfl
"The media certainly talked about it, but there was no chance Bledsoe was starting in the Super Bowl and he really did not carry the team over Pittsburgh. Bledsoe took over mid drive in Pittsburgh territory, threw three nice passes, then spent the entire second half looking like the playoff Drew Bledsoe we had always known. Defense, Troy Browns block return TD and Kordell Stewart’s ineptitude won that game, Bledsoe was just not bad enough to tank it.   
  
Belichick was never going to play Bledsoe if Tom could physically go. The media heads loved talking about it, but it was never going to happen, and any Pats fans who remember playoff Drew Bledsoe didn’t want it to. All of his postseason experience was ugly, his style clashed with everything Belichick wanted to do and the team had rallied around Brady to a 13-3 streak at that point. I loved the guy but it was not that close to happening.",nfl
I think I'm gonna take a sick day. I went through a lot of weird head spaces yesterday and I don't know that doing that twice in a row is smart. I was too busy bitching out my coworkers to my friends via text all day. My head was too scattered to actually get much work done. I freaked out about not being good enough to even have a family. Plus the cold destroyed me physically. Today off to just do chores all day seems like the smart decision.,nfl
"Let's be realistic, 11-5 isn't their ceiling. 13-3 is more their ceiling, although unlikely.

They're in a huge shift of power in terms of their team strengths, I think they're getting defensive again but they still have two rising stars that can hold their own in Bell and Brown's departure, not to mention that every season is just a chance for them to grow.

As long as they don't have to worry about who's at the helm at QB, and as long as their defense isn't hot garbage, they have warranted Superbowl aspirations every year.",nfl
"One of the best parts of having a well paying job is spoiling my family. Didn't come from much, was the first in my family to get my college degree and now my younger cousins are graduating. Sent them a small gift &amp; my aunt freaked out.

"Not sure the thoughts on this, but all 32 teams are equal parts of the league, all teams should get to host. 

Just rotate it and you get it once every 32 years (or NY every 15 since they have two teams).

If it snows in Buffalo, too fucking bad. The Bills have to play in that weather, so going to a boring-ass dome against a potential indoor team isn't fair for them.",nfl
"It was just reported that Darnold and Gase look great together, that practice is moving at a high tempo and that the practices themselves look like they are being held in August, not May. 

You don't know that he complained about players salaries. That was the beat (read: Mehta, pissed he lost his access to the locker room). The beat was out for blood, why should he take it? And as to usurping the role, Johnson said he made the decision alone, without input from Gase. Gase has gone on record saying he doesn't want control of the roster, and whoever is hired will be in charge of that. 

Johnson did hire this Coach, and he relied on his GM. Last time, his brother had Charley Casserly pick Maccaganan and Bowles. After seeing them together Johnson decided he wanted a new GM.  Those are his words, in his statement, and not the words of th beat who are for shit.  You seem like you prefer the narrative over what facts we actually know. Enjoy that if you want, but you're being played.",nfl
"I don't think it is possible to exaggerate LT's importance to his team and I said the rest of his team was great in every reference to them.  LT is in the highest echelon of players and that is why he is listed in OPs post.  It is no disservice or slight to anyone to say that LT was the defacto defining player on that team if you were to choose one even given his great teammates.

I think you are both understandably inferring that when I said ""he was the team,"" that the team would be in shambles without him as it is a common phrase used for a great player that carries a poor team.  However I used it in the same sense that one would use it for Brady which is why I mentioned him as well.  You are both free to disagree however based on rockman's last comment I don't believe he even understood some of my points.",nfl
"That’s not how it works in a distribution though. The odds that they’ll be middle of the pack (ie average) aren’t actually higher that the odds they’ll be above average or below average, or top 5 or bottom 5. The comments below not withstanding, this actually is a form of the gamblers fallacy because it assumes a drop off as a result of likely going from one level to a (likely) lower level. But the lower level actually is not more or less likely (hence the drop off it is purportedly likely to cause isn’t more or less likely)",nfl
"No he didn't, what are you talking about. They won like 10 games that season with a non division winner's schedule, it was just an insanely loaded offensive team and as a result the defense was poor. I'll remind everyone this isn't the '80s you to balance your team, can't have 8 Pro Bowlers on offense. Brady had like a 120 passer rating before Gronk went down, plus their fourth quarter passer ratings are a joke, Brady had the highest 4th quarter passer rating in the entire NFL that season, they've only lost one game with him to a bad call. No sorry, you're a clown if you think even that year Brady had comparable weapons. As a matter of fact give him that offense and he scores 60 touchdowns.

And you can't deny that!",nfl
"Yeah but he's under contract for those four years, he's not part of the org during those two months. And just because 2 months does not seem like a long period of time does not mean it's worth adding risk to the situation. Tell me one organization that would fire a key stakeholder two months before their replacement is secured.",nfl
"The buzz-feed approach like this to complex issues doesn't help, sorry.

If a bill was introduced to fix the education system, healthcare system, child care and foster system, I would support it. But that's not what's being discuss so I cant help there. Bringing up all those other points is just strawman.",nfl
"Bert Jones, QB for the Baltimore Colts in the mid late 70s and early 80s.  He spent the last few years at Baltimore injured, and the Colts became a bottom dweller.  If he was healthy those years, he would be known as a much better QB--he was injured during the transition to the ""live ball"" era in 79 that allowed for the passing game to thrive--and the Colts likely aren't the worst team in 1982.  Bill Belichik thought Bert Jones was one of the best QBs he's seen.  

If the Colts were more successful during that time, 1) they don't move to Indianapolis and 2) they aren't in position to draft Elway in 83 draft.  If someone else has #1 pick, maybe Elway doesn't threaten to play baseball.  Unlikely Denver ends up with Elway, unlikely Indianapolis ends up with a team (at least via the Colts).   We might be talking about the Indianapolis Cardinals, or Indianapolis Jaguars, or Indianapolis Ravens instead.",nfl
"Yeah it's a really tough thing to analyze. In this scenario a QB who's team goes down by something like 24 points at the start of the 4th quarter doesn't really give the guy a fair shot at making a comeback, yet in this scenario it will still drop his rate. There should be some kind of qualifier like losses only counting when a team is trailing by &lt;15 points at the start of the 4th",nfl
"[Here's a breakdown of last year's penalties](https://www.footballdb.com/stats/penalties.html?sort=uc). The Raiders weren't near the top in any of the ""dirty"" categories (roughing the passer, unnecessary roughness, personal fouls, etc). Troubling that the Bengals *are* near the top, and we have their old DC and their first or 2nd dirtiest former player (thank God Pacman retired) Please don't make me go looking for fines.

So if you're saying we will be the dirtiest team in 2019......I can only *hope* you're wrong about that.",nfl
"He's not going to be pressed at the line and with 4.3 speed, DBs will give him plenty of room. Quick slants and curls to start with, and when he absorbs the playbook more, then have him catch bombs from Russ. Work on his 50/50 catches and track the ball better. These things are fixable. He's not the agile guy as we keep hearing, but he could still have a huge impact.",nfl
"This isn't a specific play, but I'd like to make it illegal for announcers to use the term ""double reverse"" since they never use it correctly.

Ok announcers, listen up here:  If a QB takes the snap and hands it off to a receiver going from right to left (or vice versa) that's called an end around.   If during the course of that person's run, they then hand it off to a other player who starts running in the direction the first ball carrier came from, that's a reverse, because the direction of the play has reversed once.  That's NOT a double reverse.  That's just simply a reverse.  In order for it to be a double reverse that second ball carrier would have to hand it off AGAIN to someone going back in the direction that they came from, and that almost never happens in the NFL because it's a sure fire way to lose a ton of yards.  

We clear now?  Thanks, now stop incorrectly calling shit double reverses.",nfl
"&gt;Called it in 2015...  
&gt;  
&gt;I really still don’t know if I can do it.  There’s just something I don’t like.  And I don’t like where he went.  I especially don’t like how obvious Tennessee was in trying to get an RGIII haul for that pick.  If they really believed in Morcus, why would they put all that trade stuff in the media? (and it was obviously them doing it)  You have to listen, I guess.  But it didn’t seem like they were just listening.  It seemed like they were saying – “YO EAGLES, BROWNS, JETS, BEARS – look at everyone who’s interested!  And we’ll just take him if we don’t like your offer – call our bluff, watch!  So offer us more!”  Then they did call the bluff and, “damn, I guess we gotta coach this kid up – call the billboard company and get a picture of a duck.”  At that spot, its either 1000% sold on that franchise QB and you aren’t even thinking about anything else OR you want to trade the pick, and there’s some trepidation about taking the player.  Hmmm.  I think the Titans have that same trepidation I do.  Hmmm.   They convinced themselves it was worth the risk – like I want to predicting good things.  Hmmm.  It’s almost as if it’s up to Morcus himself to either prove his worth from here on out and his career could go either way.  Hmmm.I just can’t do it.  And part of it is last year – the truth is that I saw what I WANTED to see with Bortles and Manziel.  My notes had more negatives than positives for those two guys and I still didn’t pick busts.  I want to KNOW I have a franchise QB when I watch his tape.  I didn’t get that from Morcus.  I’ll say productive player – not a mega bust – but not a top-8 QB at any point.  Similar career arch to Alex Smith, but with much better stats throughout. ",nfl
"Not great. We picked up a few starters in Thuney and Sony. Wise played okay last year, and Elandon Roberts, Ted Karras, and Grugier-Hill have all been active for 40+ games. Jacoby was a great pick, but we traded him. Wynn and Bentley should be starters this year, but both were on IR before week 4 of last season. We’ll see what we have in Duke Dawson, but UDFA JC Jackson looked great last year, and we drafted Joejuan Williams this pst year, so I am not sure where The Duke falls on the depth chart. 

For the most part they have either been hurt or bad. Mitchell had to retire which sucked because he looked like a promising player and he is just an all around great human being. Cyrus Jones was a massive disappointment.",nfl
"I can't believe he kept making a roster. You mentioned that you don't know what his turning point was, and I'd immediately jump to just not putting the effort in off the field...but he was out of football and still in good enough shape after 2 years to get picked up by the chiefs. He still had teams trade for him, it's unreal.

Great read",nfl
"I misunderstood who you were referring to when you said hyperbole. I thought you were talking about the individuals who were talking about Moore being great. Not yourself. That’s my bad. 

But you’re getting wayyyy to fucking defensive. And almost kind of being a dick about it. I never once said you were stupid. I said the people who think Moore is already great are stupid and biased. I don’t get how to felt like I was attacking you. I understand you’re skeptical and excited. But I guess you’re getting offended at me calling out some biased fans (because it’s not like those kind of people are on this sub...). 

Again, I’m all for Moore because there wasn’t many options. I’m just more skeptical then excited at this point. Agree to disagree, even though I don’t even know what we’re disagreeing on anymore. Lol",nfl

"That’s how the vet minimum can work. If you have over 4 years in the league and take a 1 year deal with no bonus money or less than 90k in total additional compensation, you can sign a deal that pays you the full amount but hits the teams’ cap for what the minimum would be for a 2nd year player - apparently that number is now 645k.

" The biggest thing is going to be the leadership of Suggs/Weddle and Mosley. Like the losses hurt, we aren't trying to hand wave them away, but it's sickening to hear from media experts that only go on name recognition and not what they did. Suggs didn't produce a sack in the later half of the season. 

But the Ravens have consistently been about next man up. They've consistently gotten people replaced in the machine and have made it work. Maybe there will be a fall off, but it's not like they are going to drop out of the top 5 or 10 in defense like some idiots on talk radio want to believe.",nfl
"To be fair, the guy is seemingly beginning to become ""washed up"", though I don't defend anyone who uses that term with a guy still in the Top 5 of almost every accuracy/precision passing stat year in and year out. But, since mid-2015 he's been in a slump. 

Who knows if it's a trend, or simply a slump.",nfl
"I feel like if the Texans lose their QB, they will go 0-16.

Miami's roster is shit, but Fiddy usually can win one by himself.

Cardinals have been rebuilt to the point they might have 8 new starters. 

Can the Pats go 16-0? Yes. I have them even with teams like Chiefs and Saints, but the regular season they could get that Defense rolling and stomp the schedule.

Chiefs go 16-0? This is actually the **most likely** in my opinion. I know they lost a lot of talent, but most of the league does not have an answer to Mahomes.",nfl
"I think people are sleeping on Hardman. He has the speed to attack deep from the slot and with him Kelce and Watkins on the field the offense should be good, with or without Hill. And Hyde, Williams, and the RB they drafted look like a good committee, and Reid is a great offensive coach

&amp;#x200B;

I doubt its the same wild output, but 36 to 42 TD still sounds reasonable. Nobody got to see Brady in 08 after his 50 TD season, Rodgers went from 46 TD in 2011 to like 42 in 2012, and Manning went from 55 in 2013 to 39 in 2014. I would imagine Mahomes will still be very very good, and honestly, the Chiefs should just keep Hill. Some other team will nab him anyway so might as well swallow the bad PR",nfl
"Rodgers is proof positive that no matter how hard your QB tries to carry their team, it ultimately fails. Rodgers still needs his line to block, receivers to catch passes, RBs to be a nominal threat, defence and ST to not shit the bed, etc, etc.

Football is probably the ultimate team sport. Solo heroes cannot carry an entire team. Even if one player is a standout, they still need others to perform.

See: GB's 45-51 loss to Arizona.",nfl
"I'm glad someone who likes PIT sees all the same things I'm seeing. Realistically the Browns and the Ravens both have the ability to implode, and *one* of those teams could go on a cold streak. If they happen to play PIT during that run, PIT could sneak into a division title playing like an 8-8 team and getting two lucky wins where they shouldn't have. 

Last year they had *twelve* single-score games, so a little luck on either side of the scale could break their season wide open in either direction.",nfl
this is a fair assessment. obviously I'm biased so I have him in my top 5 but I totally understand other folks not having him in theirs. Payton and Brees both said in an interview last year that they thought Tyreek was the most dangerous offensive player in the league fwiw.,nfl

"No we don't.  He's amazing.  Anyone who says he isn't is an idiot.

He's got the rings, he's got the accolades.  He is the greatest QB of the modern era.

This list is just showing how dominant Starr was as a QB in his era. An era of less playoff games and primarily run based offence.

He won 5 championships. He is one of only two QB's to lead a team to a 3-Peat in the NFL. Lombardi and Starr in the 60's = Belecheck &amp; Brady of Today.",nfl
The quicker the Jets get Gase away from Darnold the better the chance they have of not ruining his career as a QB. Tannehill was never a world beater but he was just a shell of himself by the time Gase was done. He will absolutely destroy every bit of self confidence Darnold has by the time he is done.,nfl
"So there’s a set salary they pay them, and they can choose to increase or decrease if they need to (not sure why the players would take a decrease). Is that what you’re trying to say?

"Josh Rosen slowly rises to his feet, drenched by the warm Miami rain. None of his teammates lend him a hand, having been scattered all over the field.  Another busted play, another disappointment.

He's tired, bone-tired.  His arms are covered in cuts and scratches, knuckles cracked and bleeding, and he can feel bruises blooming on his ribcage.   He spits blood onto the field, then squeezes the football between his hands.

"Well yeah, no one said he was.

He had a down season by his standards, but in 2015 he had a borderline All-Pro season, in 2016 he was 2nd Team All Pro, in 2017 he was 1st Team All Pro and MVP. That's a difficult standard to meet when you're 41.

Still had a decent season, even if he had a couple of dumb turnovers.",nfl
"Yeah but a QB is probably most affected by overall team performance IMO.  For other positions it's a lot easier to see if you're doing your job because your role is more well defined.  For a DE, you can watch to see how fast he gets to the QB when he is rushing. 

And of course it is possible to judge a QB outside their stats too.  r/Theungry made a very good answer to your question.  But few casual fans will listen to what you have to say if you're talking up a QB with mediocre TD/INT or passing yard totals.  Or a DE with low sack totals.",nfl
"The problem is, it would dilute the teams, talent pool and competition. Would they create another set of 32 teams to have as the 2nd division? Would they just relegate 16 current teams and so have a smaller sample battle it out for the Super Bowl?

European sports can do this because there are more teams and more players. Not necessarily good players but more than enough to meet the demand. This just wouldn’t work for NFL.",nfl
"Your original comment:

&gt;&gt;Most Saints fans have moved on and don't post about it in stark contrast to Vikings fans who still are whining, bridging our sub and posting about us every chance they can get for the last 10 years.

So no, you didn't mention the Rams, but you mentioned brigading (I intimated that the Rams would be the only ones you could brigade, which think is a reasonable assertion). More importantly, you made a direct comparison to our situations that were not comparable. I simply was explaining why they're not comparable and why each situation delivers different results. I never justified the brigading or posting about it all the time. I simply pointed out that the difference in these situations is what leads to the different results.

You are the one responsible for moving the goalposts. My whole argument is a meta argument about the logic of comparing the two situations. You have twisted that such that even my discussing how they are different is somehow me whining and complaining or justifying the reactions.

It's like a history class where we look into the causes of the Bolshevik revolution compared to, say, the rise of Communism in Vietnam. The situations were so drastically different, but just explaining the difference in the two doesn't justify the violence of the Bolsheviks or the genocide caused by the Soviet Union as a result. Do you understand what I'm getting at?",nfl
"My only edits would be to have the Paris Saints, since both are related to the Fleur de lis, since it was both a French holy symbol and on the banner for French royals. I saw your edit saying Vienna can have the Colts, but I feel like Poland would be better served since it was their horsemen were the creme of the crop in medival Europe. The bears can move to Prague since Vienna would already be situated between so many other teams. Aside from those minor things, I fucking loved this list dude. Good offseason stuff.",nfl
"Unless I’m mistaken, when the rookie wage scale was first introduced everything was at nice even numbers.  As every year goes by, it increases by a fixed percentage.  So every year a weird number gets added onto another weird number, and that’s how we get these weird numbered contracts.",nfl
"Peyton probably wasn't trying to juice his stats. He had the green light to audible as much as he wanted. If he didn't think the OL was good in short yardage situations, then calling more pass plays was the responsible thing to do. Perhaps there were injuries that year or maybe they were integrating new players on the line. It could also be scheme/personnel related. 

As for the statistics, the difference between 4.3 and 3.7 Y/A can be explained by more short yardage attempts. For example, week 1 in 2004 Jerome Bettis had 5 att for 4 yards and 4 TDs. That's 0.8 Y/A but the goalline run game was successful.

Occasionally teams and players do chase stats when they are close to breaking records.",nfl
"Because that class only had 2 QB worth a first round pick and were both drafted before the Cowboys' pick.    
They still had Tony Romo.    
It made sense to give him a weapon like Zeke.

Giants thought they could do the same except Eli was much worse than Romo by then.   
Giants had the #2 overall pick and with a need for a new franchise QB.    
There were at least 4 QB worthy of being selected in the first round.    
Instead they chose a generational talent in Saquon, nothing wrong with that, other than the fact they will likely waste his talents not winning any games.",nfl
"Sure a team can incrementally go from great to bad over the course of a few seasons, but you're talking about the #2 scoring defense falling out of the top 10 in one offseason.

"&gt;I'm not saying he's unique necessarily. I'm saying TEs like the ones listed are hard to come by, and that has a big part in why ""Very few TEs break 1000 yards.""  

I mean I just listed 11 including Engram with that WR skillset, and Gronk just retired.  1000 yards is hard to happen because you need skill **and tons of targets**  

&gt;6.33 x 16 = 101. Which isn't far from 115, so sure it could happen.  

But do you expect it?  The guy posted not that it could, but it should/will.  I put the odds pretty low based on the history of Eli &amp; Shurmur   

&gt;Poor wording. ""Open up the passing game"" as in allow wrs to run longer routes and allow Eli to hold onto the ball longer.  I don't see how that is homerism?   

Because you're not accounting for how teams are going to use the extra defender that OBJ commanded.  Engram/Barkley now have an extra man accounting for them, or there's gonna be an additional blitzer since Tate/Shepard can easily be covered by CBs one-on-one.  

&gt;Weeks 1-8 his yards per target was 5.58. Weeks 8-16, it was 11.37. As you can see, 9 yards per target is probably the low end of what he's capable of.  

There's what someone's capable of, and what can be expected.  9.0 yards per target is more than Kelce or Ertz, and Kittle's 10.1 broke TE records.  Homerism is assuming Engram (almost) breaks records, especially when he will be keyed on since all your other receiving threats are weak  

&gt;WIth what? 9.6AYAC per recption, right?  Engram is the next best up with 8.6.Ertz has 3.04, and Kelce has 5.52.  And remember Kittle beat his 1000 mark by nearly 400 yards.  

Kittle broke TE efficiency &amp; YAC records, and got an insane 136 targets.  You say you like stats, but act like YAC one of the most unreliable variables out there e.g. Kittle's &amp; Engram's should regress  

&gt;I only brought up 'rotation' because you said he ""couldn't crack starting lineup."" I don't think I ever insinuated that him being a rotation player is a excuse for 4 sacks.  

Carter was behind Kareem Martin &amp; Oliver Vernon, we have the snap counts to prove it.  Just because he gets rotated in a good bit change **he was the backup** in a weak OLB group   

&gt;Interior help for edge is good, no?  

If it can rush the passer sure.  But Lawrence a run-stuffer, his size &amp; lack of speed/burst doesn't help rush the passer and at 342 pounds he's gonna be taken out on half the pass-rushing downs.  

&gt;I didn't though? At least in regards to Engram. If Engram stays healthy(which OP stated), according to stats, he'd put up 1000 yards.  

According to extrapolated stats with a small sample size &amp; assumption Eli doesn't regress &amp; defenses don't just pull the ""Gronk without Edelman"" strategy on Engram.  There's no longer a  reason for defenses to put less than 7 in the box &amp; have FS bracket Engram  

&gt;This discussion isn't about Eli, though?   

Because if Eli does as bad as he has historically done without OBJ, Daniel Jones comes in midseason.  All these stats go out the window when Giants are 2-6 and DJones comes in week 9, and DJones [is unarguably bad at football](https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2019/4/15/18304541/nfl-quarterbacks-draft-2019-projection-stats-kyler-murray-dwayne-haskins).",nfl

"Your counter is entirely a tangent, the sample sizes here are both large enough I don't know why you bothered to bring that up. I'm specifically talking about football (sorry if I didn't make that clear) and a trend that I'd wager holds true with most players for a huge amount of both tactical and physical reasons in regard to the sport.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Michael Thomas had the 9th most targets to a WR in football, had the 4th highest catch %.

&amp;#x200B;

For a lot of reasons, this as a counter argument doesn't really work. The counter would probably be Antonio Brown's weird yearly Y/Tgt numbers versus Julio Jone's decrease in Y/Tgt with increasing targets, or Micheal Thomas's most efficient year in the year he was most targeted, at a cost of almost a yard per reception. Comparing players outside different systems is meaningless for this, too many variables.

&amp;#x200B;

People who say ""stats 101"" are the same people who say this shit?

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Efficiency decreases with inefficiency

&amp;#x200B;

No, efficiency always decreases with volume because of the entropic nature of the universe and that an increase in repetitions or dimensions incurs more randomness or waste, and when you're looking for a specific result, the chance of success becomes exponentially smaller and smaller. Within similar parameters, efficiency in football decreases with volume of repetitions.

But 1/3 of these fits that ballhawk description. And I'm not trying to say Derwin isnt great at those FS-like qualities. He is, they both are. Derwin posted 13 PDs last season to Jamal's 12. Again, similar. They both also posted 6 PBUs.

And Adams' interception itself isnt great, its very lucky. [Here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h354J9x0DzE). This is kinda why we shouldnt place too much emphasis on ints without context.

Looking at their films, Adams' awareness, especially deep, becomes extremely apparent. [Here's a clip i found w a quick youtube search (the guy talking is pretty loud so i muted it lol)](https://youtu.be/hSGW1HhPPs4?t=120)

Technically they get extended or voided until a restructure is approved.  Worst case scenario if the teams decided not to restructure their deals (which is literally almost 0% chance) they'd have the legal fallback to get paid for the additional games on a per game basis.

"At playing NFL quarterback.

You'll see in due time. They're both so early in their careers that it's impossible to really tell at this point, but I got a hunch and I'm sticking to it. Watson was on his way to throwing more INTs his rookie season btw. Then he got hurt. Rookie QBs usually struggle with INTs. It's the thing they most consistently improve on going into their second season, and pretty much every one of Baker's ""interceptable"" passes were intercepted last season, which is unusual. They'll drop for that reason alone. Not to mention the dude rarely threw interceptions in college, or high school.

I think we've both got our quarterback, and I'm mostly busting your balls because you seem sensitive about it. Which is weird to me because the consensus seems to be that Watson is good with the potential to be great.

Edit: Maybe you're less sensitive about it than I thought. You're not actually the guy I thought you were. Regardless, everything else is still my opinion.",nfl

Throwing two drive killing INT’s against Seattle which set up Seahawks scores led to his team getting blown out in another MVP season.

However, I the point of contention is of whether or not the ball breaks the plane while he's in midair. And since his arm is covering the ball, there's just no way to get a definitive look at what happened. Would you agree with that?

Otherwise, I can completely understand if you told me that it looks like the ball doesn't break the plane. But there's a difference between it seeming that way and actually having 100% definitive evidence (which is what the rule states is needed for an overturn).",nfl

"&gt;Trent produced more yards than Wilkins in each of his individual seasons with us. Get over it.


Dude why are you even arguing this.... like why do you care? What consumes you to try and make the point that *Trent Richardson* ""produced more"" despite also wasting a lot of his carries?


&gt;but he simply did not produce more yards.

Yards =/= production. Brady has more yards than Wilkins, but in terms of rushing, Wilkins has produced more. Because Wilkins did better on each rush. Not surprising, given that Brady is an old-school pocket *quarterback* and Wilkins is a *runningback* with a solid O-line but my point remains. Wilkins *produced* more. Production is not just *yards*, it's also play-economy. If you make &lt;1000 yards in &gt;300 plays, you're wasting plays. Wilkins isn't wasting plays like Trich did.


I have no idea what people did to you in your life to put you in the position where you're vehemently arguing that Trent Richardson has had a better career than Jordan Wilkins, *like it matters*.

"Because the other QB put up a 25QBR and the owner understands that busts happen. 

Everyone on this sub is really invested in the idea that Rosen can be a good QB but was just in a bad situation, but it's entirely possible that the people who watched every snap he played just thought he didn't have the juice. 

It's also important to realize Keim didn't pick Rosen over anybody besides Lamar, he was just the last franchise-caliber rated QB prospect on the board, so who knows how much they even liked him from the beginning, they might've felt like they had no choice.

If you proceed from that standpoint, and your GM who you've found to be pretty good, and who's been with the team in some capacity for 20 years now, says that was a bad move, but let's not get caught up in trying to recoup sunk cost, and that there's a new guy that he believes can legitimately turn the team around, then it 100% makes sense to give him the chance.",nfl

While that was certainly a shame, the pendulum has swung too far the other way towards total worship of the military in some circles. We idealize the military in a fashion that no other developed, free nation does and I find it pretty disturbing. I also think it is difficult to describe our troops as heroic when they're fight'ing endless, unnecessary wars thousands of miles away from home because our government decided thats where our enemies live. Obviously heroes can arise in certain situations, but if you're suggesting that they are heroic simply because they are ""fighting for our freedom"" then I have to strongly disagree with your premise there.

  
I also think it is a discredit to your grandfather and people like him to suggest that everybody in a combat situation is a ""hero"" in anything but a tragic sense. Your grandfather earned that purple heart because he's a hero, and many others did not because they are not.

"To play devil's advocate:

Josh Allen is a legitimate off-ball LB. He dropped back over 300 pass plays over the past 2 seasons, which is far and away more than anyone else at Edge in his draft class. This is in comparison to just over 500 pass rushing plays.

And when he dropped back he had real coverage responsibilities, not just shallow routes or flats. Here he is [covering Jace Sternberger](https://media.profootballfocus.com/2019/03/Q2-TXAM-336.gif) on a deep corner route. 

Wash is also from a coaching tree that shouldn't have trouble finding guys with unique talents and maximizing those roles. Monte  Kiffin always gave a variety of looks from the 4-3, Pete Carroll is a role-player savant, and Gus Bradley was a key part of the Seahawks' excellent role players' successes as well.

Obviously his value is much greater as a pass rusher, but it's weird  to be adamant that he won't be anything other than a pass rusher when he's got legitimate versatility. Legitimate meaning he's great at multiple things, not just able to do them.

"Amash doesn't have to worry about his party taking back the Senate.  The less you have at stake, the easier it is to take a principled stand.  There are only two reasons to impeach the President:

1. To remove him from office.  We already know this won't happen because there is currently only one GOP vote in the House and zero in the Senate, so any impeachment attempt will be completely partisan.
2. To demonstrate to the American people that the President and his party are unfit to lead.  We already know this is useless because the people who elected the President and his party don't care whether or not their elected officials are fit to lead.

I think that the Democrats who are in charge (not the rank and file who are clamoring for it) are approaching it the appropriate way: investigate, work through the courts to remove obstructions, and amass enough evidence to force the hand of the GOP, if that's even possible.  Even without impeachment, they can use the information they gather from the various investigatory committees on the campaign trail next year.",nfl
"I don’t mind Brady being in that range for QBs really but I think his post season performance should put him higher and I think positional importance needs to be entirely re evaluated.

"I believe the list is at least sponsored by r/nfl if that makes sense. It’s my first year ranking so I don’t completely understand the dynamics but I believe mods and frequent users started this close to a decade ago and it’s carried on. I think one of the fallacies in the interpretation of this list is that people assume it’s only r/nfl’s list. We actually brainstormed and came up with the voting for the top 100 that occurs on Thursdays that is meant to be the representative r/nfl list because all users can participate.

Secondly, I don’t think we came into this list with the intent that it will be completely scientifically validated. Two or three years ago it changed from an overall top 100 list to a sole ranking on the past season’s performance and with that the intent was to make a unique top 100 different than the plethora of lists we will see in the coming months. However, we may have allowed for some inconsistencies in methodologies that were unintended and we are seriously looking at overhauling or at least tweaking it.

But, to be fair, this list has operated exactly the same for the past three years or so and there haven’t been any or many system-wide complaints. I believe we can all agree that the issue is almost solely with Tom Brady’s ranking, and for that there is serious merit for concerns. I do believe, though, there are reasons for leaving him off and the issue with many rankers is the consistency for that. For instance, I left him off. But I only ranked 6 QBs I believe he was 7th. I just wanted to recognize all positions at equal importance and I do take offense to people saying that’s stupid because with the way the rules of the list are currently set up, that’s completely a reasonable thing to do.

I respect and appreciate the positive and productive discourse. It gets extremely disheartening and negatively affects my mental health to be consistently and constantly mocked, ridiculed, and in some places threatened and I don’t mean for a pity party but if I come across as arrogant, rude, or anything else I’m truly sorry but please and least consider the mental beating I have taken over three weeks. Call me thin skinned, say whatever you want about anonymity and “it’s the internet” but at the end of the day I put an unhealthy amount of time and effort into this and for not only my personal list to be ridiculed but also my character, intelligence, and humanity to be insulted (and literally threatened) it gets hard to maintain cordiality.",nfl

You're betting at the beginning of the season (or whenever the earliest you can is) on a team who is in the division of a team that just won 4 straight SBs for a total of 9. I think it'd be decent odds no matter what the Bills did that Mecha-Brady and BB were just going to do it again.,nfl
"Regarding #3

&gt;!Dany in **in the books** is constantly struggling with her desires for justice and her urges to simply burn her enemies. She's not evil by any stretch, but she constantly flirts with - to simplify what would otherwise be an essay - liberty and tyranny. **In the show**, this is best demonstrated by Tyrion and Olenna's debate on Dragonstone; the two put forward two competing positions of mercy (Tyrion) vs slaughter (Olenna), and the debate took the place of the internal monologue from the books.!&lt;

&gt;!In the show, Dany hasn't had this inner struggle demonstrated very frequently. She is constantly postured to be a just liberator who rose to power from the ashes her early life as a child bride. From her perspective, this is certainly true; objectively speaking, I concur with a lot of her point of view and how she is presented. But, again this is only in the books, we see the fallout of her decisions from the eyes of others - Quentyn Martell traveled to Mereen to ask her hand in marriage, and on the way he bore witness to the fires of liberation (freed slaves seeking revenge), the corruption of humanity (Cleon the Butcher), and the truth that freedom isn't simply given but won over time (the Astapori &amp; Yunkish War following Dany's ""liberation"" campaign). Barristan the Bold bears witness to sycophants, schemers, and political ploys in Mereen where Dany currently rules; Barristan is likely being played a fool by people who seek to gain power.!&lt;

&gt;!So all in all, Dany in the show is also being ""set up"" for a tragic fall into ""madness."" Missandei died speaking the very words that bore her freedom: dracarys. Two of her three sons have died. Her nephew/boyfriend is distant after learning he is a secret Targ. Her advisers are seemingly scheming against her. (that technically remains to be seen, but tbh I'm sure they are. The story has lost a lot of complexity in relation to the world because the world's realism is dead.) And her fleet &amp; army keep getting ravaged by ~~mystical Cthulhu worshiping vikings~~ discount plot devices.!&lt;

&gt;!I've always suspected Dany would fall from grace in the books. The overarching theme of the series is about what a person does with the choices they make. You're not a good king for being king, you're not a good king for saving the world, you're a good king for what you do after that. Where Tolkien talks about Aragorn helping to save the world and become king of Gondor, Martin goes ""what happens next? Does he raise taxes? Go to war again? Rule peacefully?"" So in that regard, Dany is a collection of choices that continue to do good things with unexpected consequences, several of which posture her towards becoming the ""mad queen"" who burns her enemies.!&lt;

And yes, this was the short version.

Number 4 is basically yes. &gt;!Which is stupid, because that's not how she operates in the world. Her actions aren't that ""evil because evil."" They're selfish, but very consequential. ... as far as why that's no longer the case, it's because they stopped caring about how character decisions impact the world. As I mentioned, we see what Dany's liberation campaign helped do to Slaver's Bay from another person's eyes. Similarly, Arya witnesses the War of the Five Kings from the eyes of commoners who die at the hands of ""uncaring"" and uncaring nobles. We also see fallout from the Red Wedding through the eyes of Jaime Lannister and the Brotherhood Without Banners, both of whom have interests in the Riverlands. The world of ice and fire is far more alive than the show has led us to believe of late.!&lt;",nfl
"I’m not saying the Packers are the best team in your division, but your trash talk was weak. Comparing any team to the greatest dynasty the league has seen is silly. Brady is notable for a reason.

"Lynn is a great coach doing a lot with nothing in terms of the organization. That said, many of the pieces he's used so effectively on offense were inherited from the previous regime. Many coaches could succeed with Rivers, Allen and Gordon. 

From a coaching perspective, their game plan against the Pats in the divisional round  was unacceptable. You don't run the same defence against Brady as you did against Jackson and expect to win.  While sports are uncertain, practically speaking, an AFC playoff team has a 1 in 3 chance of seeing the Pats in the divisional round. The AFC playoffs run through NE and Brady, having nothing resembling a gameplan to slow Brady downs means you're not going anywhere. Top 10 head coaches don't get a pass for hiring incompetent coordinators.

Later in the thread, you complain that Lynn isn't in the top 10 and pretend as though every coach on that list doesn't have either i)years more experience at a similar level of consistency or ii) more postseason success. Look at your only common playoff opponent, NE. Pederson coached well enough to beat them and McVay held them under 20 points.

Brady was the 2nd QB named on the r/nfl 100 that year.

[Looking at the 2014 passing stats](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2014/passing.htm), and based on the approach taken by the rankers this year, I think it's *very* clear that Brady would, at best, have been ranked 6th had *this* group of rankers been ranking 2014 QBs using the standards they used this year.

Which brings up a point here about the rankings: the rankers this year applied a number of rules and a general framework approach that was *dramatically* at odds with past lists (unclear to me whether there was a discontinuity in some particular year or if there's been a creeping change that is suddenly apparent as having gone too far). Even using their own approach there's room to criticize a lot of their picks--it's kind of weird to see Brady and his significantly superior ANY/A placed behind Rodgers and to see Goff unranked, for instance--but the biggest problem isn't so much that the rankers ""did Brady and/or Goff dirty"" as that they applied a bad set of heuristics and their overall approach was clearly flawed (my suspicion is that those flaws are less of an issue when it comes to positions where it's not possible to take as stat-heavy an analytic approach, but that the flaws might only lead to a few absurdities isn't exactly the best defense of the approach).

As I've noted elsewhere: the work's been put in and popular or not there's no reason that the rankers shouldn't continue to post the rest of their rankings. But there's also no reason that those rankings shouldn't be posted as ordinary posts, subject to ordinary upvoting and downvoting, rather than stickied to the masthead and given special status, given that the sub has rather strongly rejected the rankings and the approach taken.",nfl
"1. I don't think you know what high and mighty means.

2. It's not shit content just because you don't agree with it

3. What if I told you this was a series long before any of the mods who ranked were mods, and that it literally has nothing to do with whether or not it's stickied.",nfl
"Finally got around to seeing Into The Spiderverse last night, well, half of it anyway. It was *so* good. I was completely captivated with the art direction, character/set designs and overall style of the film. If I was shooting a movie, it would have been exactly like that.

It just doesn't make sense for the redemption arc to have even happened then. It also basically confirms him getting with Brienne was total fan service. There was some post on r/asoiaf that summed it up perfectly. Basically his whole arc was him getting away from Cersei to finally become the good man everyone wanted/knew he was to then betray everything good that hes done to then go right back where he started? The pay off is just plain awful. His entire journey happens so he can end up literally where he started? It was pointless. They basically Stannis'd him.,nfl
"Yeah, I was checking out r/packers threads near the end of the season and it felt like the Packers sub was, on average, significantly more negative on Rodgers's 2018 play than r/nfl was. My theory on this is that a lot of neutrals see ""25 TDs, 2 INTs"" and assume that it was a great season and Rodgers wasn't the problem at all, and while I don't recall a sense that Rodgers was *the* big problem on the team coming from anyone in the Packers sub, I saw a lot of critiques similar to yours or suggesting that Rodgers was being *too* risk-averse with the ball and the team's performance was suffering for it.",nfl
Saquon was nearly perfect the only knock on him was he too often bounced to the outside and tried to hit the home run instead of taking the short gain. Vision issues. Zeke didn’t have that.

"&gt;!Regarding Jaime, as much as I was disappointed that he didn't end up killing Cersei, as we all wanted. At the same time, I realized that it was the most realistic end to his arc.

His big flaw was and has always been loving Cersei, and he couldn't get past that.!&lt;

"If we're healthy we're probably more likely a playoff contender again than bottom 5, but really the moral of the story is these lists are pointless.  Patriots dynasty notwithstanding, the NFL has impressive parity.  A team with a good draft (hopefully this applies to us) especially at key positions can make huge strides in one year.   A team can also drop off significantly without any significant changes due to players aging or just regressing back to their norm after outlier years.  

SOS, power rankings, playoff predictions etc are just pointless at this time of the year.  But it's the offseason and people want something to talk about, so topics like these aren't going anywhere.  Best to just ignore it if it bothers you and move on.",nfl
"&gt;Ryan Tannehill and Blake Bortles statlines would’ve made them quality starters 10-15 years ago

10-15 years ago almost no one ran a spread offense or ran shotgun and relied on a runningback mostly within the redzone(mannings stats would be crazy for back then if this wasn't as much of a thing). Every coach has more resources than ever to get the most out of their qbs and qbs don't have to worry about getting injured as much. It is an easier league for qbs than it was before which is why many old qbs are still excelling and guys like rothlesberger and phillip rivers are putting up some of their best numbers when they should not.",nfl

All along, they maintained that a weapon like the gauntlet was too much for any human to bear and they kept it consistent by letting Tony go.!&lt;

&gt;!Steve's end was beautiful. I was almost in tears when they showed his ring and finally getting that dance with Peggy. Winter Soldier is still one of the best movies in the MCU and a big part of that goes to Chris for just rocking it out. He was worthy the whole time and Thor knew it.!&lt;

&gt;!I was really surprised that they killed off Natasha, but it does make sense.

It made sense that he was out of it when they first find him, but he felt more like a silly bit character for almost the entire movie. Seriously let down by that. Also, the way they explained away Captain Marvel not being available makes no sense. I mean, yeah, there are people in other galaxies that needed her help, but they don't know what happened.

So you’re saying he performed well against teams he should have? I’ll take that as he grows he’ll do better against the better teams.

"Honestly, I think that is the difference between Brady and other QBs. He is willing to take that pay cut time and time again to make sure his team never suffers, thus making it easier to replicate success every year. Too many players are  of the ""me first"" mentality, especially ones that aren't as important as the QB position so they hamstring their team just so they can have their pay day.

""Perhaps the best example of a well-managed contract may be last year’s monster deal between the 49ers and Jimmy Garoppolo, a deal with a massive first-year cash number of $42 million. The 49ers could have loaded up on signing bonus and pushed out their cap issues, as most teams have with mega contracts for quarterbacks, but they chose—wisely—to front load the cap hit with a $37 million 2018 cap number. And this year, the 49ers signed Kwon Alexander to (ostensibly) a $54 million contract that will only leave $3 million of dead money if they move on after one season. Further, the Buccaneers just cut Vinny Curry and traded DeSean Jackson with zero dead money remaining, having matched cash and cap on those deals. The Raiders can move on from Tyrell Williams’s four-year contract after a year with zero dead money charges after this year. It can be done.

The credit card mentality of signing bonus proration was a concept that smart teams used skillfully when implemented 25 years ago back when there was a team salary cap of $35 million. Now, smart teams are avoiding it as much as possible, in part to avoid being stuck in a position like the one the Steelers and Giants find themselves in after moving on from mega-contracts.""

He had an above-average season, but winning the Super Bowl shouldn't guarantee a Top 100 placement.

Smith has thrown for more interceptions and done so at a higher percentage. Obviously it goes without saying that Aaron Rodgers throws the ball away more than anyone in the league. Rodgers is arguably the safest QB in the league. He's just much better than Smith.",nfl
Sure. There are a lot more variables than playing in a dome though.  What type of talent were they surrounded with on offense?  What type of defense were they facing?  Passer ratings don't really mean shit is my point.  Bad quarterbacks take sacks instead of throwing it away which in turn helps their passer rating,nfl
"Candidates on the Vikings are Trae Waynes, Kyle Rudolph, and Xavier Rhodes (longest of the shots but has been muttered about). I wouldn’t be in favour of either but if the FO do it then I’d just accept that the people who know a lot more about football than I do thought it was the right decision.

Trading Waynes or Rhodes would quickly prove a Vikings meme true I think, you can never have too many DBs. Holton Hill is suspended for the first 4 games of the year and we would be riding seat of our pants with one of the mentioned, Hughes and Mack as the only players with NFL snaps.

Trading Kyle takes a weapon away from Kirk. Kyle isn’t a top tier TE but he will catch just about everything sent his way (1 drop in each of the last 2 years) and has given QBs throwing his way a rating over 100 across his career. He won’t break many tackles but he is a solid piece as a safety valve or red zone target. Getting rid of him would mean asking a lot of Irv Smith (2nd rounder this year) and the other TEs on our roster.

We need cap space but there are other ways to get it.",nfl
"Dude, the year Brady got suspended, *no one* reputable had them legitimately going to the Super Bowl much less winning it; it was a huge blow despite the ""angry Brady"" memes. They got lucky to get out of that with 3 wins against weak teams and then went on to only average 30 points with an average-difficulty schedule. That was definitely an underdog season. They were also statistical underdogs against the Chiefs in the AFCCG last year; the Chiefs were a much better team both on paper and on the field.

"Eh, I think it would be a clear improvement from current situation.  Both offense and defense know who has first possession in OT if it comes to that and plan the entire game accordingly.  You don't get first possession in OT?  Then you do a two-pt conversion, try on 4th down, etc. not confident in going into OT where you don't get the ball first.  You do get first possession in OT, well your opponent is going to do anything they can to make sure it's not a tie game (like 2pt conversions, try on 4th down, etc.).",nfl

"Yeah and our defense is fucking good with or without him, + we made it even better. 

Honestly, we have a lot of options for replacing Bosa at the big end position. 

Ingram could slide over, freeing Nwosu up to play the speed rusher. 

Tillery could slide over to big end. We would likely have Justin Jones starting at 3T in this scenario. Square would rotate in. 

Honestly, as much as I love Bosa, I don’t think he makes or breaks us. He just improves us. We were still *very* competitive without him last year, and our defense pretty much only improved this off-season.",nfl
"Facts.  I didn't want to see the guy paralyze himself, but gun to my head, if I had to pick a player to get paralyzed, he would have been pretty high on my list.  The shit he did to Gio Bernard, in particular, was unconscionable.  And then he had the nerve to complain that they blew the play dead and he didn't score a touchdown after knocking a player out cold with a crown of the the helmet spear shot to the head.  It's cool that the guy is up and walking again.  It's also cool that he's not playing anymore.",nfl
"Completely agreed, thank you for saying this! It's been obvious from the beginning.

It's pretty simple and straight forward. If Brown wanted to get out of an intolerably toxic situation, he'd have been happy to be traded anywhere. But he brought money into it, kept being an ass on social media, and made it more and more difficult to get himself traded out of this intolerably toxic situation. Anyone who wants to believe Roethlisberger was the root of the issues really isn't applying any sort of common sense to it, I think their thought process starts and ends with ""Person say bad thing about Big Ben and I don't like Big Ben so I'll take this bad thing that's said about Big Ben as gospel.""

Since getting traded, Brown has gone on to attack guys like Juju Smith-Schuster and Ryan Clark. Two people who, unless I'm mistaken, are *not* Ben Roethlisberger.

I'm sure something about Ben ticked off AB. But if someone is pretending Roethlisberger is the true source of toxicity in the locker room, then that someone is revealing that they're not paying attention.",nfl
"This is why I'm secretly holding out hope that the Giants somehow pull it out this year and go all the way, Patriots v Giants in Super Bowl LIV. We need to see this matchup again. Two ways I'd enjoy seeing it end:

1. Brady crushes the Giants defense for 400+ yards while Eli throws an interception at the goal line to end the game.

Or...

2. Eli gets benched at some point in the season and Daniel Jones comes in and blasts the Patriots defense to win Super Bowl MVP his rookie season. This scenario would be even sweeter if #6 was available and he took that number as a big middle finger.",nfl
"As talented as he is, this kind of of shit needs to stop. He's old enough and he's been through enough situations like this to know better and at this point, it doesn't seem like he's all that interested in doing better. It's time for Zeke to either shape up or have the team ship him out.

I'd rather have a mediocre ground game than a talented jackass without any impulse control.",nfl
"The stats you're referring to show that extradivisional teams beat the Patriots just about as often as intradivisional teams do. Which on the surface makes it sound like the AFC East gives the Patriots a run for their money.


However teams construct their rosters to win their division. That's why divisional games are almost always competitive no matter what each team's record is. But despite building a team specifically to beat the division leader, the Bills/Jets/Dolphins can't manage to do it any more frequently than the extradivisional teams that aren't built to beat the Patriots.

I haven't touched on the carousel of coaches, GM's, and quarterbacks either. The Patriots still have to beat good teams in the playoffs, but having a first round bye and homefield advantage handed to you by the division sure helps.",nfl

He had like 2.5 bad games in the beginning of 2017. That was it. Most of the talk that season? What are you talking about? He allowed 3 touchdowns all year and had a 49% completion rate against. His 2017 statline was better than most cornerbacks in the NFL that year and is nearly identical to his AP season.

I'm honestly confused. ""Most of the talk"" in 2017 centered around Butler falling off a cliff and not getting paid and not having a pass rush. The secondary has been the strongest part of our defense for years now. Gilmore had a great regular season and spectacular postseason in 2017.

"Not going to spend time trying to dig up old comments, but I've seen it around here or heard it in person pretty often over the years. 

Mental gymnastics like, ""No he's not taking a discount, it's all about the *percentage* of the cap. He was making 12% of the cap (example) which was 4th most among QBs at the time... etc etc"" 

These people ignore the fact that with his resume Brady could have (and arguably should have for the sake of the union) reset the QB market every 3-4 years of his career. Literally any time another QB became the highest paid in the league he could go to the Pats and force them to re-up. Who knows, if he played even a little bit of hardball maybe Belichick and the Pats decide he's not worth it and ship him off to a team willing to pay and the whole dynasty crumbles years ago. 

The point is he actively chooses not to seek his full value in no small part due to the fact that his wife is already worth double what he could ever hope to make in his career (not counting endorsements). Is this fair? Not even remotely. Is life fair? Not even remotely. I'm not complaining about the fact that he does it, that's his choice and if a player on my team did it I would love him for it. It does annoy me when Pats fans try to act like it doesn't happen and/or doesn't give them a competitive advantage, though.",nfl

"&gt; The yardage isn’t the point, they could figure that out with historical data.  
  
How much historical data do you think we have of teams in 4 down territory where the clock doesn't matter? I know how much data we have like that, I'm hoping you do too.  
    
Yards aren't as important as downs. 5-10 yards would absolutely not be enough. Downs govern the flow of the game more than any starting field position. And what happens if the first team scores a field goal? Do we have two different starting field position adjustments based on how team 1 scored? Now we need another set of data. Where does team 1 start in this proposal, at the opponent's 25? Team 2 gets it at the 35 but gets 4 downs and you think that's even? Say both teams score and we're tied again, do we just continue ad infinitum until players collapse from exhaustion?  
  
I'm all for eliminating regular season OT too, because it's more important to me to minimize chances for player injury than to cater to american audiences who don't know how to process ties, but your idea here comes with its own, unique set of problems that, based on the fact that we have zero data on how teams perform with 4 downs and no clock, would take years, possibly decades of trial and error before we had the sample size to say with any kind of certainty how to treat yardage differentials.

"&gt;  the knocks on him were ridiculous. 

I disagree. 

Durability - 2 broken bones and an ACL tear in college. In the NFL he tore an ACL and couldn't fly due to injury last year at one point.  Was a big concern and is still a big concern. Hopefully Houston can figure out the OL is a big deal and teach Watson to not take as many hits.He is 6'2 and a generous 220. Which are the same height and weight of Trubisky. Trubisky looks a lot thicker. Watson is probably just packing a 45 lb sausage in his pants. I mean you would have too, to stand behind that Houston OL. 

Decision Making - Watson threw a lot of interceptions, despite being on the better team most games. Better recievers and better OL, but throwing the ball to the wrong team is a not a good recipe.  You can see his peak against Bama, but in other games his line would be a 1:1 TD/INT ratio.

Accuracy - At times he would just miss throws (A bit of the Josh Allen syndrome) or get bailed out by his recievers on poorly thrown balls. He had probably the worst pre-season debut of the 3 in the class. He looked like a surefire bust, but he got to work and when he got the chance he put it all together for those few games before the injury.

My point is people that saw the Alabama games, would suggest that Watson was in a class of his own. People that watched the other games had a lot of questions about his game. 


Hopefully Watson can continue to be protected and develop.",nfl
"I’m still left very confused with the Honey Badger and his weird comments after leaving.   Allot of players take inspiration and motivation from former teams not paying them or cutting them.   HB did this with Arizona and it made sense considering he was such a hallmark player and he was cut.   

After the Texans bowed out of the Honey Badger sweepstakes after the league leading contract KC offered, and even though they reportedly were in it till close to the end, he went on a social media blitz and called out the Texans, which is fine.  But he then said his previous teammates were “terrified” of Mahomes and KC and wanted nothing to do with them.  That statement rubbed me the wrong way.  Talk all the shit you want about the organization, coaches, the league, but when you were a captain and a well respected member of a locker room, it seems disingenuous to talk shit about your previous teammates.  Was everything he said about loving the Texans locker room and the players there just talk? 

There are way worse players in the league and it’s a stupid thing to get hung up on, but he was becoming one of favorite players and it felt like a betrayal.   I was super excited he got a big contract and resurrected his career, and I’m still happy for him.  This is him probably just getting hyped for his new team and I’m being sensitive, but when you go out and talk up your boys and then when you move on, calling them essentially cowards seems fucked up.",nfl
"QB: 

* **Tony Romo**: 2nd All Time in Net Yards per Attempt

* **Phillip Rivers(**: 4th All Time in Net Yards per Attempt

HB:

* **Shaun Alexander**: Had 100 TDs and over 9000 yards in 6 seasons, then dipped.

* **Priest Holmes**: 7853 yards. 78 TDs. 55 games. There may never again be a stretch of play that dominant ever again.  
	
* **Tiki Barber**: Averaged over 100 yards per game his entire career, averaged 2000 yards per season over his last 5 seasons, and totaled over 4400 yards in his last 2 seasons.

FB:

* **Lorenzo Neal**:  Blocked for a 1000 yard rusher in 11 straight seasons

WR: 
 
* **Torry Holt**: Records include: 6 straight seasons with 1300 receiving yards, and a record 6 straight with 90 receptions. 8 straight with 80 receptions and 1100 yards. Most yards in a single decade. He also retired top 10 in receiving yards.

* **Reggie Wayne**: He retired 7th all-time in career receptions and 8th all-time in receiving yards

* **Brandon Marshall**: If he had competent QB play over the first 11 years of his career he could have gone to the Hall. Still managed to average over 1100 yards a season for that timespan. The Beast played Safety as a Junior in college and led his team in tackles, and owns the 1st and 3rd highest single game reception totals in NFL history. 
 
* **Wes Welker**: Simply put: Wes Welker changed the game of football.

OT:

* **Joe Staley**: Has had HOF Caliber for the 8 years but was basically a bust for 3-4 years and it will keep him from The Hall

* **Tony Boselli**: Possibly the most dominant lineman in the league until his career ending injury. Longevity kept him from the Hall, and nothing else.

OG:

* **Steve Hutchinson**: 7 consecutive All-Pro teams. Also funnily enough changed contract rules in the NFL after a hilarious oversight  prevented the Seattle Seahawks from taking advantage of their right to match the Vikings offer or receive compensation. The Vikings offered  him  a contract that would  be humorously  expensive if the team signed another lineman to a  bigger  contract,  which would mean  that the Seahawks would not be able to field a team after  signing  Walter Jones to a bigger  contract. Hilariously,  the Seahawks retaliated by doing the same with Nate Burleson by including a clause that would bankrupt the team if Burleson ""played 5 or more games in the state of Minnesota"" 

* **Alan Faneca** 8 consecutive All-Pro teams.

C:

* **Jeff Saturday**: Saturday was a manager at a hardware store when his college roommate and for teammate took a brave  step into Bill Polian's office  and told him there's  a guy  back home who  can  kick  everyone's ass. Saturday never looked back and became one of the most iconic players of the 2000's

Edge:

*  **Jared Allen**: Looked like a lock for HOF after averaging 13 sacks per year for 10 years, but got pneumonia after 2 games with the Bears, lost 18 pounds, and was never the same despite just turning 32.

* **Robert Mathis**: Most strip sacks in NFL  history and a long career of threatening QBs.

IDL: 

* **Justin Smith**:  One of the best ever at pass rushing skill  that didn't convert to a ton of sacks. Legendary 2011 season.

* **Jerome Brown**: Arguably the best DT in the league at the time of his death, Brown was a key piece in what was  arguably the the greatest defense of all time with Reggie White and the 1991 Eagles. ""if you had 45 Jerome Browns, you would win every game"" - Buddy Ryan.

The last 5 yrs of his career his 16 game average was 1,398 yards rushing.

Ok but you assume the only best candidate for the job is a white male. You wouldn’t dare posts this about a white guy getting hired but you bring the skepticism with a POC or a woman. This country has a a history of being incredibly discriminatory in its hiring and application process. These moves help to break down those barriers and to provide access for people not able to reach that part of society. It’s only racist to you because your people haven’t had to  deal with that in this country in any real way. Just being adequate and white was enough to get by.

"Yeah, the last thing the NFL wants right now is to piss off every single fan within ten miles of social media (and probably any new fans you've recruited recently)

Can you fucking *imagine* the outrage? The NFL has never faced an in-season lockout *this century*, let alone in the social climate of the last few years or with social media even existing. I don't think they're prepared for the negative PR onslaught, especially because it touches on labor issues, which are a relatively hot political issue and it's only going to get hotter, so then it's not even just football fans who care about it.

If there's a strike, the NFL folds within three weeks, I'd put money on it. It'd be replacement refs all over again, amplified by several orders of magnitude.

The NFL is so fucking bad at PR there is no way a strike would be anything but a completely unmitigated catastrophe in terms of ""protecting the Shield"" and ""brand image""",nfl

One night, God looked down at all the millions and millions of people, man... ...and he decided which one was the best, and it was me. He plucked me from all those millions and millions of people, man. 

  


Dewey: -Yeah. 

  


AB: -Listen to this, right now. There's two things you need to know. I'm the King. And number two is: Look out, man! Look at that coming at you. You see that? It's called karate and only two kinds of people know it. The Chinese and the King. And one of them is me.

"Late to the party, but hopefully someone, especially the people accusing the cops and prosecutors of acting in bad faith, see this. It's pretty clear the bad actors are the defense attorneys here.

I suggest going to Palm Beach County Clerk's website and reading all the case documents, that's what I did. And it's very clear that the police did NOT bs a traffic stop of Kraft or anyone else. Kraft's attorneys accused the cop of saying he would ""make shit up"" as to probable cause on a stop of one of the other patrons of the spa.

First, he didn't say that, and he didn't do it. There was probable cause to stop the guy because they had seen him engage in a crime. They wanted PC of a traffic violation so they wouldn't tip off to the suspect that the spa was being watched. However, the only violation they saw was him rolling through a stop sign in the spa plaza, and they wanted something farther away, again, to protect the investigation. When he said he would make something up, he meant about why he pulled the guy over for running a stop sign almost 2 miles back. Second, what he made up was NOT the PC. He told the guy it was for rolling through the stop sign. The fake story was that an off duty cop had to slam on his breaks to avoid hitting the guy when he rolled through the stop sign, and that is what caused the delay between the infraction and the stop. He never said he would make shit up for PC, didn't make shit up, and it was for a different person than Kraft. There was no allegation that anyone falsified the reason for stopping Kraft either.

Finally, the entire exchange, and proof that he didn't say or do what Kraft's lawyers say he did and do, is caught on a body worn camera. A video we'd all already have access to if Kraft's attorneys hadn't (although I'll say it's fair given the circumstances) prevented the videos from being released.

So THOSE are the facts, no prosecutorial or police misconduct here.",nfl

"Let me preface this response by saying that I think the discounting coaches' performances by attributing their success to inherited teams is bogus. I was just describing an argument often used to say that Tomlin isn't as good of a coach as Cowher. 

Do we discount Sean McVay because he inherited Goff, Gurley, and Donald?  Do we discount Nagy because he inherited everyone not named Khalil Mack? Do we discount Anthony Lynn because he inherited Rivers? Do we discount Payton because he inherited Brees? I can go on. The only time I hear the word inherited used is in regard to Tomlin and I don't know why.  Bottom line is you still have to coach the team.

You're right. We haven't done much since the last Super Bowl appearance. But part of inheriting a good roster is the reality that those players are likely old and declining which was the case for our defense. There's no escaping the fact that we had to completely rebuild the defense, the oldset defense in the league at one point. So we had no chance at winning it all for a few years because we were only good on one side of the ball and, predictably, we didn't. Additionally, one of either Brown or Bell were hurt the last two deep runs we made and if either of those guys stayed healthy who knows what would have happened. Lastly, in the AFC you have to contend with the greatest dynasty in professional sports to make it to the Super Bowl so on that fact alone it's not completely surprising that we haven't been back recently. 

The bottom line is Tomlin has had nothing but success as a coach. Two thirds of the league would hire him immediately if given the opportunity. Looking forward to this year.",nfl

I just wonder how long he can keep that up? His body will slow down eventually, he's young now and he's certainly got quite a few more years, but all it takes is one injury or simply age and a lot of his hijinks simply won't be physically feasible anymore.

You're totally right about TD% being terrible.

Only thing I may dispute is the removal of throwaways being bad. I think most throwaways are because a QB senses fast pressure and gets rid of it, not because they held onto the ball too long. Then again, its even better if you find a checkdown for 4 yards. Overall though, I don't think including or removing them has a huge impact on making a stat better or worse.",nfl

Game 7 vs COL: Goal overturned with insufficient evidence of offsides during the switch. Avalanche would have had the game tied. This plus a no-call on blatant tripping against MacKinnon. The Avs not getting this powerplay, plus the game going back to a Sharks lead, gives the Sharks the advantage they use to win the game and the series.

Game 3 vs STL: Blatant hand pass. NHL admits it fucked up and tries to scrub the error away by removing four officials. This hand pass goal is the game winner for the Sharks.

Tell me again how the refs fucking up calls in two game sevens that directly led to the Sharks getting the win, plus another in the WCF, doesn't equal the Sharks being handed the wins?",nfl

I feel like it's whether or not they actually want to call it more than see it. Looking where the pass rusher is going is surely someone's job. The amount of times I've seen Von in a chokehold as he's bulldozing a guy only to get no call is absurd.,nfl
"While I don't disagree with you on the skill players, this 'rotation of OL' claim seems bogus to me. Thuney played 100% of offensive snaps, Andrews 98.5%, Trent Brown 97%, and Mason 85%. Only player who didn't play at least 3/4s of all snaps was Cannon at 74%.

Also, their projected starting LT was a rookie who never played an NFL down while Trent Brown ended up being a top flight OT in the league for them. You're just trying to make it sound worse than it actually was with that claim.",nfl
"The Ravens also did not have a lot to work with other than tight ends. It is part of the development of Jackson to develop him slowly. Other than the playoff game, I liked what i saw out of Jackson. 

I did not like what I saw out of Rosen last year. Hopefully, Miami can develop him. Interestingly enough, Rosen was the 'most pro ready' qb of the class and still needs a lot of work IMO. 

Miami is a simular situation as last year with Arizona, but with less weapons. 

I would take David Johnson, Christian Kirk, and Larry Fitz or Kenyon Drake, Devante Parker, and Kenny Stills.",nfl
"I'm not saying ranking is for everyone. I certainly didn't have time for it, and I sure as shit think that not ranking Brady was a mistake. I think the remainder of the list is taking the brunt of that boo-boo and...well...sucks to suck really.

That said, it's been a stickied thread for several years. Taking away the sticky devalues OC that has been a sub tradition. There weren't calls for the thread to go away (or lose its sticky) last year, or the year prior. At least not that I saw.

In addition, removing the sticky status could discourage future OC. We have this nice thread and a few sub series that people put a lot of work in. What if one year, just one guy gets something wrong. Suddenly another series falls because of one unpopular move.

Personally, I have no ties to this series aside from ranking it previously last year. Do I agree with the list? Honestly, I didn't do as much research as I did last year, but after seeing Brady go unranked I looked into his stats and...yeah...he should've been ranked IMO. Is he the only one that was ranked too low/high? I guarantee no. If he's ranked in the mid-40's on the list are we having this ""remove the sticky status"" discussion at all? I highly doubt it.

It's difficult to watch OC such as this be met with such ire from the users. We want to promote OC on the sub as that's what helps it grow. Removing the sticky status would be a slap in the face to the rankers (past/present/future) and a harbinger of things that could come to the other users that contribute to the sub.",nfl

* Abolish pre-season games. Let teams do private scrimmages with other teams if they want, but training camp is up to them.
* A team is guaranteed a BYE week before they play a Thursday night game
* 9 home games, 9 away games, and 1 neutral site game per week (London could have all 19 games for all I care)
* Expand roster sizes, both active gameday and inactive
* 6 divisional games, 4 against NFC division, 4 against AFC division, 2 against common opponents in NFC, 3 against common opponents in AFC (these are the 3 additional games)

"I'd argue that he was really efficient to be honest. 

First, if you extrapolate his raw stat average over 16 games instead of 12 he ends with: 4 or 5 less targets than Julio, the same receptions/game as Antonio Brown, the same yardage total as Michael Thomas. He'd end up with 8 TDs which is, granted, relatively low. But his yards per route run is 8th in the NFL at 2.26. He got 4.25 1st downs per game and he helped move the chains more than many other receivers did last season. Drops weren't a huge issue with him either. I didn't rank him because I used a threshold of 13 games or more to rank a player, but I don't think it's accurate to describe him as inefficient.",nfl
"Doubling the rookie pay scale means the #1 pick gets 60 mil guaranteed. The point of the Rookie payscale was to prevent draft picks from sucking up tons of cap space like that.

I feel corner is also going to be a huge liability.  I think Trumaine Johnson will actually have a better year with Gregg Williams as his DC but other than him there's essentially nothing.

"https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/pro-the-top-101-players-from-the-2018-nfl-season

Brady is 7?

EDIT:

My reasoning for Luck vs Brady is that they had almost identical statlines for the year, but Luck had better offensive players around him (TY is ranked, no skills for Brady will be ranked, Nelson is going to be rated higher than Mason, probably no other Pats OL and maybe more Colts OL and Gronk's reanimated corpse vs Ebron).

When asked in the HM thread, many rankers justified ranking Luck over Brady because if you throw out Luck's first 6 games he blew Brady's whole season out of the water.  But there are many players that look good if you only look at their best 10 games so you shouldn't do that with one player and not others.  I think Luck and Brady are similar and should be within 10 of each other and I'm siding with Brady on getting the better of Luck in that matchup.",nfl
"Honest answer: he's a 3rd stringer right now for the Vikings and he barely belongs there. He had 30 or so receptions this past year and it isn't because Theilen/Diggs/Kyle Rudolph steal all the looks. He just can't run routes that well and create seperation.

&amp;#x200B;

He got 30+ receptions because Cousins almost forced him the ball. His 5th year wasn't picked up I believe and this will more then likely be his last season on the team.",nfl
"&gt; Every receiver in the game has had sub 50 yard games.

Amari had 7 sub-40 yard games this year. AB had 1. OBJ had 1. Davante Adams had 0.

Amari has 24 sub-40 yard games in his career of 4 seasons. No true top receiver is close to that.

You're just being willfully ignorant to the undeniable fact that Amari Cooper is unbelievably inconsistent and disappears in games far more often than other receivers who put up similar or better numbers. Raiders fans have been saying this for years and that's a big reason why he was traded. It's awesome to have him when he's having one of his handful of huge games every year. But it's hard for coaches to deal with and scheme for their WR1 when they know that receiver is more likely to have a vacant game than an impactful one.",nfl
"&gt; I think it puts the other players in an interesting situation where they have to decide between loyalty to a team or loyalty to themselves.

I don't think any but the most foolish NFL players actually consider ""loyalty to the team"" during contract negotiations.  Every season they see half the guys who show up get culled before the season even starts, and every year multiple guys they played the whole year with are let go from the team.  They watch guys get maimed _every single weekend_, and most of them sustain life-altering injuries themselves.  After 4 years an average team has turned over, what 40+ of the 53 roster spots?

You can't ignore, as a player, the fact that the team isn't ""loyal"" to players (nor should they be).  The league is about results, and for a player that window is small.  For many of these guys this is about setting up their kids for a comfortable life, choosing to not do that (or at least do it less effectively) for a team you know would cut you in an instant as soon as they think you aren't ""worth it"" probably doesn't even cross their mind.",nfl

"Jared Goff the MVP candidate? Say what? Fucking lol, it was Mahomes/Brees and no one else even close.  And Goff was only an MVP candidate because of QB Winz, his stats were good, but not comparable to Brees/Mahomes at any point.  And oh did Brady win the Superbowl? Glad that's a great indicator of his personal play.  The actual Superbowl was one of his worst games this season, not to mention that postseason isn't something that all rankers take into account, just like the other regular season official NFL awards like the Pro Bowl, All-Pros, and MVP/OPOY/DPOY. 

That was one of some steps that we took, and a large chunk of us, though I can't speak for everyone or know exactly what they did, were very wary of using PFF grades on positions, and used them only lightly.  The only position where I'd say I did end up using them more than I would've liked is OL.

And that's just the statistical/grade portion of our rankings, we (or a lot of us including me at least) also watch film to understand what the stats are saying and why they're saying it.  I personally tend to value metrics as the more important variable in their final rank, and use film to give more context, but others do it the other way around.

Lol, did you just shit on PFF, and then praise it in the following sentence? PFF has no idea how to use their grades across positions, as evidenced by the fact that they had 23 WRs with a grade over 80.0 in their system, but 2 OGs and 1 C.

Lmao that is a wide sweeping generalization, there are much more of us that watch tape, and almost everyone, PFF, our rankers, PlayerProfiler, and other various combinations of film charting, film grades, or advanced analytics, put Brady as QB5 at the very max, and more around QB7-8.  Just because there's one film guy who had a grade way outside the norm that benefits your favorite player, you're just going to latch onto him as the word of god? Cool.  He also had Brees QB5, which is imo, easily a ludicrous take for the 2nd team All-Pro that just shattered the NFL record for comp % while putting up the 6th highest passer rating of all-time (obv not era-adjusted), and by the PFF source you trust, was the #1 QB last season.

You literally haven't tried to understand any of the arguments we've put up if that's what you're getting out of it.  Football Outsider's DYAR stat puts Brady at 8th on the year, QBR puts him 6th, passer rating puts him 10th, ANY/A puts him 7th, offensive points per drive was 8th and yards per drive was 9th.  But somehow you've taken all of that and randomly arrived at Brady being a top 5 QB because fuck it, let's only pay attention to stats that make our QB look better.  Because that's a good way to deal with your world view, ignore all evidence that doesn't support your pre-existing biased viewpoint, and tunnel in on whatever supports what you like and makes you feel good.",nfl

A lot of Kingsbury's offense at Tech was about getting the ball to fast guys in space and having them make guys miss and stuff, but against Georgia and non-garbage tier comp, Isabella really didn't seem great short area and bursting through contact and stuff.

I hope I'm wrong, but he really seems like pretty much a deep route only kinda guy to me.",nfl
"Let’s also ignore the TD discrepancy as a metric of who’s more deserving of a place on this list, right? How Hunt played 5 less games and still had more TDS between receiving and rushing. 

Better yet, let’s look at the entire picture since this is a comparison of where they should rank as RBs right now. 

Over the 2 years they’ve both been in the league they’ve both put up 3 thousand yards from scrimmage with Kareem hunt reaching the end zone 5 more times while still playing 5 less games. 

Either way you cut this Hunt has been more successful.",nfl
"That study simply states that abuse and corporal punishment can have an adverse effect, not that the adverse effects are on the same level of severity.  It’s like saying drinking 2 drinks and then driving is the same as drinking 4 drinks and then driving.

Both are not something you should do, but the latter carries a higher risk of consequences.

Anyhow, I don’t think we disagree on corporal punishment. It’s been shown that there are many other disciplinary measures that are more effective and don’t emotionally harm the child. I consider it to be lazy parenting, but our view is not the same as others.

Some people don’t take the time to do their research in that regard, they ARE lazy parents. But that doesn’t put them on the same level as an actual abuser.

My flair may indicate bias FOR Adrian, but in reality I’ve simply seen both sides of the coin. My stepfather was abusive and he beat my mother and I because he was a piece of shit, not because he thought what he was doing would make us a better person in the long run.

That’s why I am not willing to condemn Adrian in the manner that many do, he legitimately believes that he is doing the right thing and that changes how I feel about him as a human being.

CPS would be involved if they felt the child was at risk. But they don’t, so they are not.  With how high profile he is, they are going to be sure to do it by the books.

I certainly don’t agree with his methods, but I don’t think he’s a monster either.",nfl

"I prefer film lol, but thank you. I was looking for something to try to back this up....anything really. 

Not to nitpick, but Smith led in fumble recoveries, tfl and had only .5 sack less than Adams. So clearly he led in at least some categories. 

His stats are so close to both Byard and Adams, but he does so much more than either of those two do on defense. Adams is incredibly versatile, but he’s Harrison Smith lite. Harrison Smith covers receivers, tight ends and running backs, rushes the passer, lines up at defensive end, alot coverage, is an elite tackler and run stuffer, is much better at play recognition than either of those two (something that film shows and your typical stats do not) and he changes plays on the fly, which is something that neither Byard or Adams has even sniffed yet. 

Kevin Byard is known as a run stuffing safety. He excels at it, and had the second highest grade as a run stopper among qualifying safeties. Harrison Smith had the number one grade. 

Harrison Smith has the highest grade as a tackler as well, whereas Byard not Adams were top 5. 

He is the best player on a defense that is on a completely different level than the Titans or the Jets. 

You failed to mention those things and went for the classic argument of tackles, interceptions and purely numbers. It’s tells part of the story but not nearly all of it. 

Again, Harrison Smith is the best safety in the league, but only Eddie Jackson and Derwin James should be above him for 2018.",nfl

"I'm not saying that winning a SB means automatic inclusion in a top 100 list, but I think rankers need a bit more qualitative analysis included.


I think everyone is trying to tightly control for measures they can compare across players, but performance is a lot more messy than that. Playoffs aren't included because they can't be accounted for everyone, individual games aren't accounted for because they can't be done for everyone, dome stats aren't accounted for because it's difficult to normalize for dome benefits. Just because it doesn't fit neatly into a box doesn't mean that it should be disregarded.


But the Alex Smith example is a good one. He had close to a 105 passer rating 2 seasons ago, but they weren't a dynamic offense from game to game. His passer rating in that case didn't represent the quality of his performance from game to game, which I'd argue is the same case for Brady this year.",nfl

In a perfect world where we can guarantee that the intrinsic quality of play in the 80s and 2010s was the same that would be true but the reality is that modern players are better today and the 20th best player at whatever position in 2019 is likely better than the 20th best player at that position in 1982. An era adjusted rate of 140 in the early 1940s with players that didn't care about training nearly as much and many of whom were overseas in the military instead of playing in the NFL does not hold the same weight as someone getting a 140 next year.,nfl

"I’m not sure it’s applicable here but as far as I’m aware certain numbers on offense are not allowed to catch the ball, which is why for jumbo packages with a sixth linemen they announce the extra guy as an eligible receiver (since they are essentially the tight end on the play). The NFL has the numbers that way to make life easier on the refs. In the case of guys like Montgomery he went from one pass catching position to another so there was no problem. QBs also run into the 3rd QB rule, which if I’m remembering correctly means if your third string QB comes onto the field you can’t put your starter back in for the remainder of the game. Not sure if that is determined by jersey number or some sort of submitted depth chart to the league.

"People aren't arguing that the Broncos are being insulted. We're arguing that Stapleton (and you) are wrong that if you ""love"" a guy there should apparently be no upper limit to what you spend on them, and if you don't draft them as early as possible that means you don't think they could be your future franchise QB. Elway has ""loved"" Lock through the entire draft process and had him ranked as the No. 1 QB the entire time, but he was unwilling to pay an unnecessarily high price for him. You can *love* him but not *need* him. His reward for not overpaying was that he got him for much cheaper, along with multiple other first-round talents for his troubles.

By the way, there are no generational QB talents in this draft, so any GM that ""loves"" one of these QBs to the point that they're wasting irrationally high draft picks and passing on Josh Allen-caliber players to not even have to  *risk* losing one of them (here's looking at you, Gettleman) were actually being idiots. Gettleman may get lucky, or not, but it was an incredibly high-risk move to pick Jones that high. People keep acting like it's a huge risk to *not* draft their guy early, while conveniently ignoring the high risk to use a #6 draft pick on an extremely uncertain QB that nobody on Earth but Gettleman and Jones's mom think are the best QB in the draft.",nfl

"Aight thanks, and that's a completely fair point, I mean it doesn't even take a reanalysis, just a change in how some people evaluate positions to push Brady up.  I had Brady QB7 for example, and for a lot of people, a QB7 would usually go into the 75-100 range, even MTC who runs the whole thing said he'd have Brady there.

But yeah, for Hughes do you think he should be higher or lower? And imo the worst rank so far was Eric Ebron, I thought he was far too high.

Regardless thanks for keeping an open mind and keeping the discussion active, that's the best part of the list imo.  Do agree with having to balance film and stats, over the years I've slowly transitioned from basic stats -&gt; advanced and basic stats with better weighting -&gt; the prior mentioned stats approach with some film that I used this year, and I'm trying to find the right balance this year.  I do think that a balance between the two is needed for sure.",nfl
"I noticed this, too, over the last few years: very few teams have an absolutely awful QB situation.  The more I thought about it, though, the more I began to think that this is actually a function of offense becoming much easier after all of the rule changes, coupled with us still using old ways of evaluating quarterbacks.  20 years ago, if a guy had a passer rating over 100, he was a legitimate stud.  Last year, Ryan Fitzpatrick had a passer rating over 100.  We need a new way to evaluate quarterbacks so that we can say things like ""Tannehill just isn't a good quarterback in the modern NFL,"" instead of being tricked into thinking he's good because he had back-to-back 4K passing seasons, or because his career passer rating is higher than Marino, Kelly, Elway, and Favre.",nfl

"There have been 2 first round picks ever taken by the league as punishment. Both against the Patriots. You can say these penalties “aren’t shit,” but both instances were the most punitive penalties in NFL history, the second of which was doled out for something that likely never happened. The Falcons got caught actually cheating the same year as deflategate and their entire punishment was less severe than the least of the Patriots lost draft selections. Hell, the Vikings or Panthers (forget which one, but those were the teams in the game) literally got caught ON VIDEO tampering with balls and got a nice reminder letter from the league saying “please don’t do that.” The league does not have the Patriots back and there is a decade of evidence showing as much.",nfl
"Football Outsiders is purely an efficiency rating, which is why you get odd rankings like that. Brown's efficiency (in terms of per target) was fairly poor, but a lot of that was coming from Ben throwing him a disproportionate amount of uncatchable balls.

"IMO the Giants were pretty even with the Patriots in 2007. Pats had a close win over them near the end of the season.

Pats had a revolutionary offense that sparked the slot receiver craze. Giants were the first ones to figure out how to stop it. They also could take advantage of the Pats’ weaknesses (like interior pressure). 

IMO 2007 Pats were the greatest team ever. They were great on paper, had the highest point differential ever and tied for best record ever. Their loss just came at the wrong time, and they played a team particularly suited to beat them.",nfl
"I would hardly say his arm is a marshmallow. He's always had that weird side-arm motion to begin with, and I don't really notice any significant drop off in arm strength. Rivers' bread and butter is reading defenses and making adjustments at the line. 

I think the Chargers have just as good a chance as any AFC team besides the Pats to go to the Super Bowl.

But realistically, look at the AFC the last 15 years. Other than the Ravens once, only Ben or Peyton teams have gone to the SB.

All 3 times Ben went to the SB he got to avoid playing the Pats altogether (And in 2008 Brady had the ACL tear)

Both times Peyton Manning's teams won the SB, he didn't play particularly well in either postseason and had some great performances from his defense.

I think his weapons are better than you think too. Adams, Aaron Jones and Allison I think are obvious but also think they have good WR depth with St. Brown and Kumero.

Do rule changes make it easier to contract defensive penalties against defensive backs? Yes

Do defensive backs play the ball softer due to that? Yes

Does the softer coverage allow an easier time passing the ball? Yes",nfl

For example, [Trubisky comes in at 6 on this list (he just missed the tweet by one slot) ](https://www.sharpfootballstats.com/aerial-passing-distance--off-.html) And it makes sense right? Our receivers were solid, but they were rarely breaking off big YAC.

Then you have Pat Mahomes who is 29th on this same list, almost the bottom of the league, but it also makes sense because he had such elite play makers to throw to. If Tyreek broke off a seventy yard run no one was surprised.

Ultimately I don't think it means much. And it's definitely a case by case basis.",nfl
"Joe Thomas once pointed out that he likes using the RB Efficiency stat for measuring RBs, where the standard is (going from memory here) 60% of their carries qualify as 4 YPC, a first down, or a touchdown.

"Ok, you don’t understand what I’m saying. Mathematics and What actually happens are two separate things. A simple way to explain it is to look at it as a coin. If you flip a coin the MATHEMATICAL probability of getting either heads or tails is 50%. But if you do it 100 times, there’s a decent chance you will not get 50 of each, hell, you could end up with something like 80/20, and THAT is the real life statistic. So sure, right now we’re at 51% but that’s not the actual chances, the NFL has just been really lucky. My fix would be to make it a full quarter (shortened) and winner takes all, or at the very least allow both offenses and both defenses to play at least once.

"Relative to a top-3 WR under extensive team control and in his prime? Yes, a solid SS, a very late 3rd, and 17 is very little.

I think that's my favorite SB ever. I've watched every one since Dallas V Pittsburgh. It broke my heart though. Kurt Warner was probably my favorite player when I first started *really* getting into football and following it more closely. Would have made such an epic story for him to win at the end of his career like that.,nfl
"His cap number over this year and the previous 3 which are all the same contract he signed 4 years ago is $76m which is an annual cap hit of $19m which is far below market value currently.  Just because the Patriots can always resructure his contract to take his cap hit when they want doesnt mean he isnt playing way under market value.  He had 2 years where his cap hit was $14m or less.  That is a huge discount.  


If you only want to look at this year and not how they planned out his contract exactly this way to have 1 big cap hit in the last year of his deal, then yea you're right.  He isnt playing *that* far under market value.  But if you look at his contract and understand how they intended it to work, he is/has been playing way under market value.",nfl

"I’d disagree here. 

I think the cowboys have enough weapons for Dak in Cooper, Gallup and Cobb, plus Zeke is going to catch a lot of balls and take a lot of touches anyways in that offense.

Jarwin proved himself to be a serviceable TE, and Witten is going to be steady and reliable, as always.

And the iDL situation, they’ve got a good starter at NT in Antwuan Woods, the only position they needed was a 3T, who they drafted in Trysten Hill. 

I think overall that roster is very good, however their success really does rely on whether Dak shits the bed or not.",nfl

"It's hard for me to say for sure, but I think it's a combination of Brady getting older and more experienced and those Ravens defenses just being something otherworldly.  I mean, those teams were really talented and also really well coached, with spectacular play calling.  

I think in a smaller part, Brady after his injury in 2008, was a little jumpy for a few years and the Ravens (and Jets under Ryan, and Giants in the Superbowls) were able to exploit that and make him uncomfortable.  Even when he was playing really well, he would throw a couple extra balls away before he had to, or duck well before a defender got home.  Some teams couldn't make him pay for these mistakes but I think the Ravens did.  

I wonder too if offensive line play, with more athletic tight ends kind of caught up to some of the stunts those defenses were running.  I think that's better answered by someone smarter than me, but it seems like the game has kind of shifted a little from those power fronts.  Or at least, it seems like the pats learned and countered them quite a bit (too bad we couldn't counter Von Miller and CO in '15).

I don’t think Fant was ever supposed to compete with and beat out Ifedi last year. Russ even said himself that using Fant as that big bodied tight end is what really made our run game so effective.

Yes, he can be your guy at 10 or 15 and you get an extra pick...  If he keeps devaluing draft positions, and draft capital in general, the more savvy GM's are going to eat his lunch.

Dude there is just no winning. Today I saw the argument that there was no way that the Eagles and Jets could have wanted Wilson because they didn't pick him in the first two rounds. Both teams thought it would be better to wait for him to fall to their pick and they missed out. But that's not what you do for a QB you want.

Then when teams like Bears or Giants make sure they get their guy they are overdrafting and become memes.

Not only that, Eagles and Jets were dumb for not drafting Wilson in first two rounds because of height issues (which is true), but now the Cards are dumb for spending the first pick on someone with a height issue. Obviously these opinions are from different people, but they're all upvoted. My theory is its just because of the competitor teams. It's weird.

A pitcher isn’t the most vital position on the team because he can’t pitch every game. A Qb on the other hand is part of every offensive play. Cy Young award was for pitchers as MVP odds are a SOB. The Starr Award should be for QB’s only then and exclude them from the MVP award..,nfl

"I just wish we got a bit of analysis on Harry beyond “I had others graded higher and we’ll just have to wait and see who was right.”  

  
Harry has his limitations, but his ball skills and YAC ability should help him fit right in to our offense. We carved out plenty of designed touches for Dorsett and Patterson last year, we can sure do it for a bigger guy with better actual receiver skills. Specific to the WRs he named, Hollywood and AJ Brown had similar grades from me, while Metcalf is the epitome of the boom/bust big play guy we have never really had or wanted and felt like a terrible potential fit for us. Butler to me seems to have the exact same downsides as Harry where the trade off is a bit of size for significantly better RAC ability and ST contributions.  
  
I’m not about to die on the hill that he was the absolute best possible pick we could have made, but I would have liked some actual analysis on how he fits what we do offensively like we got for the rest of the picks.",nfl

The 7.33 NYPA is pretty good, but the rushes are really bad, and the TD-INT-Fumble line of 24-16-10 is mediocre. He's also one of the worst QBs in the league at avoiding big hits, and is coming off a torn ACL.

The Rams D definitely stepped up that game for sure.",nfl

"I was initially annoyed, but I've grown on the pick since then. Considering the team felt that it was better to play a clearly injured Cam than the backups through our 1-7 slide, it's clear they don't have too much trust in our backups. Grier was one of the better QBs in the draft, getting him at pick 100 was a steal. Cam is looking very healthy right now, but if something bad happens down the road, they'll put in Grier. I doubt he'll be actively competing with Cam for the starting role in these next few seasons. He was also my favorite college QB to watch last season, so there's that.",nfl

You don't have a gripe against the Rams. It's not like it was the Rams' fault that they got the call.

"I would say the up and down years would be better attributed to the passing game weapons as well. When the WR corps is obliterated, the stats are poor. When we have a full strength offense or Megatron, the stats are good. 

However, I would say the absolute lack of a running game puts more importance on the passing weapons, and leaves little wiggle room for injuries or other changes for the worse to the receiving corps. 

If we would have only lost Golden last year, I think his stats would have been better, since Kerryon provided the wiggle room necessary for the offense to still produce. But then we lost Kerryon, and on top of that lost Marvin. So yeah, the stats suffered.",nfl

It’s not until 2017 when the Saints draft Lattimore that they rank above the Raiders in defense. For two consecutive years, Cam played with record breaking bad secondaries. 

During that time Mack has had 2 team mates make the pro bowl (Charles Woodson and Reggie Nelson - reserve) where Cam has had 1 (Marshon Lattimore as a reserve). Cam made 3 pro bowls to Mack’s 2 just FYI.

Yeah I dont really get people saying the 49ers would've blown them out. It's all about matchups and our D matched perfectly with their offense. We had the perfect athletes in our secondary to match up against their weapons and in general we were just at our fucking best in that game. I dont think theres very many teams in history that could have beat us on that day. Peyton would have been able to throw against their defense. It probably would have been a close back and forth game and either team could have come out on top.,nfl

"With how pass-happy the NFL is I definitely think CB is a more important position than ILB now. 

Outside of the biggest TEs they can cover any potential pass-catcher and the value of a good CB being able to play the opposing team's best receiver 1-on-1 is huge. LBs are obviously better at stopping the run but the D-Line has a bigger part to play in good run defense than either of the other groups. 

Right now there are 11 CBs making more per year than the #2 ILB (Luke), and since 2015 there have been 17 corners drafted in the 1st round as opposed to 9 ILBs. 

Guys like Kuechly are the exception since he can cover, stop the run and is great at putting guys in the right spots. But he's a 6x All-Pro and well on his way to being a first ballot HoFer. Him and Wagner are in a tier of their own, and there have only been maybe 4-5 other guys at the position that have matched their impact in the last 20 years.

Outside of Luke and Wagner the value of ILBs drops significantly imo. Mosely is probably the best one after them, and I legitimately think there are about 15 CBs I'd take over him to build my defense around.

In certain packages these days teams might have as many as 5 CBs on the field. There are certain situations/formations that may not require any ILBs to be playing.",nfl

In my opinion context adds to the story here.  Firstly, without looking at the stats I would say Peyton played with better RB's from 01-07 than Brady did.  Brady had Corey Dillon and a good season from Antawain Smith, and Peyton had James and Rhodes.

If you have something specific the Jets should have done differently against a normal pro style offense then go ahead. Baker played much better than I expected. There were 2 or 3 drops where the WRs weren't ready for how quickly the ball got to them. If you expect a rookie QB, even the number 1 overall, to throw for 300 to 400 yards on a completion % over 70 for a full game on his NFL debut than I don't know what to tell you. Your expectations for QB rookies and the offensive side of the ball are too high and way too low for the defense. Even if they didn't have tape on the kid.",nfl

"I'd respect the fuck out of them. I respect the fuck out of them anyways though. It is none of our business what a guy does on the weekend. If they're doing steroids I also dont care. If they want to sacrifice their bodies to the possible side effects later in life to entertain us that's sounds like a very even trade. It's actually way more beneficial to the NFL. If a player got caught up doing the same thing Kraft did he'd be ended. But that's not how it is for playsers. If their performance is x/million a year then it is worth x/million a year in my opinion. If they are coked out and their performance slips then their team can cut them. Thats how it works in the real world. If I show up drunk to frame up a house tomorrow and start fucking up on the clock then I'll get fired. These players arent showing up to work drunk and not performing, they are getting nitpicked at. The league wants to hand out their ""ironfist of justice"" all the while the NFL itself has a super shady version of justice. Contracts are often not player friendly anyways. Even if the player walks a straight line they can be cut and lose most of those contracts. People bitch and moan about how many millions the players make and they should be thankful but the players arent making near enough of the percentage off of the billions  the league and individual owners are raking in off them. Roger goodell doesn't need to step into be everyone's daddy. Everyone's got problems. Most of those people don't rape and murder and abuse people, yet the people that do that the NFL is surprisingly cool with. These personal choices people make for themselves I'm cool with. The players that harm others do not fall in the same category because they are taking personal choice out of another person's personal choice and that is not a victimless crime. NFL players getting fucked over because they smoke a joint are committing victimless crimes. The only people getting victimized are these players themselves because they are giving their all to the NFL's hundreds of billions of dollars of business, and then these players are getting nothing in return when the NFL decides to strike their hypocritical ban hammer. It blows my mind that we seem to accept the NFL's narritave that they care about these players, because they obviously dont give a shit about anything moral or good.  They certainly dont care about the fans, and they also certainly dont care about these young men that are their players and the real reason we all enjoy watching football.",nfl

"All I got from this is, “maybe they will, maybe they won’t. idk.”

I don’t think they’ll live in shotgun because I think it’s in their best interest to have Kyler not be a threat to run every snap in a way that inflicts the most damage to his body (bootlegs/rollouts &gt; options/rpo’s). 

In shotgun, you lose that slow developing handoff that hides the ball away from the defense which in turn makes playaction very effective because the 2nd/3rd level holds in place until the Qb/RB mesh is completed. 

But you can replicate it by making the QB an option threat to keep it and create play action out of it. 

So it really depends if KK is comfortable having his undersized prized-asset taking those hits. Maybe Murray shows that he can thrive as a featured ball carrier and make the NFL rethink how much they’ll have their QB carry the ball (if they’re athletic enough).",nfl
If the Broncos hold on to win that game in 2012 Joe would still have some pretty impressive postseason numbers and a solid first six or seven years of his career. He'd be far from a joke. Eli would still have been above average. You're just suffering from recency bias.,nfl
"Problem is, that's it. Not only are we playing our guys out of their natural position every snap, there is 0 depth behind them. We'd have to cut 3 of our DEs, since none of them fit 3-4, and we'd need at least 3 more linemen, 2 34DEs and another 34DT.

People downvoting me don't realize that this isn't Madden. You can't just go into the player's settings and change them from one scheme to another.

&gt; why are you surprised

Why would I be surprised?  I'm not at all surprised by it.  I just personally don't like the concept of changing officiating in baseball to a bunch of computers.  I used to, and then I saw that adding replay fixed some things, but made the games less fun.  I started learning more and more of the little parts of gamesmanship that are part of the game as a whole, and found that many parts add a lot of positive complexity to the game.  I don't see a point in seeing a guy be called out because even though he beat the ball to the bag, a slight bounce off of the rubber 2nd base during a slide took his foot off the bag by a sliver of space before his leg got there too.  That's not the point of that rule, and it's not fun to stop a game to get that call. 

&gt; I said I kinda liked the strategy but it's still manufactured strategy that isn't conducive to the game itself.

It's all manufactured strategy.  The whole game is.  And it's conducive in the sense that it adds complexity to the game.  No two games will ever be the same because the players have to adjust to a ton of little differences.  There's strategy to see that underlies the basics of a play.  That's a good thing, not a bad one.  

Note: this doesn't mean that officiating shouldn't change to get better (especially in football), but just that many parts of the game are better with real officials.  And note, my fandom is biased, as while I'm a fan at the professional level, I'm also an umpire.",nfl
"The AAF's OT was kind of cool.  Each team got a first-and-ten from their opponent's ten yard line and one drive to try for a TD and a two-point conversion.  If they were still tied after each team had had a chance, the game ended in a tie.",nfl
"This is the thing a lot of ""analysts"" don't get I think. They just look at the stats and say this guy was picked too high, but Pettine's scheme needs versatile guys like Gary and he's a top 2 or 3 athlete in the draft. He does have flaws when you look at the tape, so it's a bit of a gamble since you're counting on the coaching staff to make him a better player, but his ceiling is absurdly high, so I think it's a risk we could take since we had 2 first rounders.",nfl

"The fumble by jameis at the 1min mark was doug's fault, he read the coverage wrong and didn't do his job. In koetter's offense, every play requires the QB, all eligible receivers and the C to make pre and post-snap adjustments to their routes. 

on this play, the options were hump in the flat on a quick screen if the coverage was up on evans, a quick out to evans if the coverage was off and the fake handoff was only supposed to be a thing if the safety looked like he was going to drop into zone coverage.

they took evans away, so evans adjusted by blocking, the safety was in the box almost at the snap so that means no play action and the play was going to be to hump.

it's a great example of why koetter's offense was explosive but impossible to run any better than jameis and fitz ran it. tons of options mean tons of ways to blow up a play. a bunch of jameis' picks and fumbles were mistakes by someone else in how they read the defense. this offense is similar in responsibility to what jameis ran at FSU, most of the rest of these guys had never ran anything like it before.",nfl

Barry was 9 yards short of 5 straight seasons with 1500 yards rushing.  He had 10 straight 1,000 yard seasons.  I think the 4 straight 1,500 is still a record.  Emmit had 11 straight seasons of 1,000 yards and Curtis Martin also 10 straight years of 1,000.  Barry had a streak of 14 straight 100 yard rushing games in his 2000 yard season.

"The problem isn't that if you're double teamed four feet behind the line you're less likely to hit the shot. The problem is that if you're even one foot in front of the line, *it's worth fifty percent more* to go hunting for a three, even if it's contested.

Most of the scenarios where the midrange is better are at the end of the shot clock where there aren't other options. If there's time on the clock, an NBA offense can move the ball enough to create at least a contested three, and as long as it's contested by one person, you're still better off taking the shot because it's worth 50% more and the person taking it won't be 50% less likely to hit it than you were to hit the midrange.

I don't completely agree. I think the pay2win system in the NBA and MLB is more effective. I think the NFL is equally as pay2win as the MLB/NBA, but it's just harder to successfully build a team in general so the money is less effective. It's the same idea as I was talking about earlier. It's easy to buy 3 players and win in the NBA. You only have 9-10 other guys to fill your roster. Those 3 players are 60% of your court and they play 85% of the game. That's like 50% of the players you'll have on the court. In the NFL, you buy 3 players QB, CB, DE. You still have 10 other players on offense, mainly the o line, that need to be adequate. NFL doesn't run on star power to the extent the other two leagues do and it's harder to buy success because of it.

Second, Zeke has been huge in Daks development. His combination of running ability, pass catching and blocking has taken a ton of pressure off Dak. Remember what happened when he got suspended last year? Dak basically became the offense and it was not pretty. Without Zeke I have no idea where the QB position would be right now in Dallas.

He doesn't have the accolades nor the stats to be a hall of famer, nor did he have any greater impact than any great returners before him except edging them out in scores. And at such a low touchdown number, a few scores are really a negligible statistical anomoly.",nfl
His favoritism towards a multiple zone scheme is well established his entire coaching career. Arizona was the first place his inability to change his scheme to his personnel backfired on him. He’s going to need to incorporate a lot more man coverage schemes into his play calls if Cleveland is going to be successful on defense.,nfl

"The old Packers Sweep with Paul Hornung is another good example of this. They would run the same play 10 times in a row because nobody could stop it. Who cares if they know what’s coming? They still can’t do anything about it.

"How can you call his argument dumb when your own argument for Graham is based off stats adjusted for era?

"https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/tdc18/how_steve_bartman_might_have_caused_the_recent/  
  
The Steve Bartman incident will forever and always be my favorite butterfly effect in all of sports.  I’ll quote the whole post here:
  
&gt;	Follow along on a story I’ve told a couple times before at social gatherings and tailgates...

&gt;	Game 6 of the 2003 NLCS was on October 14, 2003. We all know what happened, so I’m not going to recount the happenings that horrible night, nor the eventual Game 7 loss the next equally horrible night.

&gt;	Since the Florida Marlins advanced to the World Series following the Cubs’ collapse, they still needed use of their baseball field. At the time, they shared Sun Life Stadium with the Miami Dolphins (an arrangement fans of both teams felt was less than ideal. Because they still needed to use their baseball field, the dirt diamond had to remain for an extra week or two.

&gt;	On October 19, 2003 the Miami Dolphins hosted the New England Patriots. Olindo Mare, the Dolphins’ sure-footed (at that time) kicker, missed two game-winning kicks in the 4th quarter. Both kicks were missed because Mare slipped on the infield dirt of the Marlins’ infield. New England went on to win the game in overtime. The Dolphins would end the season with a 10-6 record, missing the playoffs by one game.

&gt;	The coach of the Dolphins at the time was Dave Wannstedt. Following the 2003 postseason, a second straight postseason without the Dolphins after not missing since 1996, some Dolphins left the team and the team was restructured. Pair that with a poor draft by Wannstedt and company, and 2004 started rough. With Miami’s record an embarrassing 1-8, Dave Wannstedt left the team. Two months later, he became coach at Pitt.

&gt;	In his third season at Pitt, Wannstedt took his team 75 miles south to play #2 West Virginia in the final game of the 2007 season. I’m not going to go into the painful detail here, but we all know Wannstedt pulled a rabbit out of his hat and somehow vaulted that 4-7 team to a victory that night. I’ve never heard 60k people more silent in my life. I don’t think I spoke a word until I had gotten far from the stadium.

&gt;	The loss knocked WVU out of the national title game, and knocked LSU in. LSU had been upset a week earlier by rival Arkansas, or they would’ve been in to begin with. The following week, WVU’s head coach Rich Rodriguez left the program to coach at Michigan.nnLSU went on to win the national championship, in what would become the second of six straight (and current) for the SEC.

&gt;	I (along with many others) believe if WVU had won that game against Pitt, Rich Rodriguez. What coach would leave right before coaching his alma mater in what could’ve been their first national title? If Rodriguez wouldn’t have taken the job, many believe Michigan would’ve gotten Les Miles to take over. It would’ve been easier to pry him away after a disappointing loss against their rival and a “routine” Sugar Bowl appearance.

&gt;	So, the national championship would’ve either gone to the Big East (WVU) or Big Ten (Ohio State) that night, and LSU may have been forced to reload their staff that offseason. SEC schools couldn’t have used their” X-straight titles” angle for 2008 and forward. LSU has been involved in many important SEC games since then. Who knows how they might have turned out, and how that would’ve affected the end-of-season #1 and #2 from 2008 til now.

&gt;	Admittedly, the biggest stretch of this story is whether or not missing the playoffs in 2003 caused the rough offseason which saw good players leave, and a 10-6 team start 1-8 and lose their coach (who never would’ve left in the middle of a good season). I believe it did.

&gt;	Disclaimer: I am a lifelong WVU, Chicago Cubs, and Miami Dolphins (to a lesser extent) fan. If I were the type of person to blame Steve Bartman for the loss that night, I would probably be one of his biggest haters. Fortunately (for him) I blame some pitching and fielding mistakes late in the game for the eventual Game 6 loss.

&gt;	And FWIW I’m not complaining... Just sharing a cfb anecdote.

&gt;	TL;DR: Since the Marlins got to the World Series, they needed to keep their infield dirt on the Dolphins field. The dirst caused the Dolphins’ kicker to slip and miss 2 game-winning FGs, and they lost and game and missed the playoffs by 1 game. A shitty offseason, precipitated by missing the playoffs again, resulted in a 1-8 start for Miami, and their coach (Dave Wannstedt) left midseason and signed with Pitt a month or so later. Wannstedt’s Pitt team beat WVU in 2007 to take them out of the BCS title game and put LSU in, extending the SEC’s title streak and recruiting advantage. If WVU had not lost, RichRod wouldn’t have gone to Michigan; Miles would have, and the SEC would probably had a different 4 season without Miles there",nfl
Let's say the bears have another good season and there place lands them the 20th pick in the draft.

You leave out the option that he isn't elite, but pretty good, which let's you sign a pretty good rb for cheap on his fifth year. Either he is dominant for free for five years then you let him go, or it's the situation above, or he's garbage and a waste of a pick. It's a pretty safe pick if you don't need a qb and have a decent OL with good defensive pieces already.",nfl

It's basically a middle ground way to deal with a player still under contract who thinks he's underpaid (very, very correctly, in this case)

Harris doesn't sit out for the season, plays hard, and gets a little extra cash this year

The team shows that it's not going to cave to a shotgun wedding, but also shows everyone else that we're willing to respect that the player is underpaid

Everyone gets something, neither person gets everything they want.  Might be seeing this a little more often, in response to players complaining about their contracts while they still have a year or two left",nfl

"Racism is an ideology. Hence the ""ism"".

If a person uses a racial slur to get under someone's skin, but does so without actually believing that races can be categorized and sorted by value, they're not racist.

Likewise, if a person *never* uses racial slurs, they can still be racist, if they hold to that ideology. 

A laborer engaging in a strike isn't necessary a Marxist. 

A person attending a Catholic church isn't necessarily a Catholic. 

Now you could certainly make the argument that by using those slurs a person who might not himself be a racist is helping to make racism more acceptable, and that to do so is immoral and harmful-- perhaps even more so than being an actual racist who keeps his opinions to himself. 

It doesn't absolve someone of wrongdoing to acknowledge incorrect use of terminology.",nfl

"It's wild that humans never evolved past food or sleep to some extent. Like we (most of us, you don't need to be a special snowflake if you sleep less) should be efficient enough to not need to sleep for a 8 hours a day, a literal third of our lives. Even at 6 hours a day you're actively giving up a quarter of your life. 

Add in work at 9 hours daily (a low estimate) for 70% of the days in your adult life until you retire. The amount of time you spend being you is absurdly low. If you spend 1.5 hours eating/preparing/cleaning after meals a day, that's 16.5 hours a day minimum that you're dedicating to literally just survival. That's a conservative outlook and just about 50% of your adult life is gone.

"&gt; The other team will be forced to respect the run game. Then you can throw all over them.

Generally, defensive alignment is a response to the offensive personnel on the field, not a result of ""respecting the run/pass"".

Unfortunately for Priest Holmes his spot got taken that year by Ricky Williams, who was one of the best RBs in the country immediately, and he never had a shot at being the first-string guy again.",nfl

"Too many comments and too late for mine to get noticed but:

When I'm enjoying a sport and want to follow a team I basically just play process of elimination for as long as objections (no matter how petty) last and then find a personal connection (usually geographic) with the remainders. Off the bat there were 5 teams gone from their names alone:

* ~~**Redskins**~~ - Just nope.
* ~~**Patriots**~~ - Not into the whole US patriotism thing, seems weird.
* ~~**Texans**~~ - Kinda the same, I like Australia so I'm not really gonna go for something so...
* ~~**America's Team**~~ Yeah nah
* ~~**Bengals**~~ - Yeah that's not a thing, there's 1 Bengal, it's a place not a mascot.

Then I knock off the too successful/bandwagon ones:

* ~~**Steelers**~~ - Sucks cos they had Brad Wing at the time and I love the logo, also there was the whole Rothlisberger thing...(I in no way support Hill, just gonna nip that in the bud now)
* ~~**Packers**~~ - Still have a soft spot because of the Aussie colours.
* ~~**Seahawks**~~ - I was getting into the sport in 2013 so when I picked a team in time for the next season the reigning champions were obviously out.

Then some bad (IMO) logos:

* **~~Titans~~** - Literally the worst logo in the NFL, looks so bad and doesn't read as intended at all (nobody has said it's a shield without wearing a Titan flair), flaming thumbtacks and all that, just use the damn sword one.
* **~~Bears~~** - Boring and that damn asymmetry
* **~~Colts~~** also dull
* **~~Browns~~** - Half this and half name, I like having a helmet in the logo (rip Fins) but...not just the helmet.
* **~~49ers~~** - Iffy on the weird name but it was the non-concentric ovals rubbing me the wrong way that killed it, despite me liking letter logos.
* **~~Chargers~~** - Top tier helmet design, poor logo, crucify me but I didn't mind the LA insignia when it was [fixed](https://imgur.com/wIuGwgc) with [literally](https://imgur.com/x78w3Hx) any [existing](https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Chargers-logo-2.jpg) Chargers [branding](https://imgur.com/ZIGTpre).

From there I looked at the ones I liked, and the shortlist came down to:

* **Jets** - Really digged their old uniform and helmet. Liked being the less popular team from NY.
* **Jags, Dolphins, Bucs** - My home state in Australia is basically our Florida, for good and bad. Grew up in a tropical coast city so this felt appropriate.
* **Chiefs** - Kansas City isn't in Kansas? Lol (I know some of it is and tbh the way some fans go crazy over the ""Chiefs are a MO team"" is annoying). Also great helmet and logo.

Then I watched the preseason games and highlights of the last season and chose the Chiefs ~~because they weren't a massive disappointment~~ because I like the tempo-run game and watching defence so when people were calling Alex Smith a ""game manager"" I was wondering why it was treated like an insult. And now I go for a team that's all offence no defence ��",nfl

"They signed Billy Turner who is gonna start at the gaping hole that was Right Guard. Drafted another C/G and a TE, both guys top 5 at their positions in the class. Not too sure what more they could’ve done offensively? Any suggestions? Drafting Aj Brown is the only answer really, but they went OL over him and our biggest flaw on offense last season was OL play and thats what they addressed. Like you said they have Rodgers, so that gives you a little leway in addressing offensive needs. 

On defense, they turned an aging Clay Matthews and injured Nick Perry into Zadarius Smith Preston Smith and Rashan Gary. Thats a wild improvement. Garys an unknown but even if hes on the fuckin field thats already an upgrade to Perry. I think Zadarius and Preston had more combined pressures than our edge group as a whole. Like way more, i don’t have the tweet since it popped up back in march, but it was an absurd amount more. Just an insane improvement. With Clark and Daniels on the interior, thats a very good DLine regardless of how you rank them.

He was regarded as an Eli of the 80s and 90s based on his statistics in comparison to other QBs of that time. The argument was focused on statistics and used a currently controversial QB, in this case Eli, whose two Super Bowl MVP wins have elevated his overall standing amongst current and most recent QBs.

Duke isn't the only team not to have a player drafted since 2016, and when you're not talking about schools like Alabama, Clemson, OSU, etc...  the amount of NFL talent on a team isn't that important or indicative of how good they are because one or two players out of 85 isn't significant.",nfl
"yeah but the reps a backup QB get aren't close to enough and rookies either have to be prepped differently (they split reps with the starter which is why a lot of starters get pissed that the team intentionally lowers their chance of success for a rookie) or go in with ""book knowledge"" and are thrown into the fire. he did well all things considered but BAL wasn't interested in him as a future QB last year, they were just desperate",nfl
"Why though? I mean sure, there offense might not be as electric as last year, but they were very much a flawed team last year as well. They addressed those flaws. They’ve bolstered their defense and (presumably) brought in a much better DC in spags. They’ve become more balanced. 

So sure, technically their offense will probably regress, but there is no reason to think they aren’t going to be one of the best teams this year.",nfl

"&gt; The truth is the away jersey is a staple in all four of the professional sports leagues and has been for quite some time.

Not so much with basketball. The color vs. white thing isn’t as prominent there as it is in football. 

&gt;it’s difficult to rationalize why anyone would want to watch that.

I don’t really care one way or the other, but if I could choose I would definitely prefer watching teams wear their colored jerseys against each other. Maybe not if both teams have dark jerseys, but something like Miami and Seattle would be no different to a color blind person than Miami in their whites vs Seattle.",nfl
"Well to give a bit of context to it all I'm gonna start at the beginning of this all. If you don't care about that you can skip down past all this. 
   
&gt;When the first report came out everyone wanted the Chiefs to cut Hill based the fact that his son had a broken arm, and everyone assumed it was him because of his past. But the Chiefs stood pat because there was still a lot of uncertainty about whether or not it as an accident or intentional, and if it was intentional was it Hill or Crystal?

&gt;Then the initial criminal investigation and DCF investigation weren't able to find out who hurt the child, but the DA said they were ""certain"" someone hurt this child intentionally. Again no certainty as to who did it, and there's speculation that it still could have been an accident and the DA was making a baseless statement. 

&gt;Then the audio tape came out where Crystal was seemingly trying to implicate Hill as the one hurting their child. Hill out of frustration of the accusations told Cyrstal she should be ""terrified"" of him. But again no proof of anything going on. The Chiefs suspended Hill indefinitely until they could figure out exactly what's going on and figure out exactly if Hill is guilty of anything or not beyond a reasonable doubt. 

&gt;A report also came out stating that Cyrstal was found unconscious on the floor when she was supposed to be watching their son. Hill called the police since he was in an apartment away from home (wasn't allowed to see/talk to his son). Apparently Hill has security cameras in his home and saw her unconscious from his security feed. We only know that it was due to a ""medical condition"", it's very vague and could have been anything from a fainting to being knocked out on drugs and alcohol. She lost custody of the child after this incident and is why Hill's son is currently in foster care.
    
Since then rumblings have been trickling out of the Chiefs organization that the front office, coaches, and players believe that Hill is innocent and that Crystal is unstable. There's also supposedly some evidence that supports Hill's innocence, but it's only being shared with police, the Chiefs, and the NFL at the moment. 

So short of Hill getting a serious conviction that lands him in jail, which seems highly unlikely at this point; he's very likely going to be on the Chiefs at least in 2019.",nfl
"Obviously you can get excited and expect to get better because of it but people talk about it like it’s a certainty that the guy they got will be the next great thing before he takes a single snap.

"&gt;If they want Brady throwing slightly less than having big guys who go for contests balls and open up deep on play action is a solid move.

Brady is gonna need to work on that himself.  He's not great at deep ball placement that puts his receivers in great positions to get the ball.  He's either not accurate enough or too conservative and is trying to do the whole, ""I'll put it where my WR *might* be able to get it, but will not put it anywhere a DB could make a strong play on it as well"".   One of Brady's top strengths is ball security and I'd be very surprised if Brady suddenly transformed into a Romo-esque passer throwing up lower % contested catches all the time.

But if he pans out we'll use that pick on someone else.  Either way I'm fine with it.",nfl

On the flip side, you have Goff who was on a cheap contract but his talent crippled his team. Same with Lamar Jackson. You could even argue Watson didn't have the talent to proceed further this year.

Brady isn't a flashy player because he honestly makes it look easy. People will call his arm weak but if you watch his air yards on deep throws he's throwing as far as guys like Rodgers and Mahomes but it's basically effortless for him because he has trained his throwing mechanics to absolute perfection over the years. Look at the way he throws the ball, he has the same exact throwing motion and release time every single throw no matter the speed or distance.",nfl

With swelling and such, that's understandable initially, but apparently they never bothered to look again and instead spent *weeks* treating it like a contusion. 

He was frustrated that he was missing games and not improving from something relatively minor and got a second opinion. The new doctor immediately found out his leg was fractured.

The Saints, to their credit, then fired their orthopedists.

Sidenote: [Poor Breaux can't catch a fucking break on injuries.](https://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/03/16/cornerback-delvin-breaux-patriots-injury-history/) Dude was a high end high school prospect but broke his neck in a pretty horrific way.

He worked his way into the league anyways, but after a season broke his leg and missed a few months, then came back but injured his shoulder.

"Thank you for that post. I support legalization of sex work, but I do not claim that legalizing it ""fixes everything"". No, not at all...and thank you for not suggesting I did.

I support the legalization if it is an agreement between two consenting adults. 

Protecting the rights of adults to enter an agreement like this will have issues, but that's no different than the myriad of legal activities that exist today. Off topic there a bit.

I agree that legalization has issues, but that does not support leaving it illegal. 

I agree that the supply of sex workers will be smaller than the demand, but that does not support leaving it illegal. 

The report (Cho/Dreher/Neumayer) states that there is evidence that legalizing sex work **often increases** rates of human trafficking. Again, legalizing any activity without appropriate legal support and insight will often have negative societal effects...but that does **not** mean it has to be that way.

I fear people will mistake the report's findings as ""legalizing sex work results in increased human trafficking"". That's not what data shows. Data does not make a conclusion like that.

Clearly, I support the legalization of sex work such that it enables adults to willingly enter into sexual service agreements *and* addresses the numerous negative aspects of sex work.

"You have Hurd over Deebo? Hurd was a big slot receiver in college and by all reports still a bit of a project while Deebo should fit right into our system.  

*Maybe* Hurd will turn out to be a better receiver in the future but I don't see how he beats out Deebo for snaps, targets and yards.  I really see Hurd as a redzone threat who can grow into a more complete receiver.

Edit:

Is that because of his injury or what? I see Pettis easily being our leading receiver if he can stay healthy.",nfl

The wrong way is to comment something along the lines of ""these rankers are fucking stupid"" or ""anyone who ranked should be banned"" or ""y'all are fucking morons"". That doesn't lead to constructive responses and just devolves into a shit-slinging match.

The right way, in my opinion, is to shit on the placement of players so that it can be responded to. Defending a ranking =/= getting defensive.

"I don't think he really has a patience problem. i think the situation just makes it seem that way

He took over the team right after his dad fired Mike Nolan. Instead of going on a big coaching search as his first act of business he gave the job to the interim HC Mike Singletary. When that didn't work out he fired him. 

Then came Harbaugh who couldn't get along with the GM and York had to pick sides. He chose the level headed and easier to work with Baalke. That was a mistake. 

The idea then became to try to build the next staff out of coaches from Harbaugh's staff, to try to keep the same system rolling. It was basically another interim hire. If it worked out, great, if not, they could try again. They hired Jim Tomsula instead of Vic Fangio, causing fangio to leave. Another big mistake. They pulled the plug after one year and decided to re-build the team, which was the correct move. 

What he should have done at this point was fire the GM and bring in a new GM/HC combo but instead he stuck with Baalke and we got Chip Kelly. that season was an epic disaster and Jed finally came to his senses and realized Baalke had to go. His choice was then to either let Chip Kelly pick the next GM or to start over. He chose to start over which was the correct decision

So while it seems like he's impatient having fired 3 different coaches after one year, the reality is that two of them were basically interim coaches and all three of those firings were the right move. If anything the biggest criticism of his handling of the situation was that he had been too loyal to Trent Baalke, rather than too impatient with his HCs.",nfl

Other teams, like the Eagles in 2017, have really only just begun copying his free agency strategy 20 years later. The Cowboys have been doing the same for the past few years and their overall success rate is increasing as well. As it becomes more widespread, his competitive advantages will decline.

That skill set though would have been completely worthless pre-1993. That's the point I keep making that people keep arguing with for some reason even though it's self-evident.

"Those are also low-percentage throws. Most teams will air the ball out a few times each game because it (theoretically) forces the safeties to play deep, and if you roll the dice enough on that throw -- it's what, a 35% completion rate on 40-yard passes? -- you take that chance six times, and there's only a 10% chance that you miss all of them. So that's probably a TD.  

But those six chances cost *a lot* of opportunities. Go deep on first down, and now you're behind the chains on second, and you're risking an aggressive pass rush on 3rd followed by a punt. If you only air it out on 2nd-and-very-short (""a pitcher's count"") the defense will start licking their chops and play disguised coverages. Do it on third down and the miss costs you the possession.  

I guess you could do it three times in a row on your first possession of the game... or go deep on first down your first two or three possessions. But you need to really be confident in your 10-yards-to-go play calls.",nfl

He just doesn’t have great volume stats because they didn’t air it out unless they needed to and they usually didn’t need to. When they needed to, he was as good as anyone of his era.

In *nine* years. 


For context, we won 33 games in 3 years with Pagano and Grigson. We were *kinda* shitty with Pagano and Grigson, and it got a bit worse when Luck wasn't there to cover it up with his brilliant play.

But *god damn* we were garbage in the early 80s. Our offense was in the botton 3rd pretty much the whole time, with a couple exceptions. Whereas the defense was ranked around the 20s almost the whole decade, (weirdly they were 1st in '87).

It's no wonder Elway refused to play for us. From what I understand, Robert Irsay was difficult to deal with, and clearly he had no idea how to run a team. Interestingly, as soon as Jim Irsay took over, the Colts have had like 4 losing seasons in 20+ years. (So the apple fell about 30 miles away from the tree)

"He tries to play his Brady hatred as “just trolling pats fans lol so funny I’m in their head!!” But it comes to the point to where he goes on 2 hour twitter sprees where he is tweeting every two minutes about Brady. It’s not trolling at that point. It’s delusional and obsessive. 

His line of reasoning is garbage and if he dropped the Brady “trolling” he’d have such a better twitter page. Yes his Curry bashing isn’t as sever but his Lebron fandom is awful. 

It’s just such a missed opportunity because his tweets are decently funny when he doesn’t let his hatred for Brady/Curry/Patriots/Warriors and his severe fandom of Rodgers/Lebron get in the away. Could be so much better but it’s not.",nfl
"My wife and I had a magnificent Memorial Day Weekend full of productivity, relaxation, good food and some fun times. We acknowledge this was likely our last long weekend before Baby Lakatos joins the world. Hope everyone had a solid long weekend, and to those who worked, I hope you earned time and a half yesterday.

I have a follow-up interview with a company in my industry that I am not too crazy about, but I am going to follow through with it to see whether it sparks any interest and there’s chemistry or a connection with the hiring manager. I also don’t want to outright say no to anyone at this point.

At least it’s a short week. I can’t wait to be far away from this freezing office.",nfl
"I think people in general are way too critical when players yell at each other and get into fights. It reminds of my HS coach; if you haven't gotten into a fight yet, y'all don't care. I can't say for certain, but I doubt players care nearly as much as people make it out to be about players throwing a melty.",nfl
"I get it and that's a good point. That first sack opening night sold me on the AAF to be honest lol.  But when I say ""compete with"" i'm more so referring to going after the same talent pool rather than head to head during the same time of the year. The players coming out will have to make the decision on which league to play in and, unless the XFL can throw more money at them then what's their real reasoning to join them versus a much more established, larger league? The only way I can think of it is either if they offer more money or if their players association is a LOT more aggressive in relations with the XFL that can give them more freedoms they wouldn't get in the NFL.",nfl
"No, it's clearly different for each player

What I'm saying is, lets start with a quarterback being 100% responsible for the win. That's not right, without a good left tackle he's pretty much useless. So lets say the QB is 90% of the win, and tackles are responsible for 10%. Great. It doesn't matter how well the quarterback does if your corners are awful. Lets say, 5% to the corners, now the QB is only worth 85% of the win

I did two positions. Think about a roster",nfl
I’m inclined to agree. I was shocked he didn’t get selected in the 2nd. Perhaps the character concerns (which I find overblown) are why teams passed in the first or second due to the CBA and the amount of guaranteed money that would be required should he be selected in the first or second. A third I believe only the signing bonus is guaranteed so the risk reward imo is fantastic,nfl
"When Vick was on the team everyone would say that they felt bad for him because he had no good receivers. White had 500 receiving yards on 65 targets (46% catch rate) in Vicks pre conviction year. The next year, with Joey Harrington, Roddy White improved to 1200 yards and 60% catch%. I think the downplay of White's career comes from us thinking the WRs were the problem, not Vick.",nfl
"He’s great but to us, his greatness wasn’t worth the contract he would command on the market. He left when McDermott came in, McDermott drafted Tre White and got a slightly worse player for a far cheaper contract. He’s also a DB wizard and can make bad corners look good, so it didn’t make sense to keep Gilmore. Hate the Pats but I love watching him succeed, still believe he should have won Super Bowl MVP.",nfl
"Maybe it won't. But that's why they invented booze. So we can dull the pain of existence, and find some temporary peace. I struggle with it every day. If nothing else, just pack your stuff up and go. That's my plan. Go wander the earth, free of the normal boring life.",nfl
"&gt;!Hey, I'm one of the 48%, neat. I enjoyed last night's episode. Most all this stuff was foreshadowed. Some of the writing has felt rushed and sloppily written at times, but I'm surprised by all the outrage about where we're at. It makes plenty of sense, at least to me.!&lt;",nfl
"I was watching a Thursday night game once. It was the game where Luke Kuechly got a concussion and cried on the field. But aside from that incident, the camera was in super tight close up of Cam's face, basically the entire game. And Cam is a guy who wears his emotions on his sleeve, so you could tell what he was thinking the whole time. It was really fascinating.",nfl
"No wait a second, wait a second...we're talking about **head football coach**. I mean look, if you want to believe so, **then do so**. But I'm not arguing with the Popeye fan *""Yearrrghh we got a great coach and we gonna beat everybody!""* I'm not going to do that. A head coach must have excellent credentials, he must be a proven coordinator, must understand how to run a football team and carry the organization...His success starts this year.",nfl
"We have an office cleaner that runs the dishwasher here. I unloaded the dishwasher and loaded it with the dirty dishes, but no one else has bothered to do it, so I gave up and wash my dishes individually. It's pretty frustrating. 

Yeah I've done the same. It definitely happens. Company-wide, pissed-off emails are always fun.",nfl
"Who the fuck cares about flair and what makes you think I can't ""*handle getting it back*""?

I'm more critical of my hometown team, Kansas City, and it's degenerate fans on Reddit and their own subreddit than any outside fan base can be when it's warranted. That might be one of the lamest posts directed at me that I've ever experienced on Reddit. Congratulations.

For the record, I also don't wear sports jerseys either. My sentiments are the same about flair.",nfl
"Sure, bad coaching and a bad front office can be debilitating. But it takes one hell of a GM to put together a competitive team, when one player alone takes up a huge percentage of the salary cap. I think Saints in particular has done a fantastic job of putting together a great team, given Drew Brees’ contract. It’ll be interesting to see how competitive the Packers and the Seahawks will be in the near future, with the contracts that Rodgers and Wilson got. 

And of course my own team when Brady retires, and we no longer have a QB willing to accept below the market wages.",nfl
"His performance in that Superbowl was incredible.  It gets overshadowed by his absolute dismantling of the eagles secondary in the NFC championship game that year in my opinion.  

It's impossible to hate Larry Fitzgerald but that game made me come close. 


Honorable mention for Superbowl loser performance by a WR, TO in the eagles loss to the pats.  On an unhealed broken leg. 9/0/122. No tds but he tried to put the team on his back.",nfl
"But I mean like what are the exact states in it? I’ve heard/read several different things over the years and have seen places like Ohio included and Ohio is like.... really Far East I feel like. 

Also my phone is just wanting to capitalize Far East every time I type it I guess.",nfl
"The 49ers and Packers may not live up to the expectations a lot of people have for them. Additionally, the Bears are potentially candidates for regression - The Bears had their first excellent season after being bad for a few years so we don't know for sure if they are true contenders or just one year wonders. (Before Bears fans kill me: I am leaning more towards the Bears being true contenders but I would like to see a bigger sample size)

Then like other people have stated, their is always one or more teams that get ravaged by injuries.",nfl
