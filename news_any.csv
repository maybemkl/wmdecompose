"I am on the same page as you concerning the importance of having proper ethical/methodological training, something critically important when working with human remains. In the original post, I was not suggesting that avocational archaeologists are or should be ethical authorities on archaeological practice, but acknowledging that they have different opinions on these topics. Its easy to run into these views if you are interested in archaeology but don't read or interact with many academic/professional archaeologists. I'd be curious to hear your opinion on whether groups of non-professionals (e.g., members of local archaeological/historical societies, site-stewards, museum volunteers, etc.) who often have some degree of training and/or relationship to archaeological institutions can productively and ethically be involved in archaeological research.",news

"&gt; Yet you cite no source.

Weird that you failed at reading comprehension on the link that I gave you. It's the third column if you're wondering.

&gt; 2017 per capita is still higher than 2009.

Woah, this just in, during a recession and mass unemployment, people drive less and thus, crash less. 2007 is a better comparison because it's the year immediately before a recession and seems to fit the trend of the years prior to the recession and following the recovery of the recession.

You're just trying to cherry-pick numbers to make your argument sound more legitimate. The proper numbers to look at is Fatalities per 100 million VMT. In 2007, this was 1.36. In 2009, it was 1.15. In 2016, it was 1.19, and it was 1.16 in 2017. 

Additionally, the per capita rate (Fatalities per 100,000 population)  in 2007 was 13.701, in 2009 it was 11.048, in 2016 it was 11.59 , and in 2017 it was 11.40.

Vehile Miles Traveled (Billions) was 3,031 in 2007, 2,957 in 2009, 3,174 in 2016, and 3,213 in 2017.

Also, your statement ""2016 Was the Deadliest Year on American Roads in Nearly a Decade"" is a really cherry-picked title, because while there were the most deaths over the period of 2008 to 2017 (inclusive) in 2016 (37,806), if you expand that to include 2007 (which I did to be intellectually honest), you'll see that in total vehicular deaths in the USA was 41,259.

"Being transgender in itself is not a mental disorder.


&gt;A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder. For these individuals, the significant problem is finding affordable resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress, including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect experiences with discrimination, or assault. These experiences may lead many transgender people to suffer with anxiety, depression or related disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons.

https://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx

It is common for trans people to experiences extreme stress, anxiety, and depression. But it is wrong to say all transgender people are mentally disordered, no matter how well they are functioning and dealing with the challenges of being transgender.


Some have a lot of dysphoria, others a little. Many after finding support and access to medical care find the dysphoria lessens greatly. Many after they reached their transition goals don't even feel like it's an issue anymore.


The biggest factor is how much distress the dysphoria causes.

A trans person may not be diagnosed with having gender dysphoria if there is not a presence of clinically significant distress. To be clinically significant the symptoms would have to be creating a serious problem in their life. As an example some trans people feel so much dysphoria about their physical body that they can’t shower or they self harm. How you respond to dysphoria is the indicator of mental stability or lack of.

What I do know is that I don't want someone holding my hand or giving me special accommodations because I'm ""disabled"". I can do anything anyone else can if I just put in the effort. It's a damn shame that people like you, who have obviously never tried to understand people with autism or do any research at all, are so quick to make judgements. Personally, I never had special learning accommodations throughout school. As a kid, all I could think about was how embarrassing it would be for me. I knew that other kids would bully me for it. As I grew older, I realized that certain accommodations would've been very beneficial for development, but since I was thrown into the mix with all the normal kids, I adapted and learned how to socialize. I learned how to deal with bullies, I learned how to make friends, and I learned how to talk to people and present myself in such a way that others would assume I'm just a normal guy. I had to, or I'd get left behind. I have worked a lot harder than most people to get where I am today simply because I refused to accept any accommodations. Now, I'm working in a field that I enjoy. I have my dream job, and I love my life. It's all because I truly wanted to be more than what people like you think of me. I wanted to prove all of you wrong, so I did. The people who mean the most to me never gave up on me, so how could I? There were plenty of hurdles to jump over. I'd be a liar if I told you there weren't. But even if I didn't jump over them the first time, I would eventually. Over the years, those hurdles have gotten a lot shorter from my point of view. Every day I improve myself and work to become the best I can be. So no, it's not an excuse. It's a tool I can use to inspire others and myself. I hope one day you understand people like me. If you put in the effort, there's no reason you can't learn about autism and what it actually means to those who live with it every day. ",news

"It is completely feasible if developed nations are willing to finance environmental projects for infrastructure, because these developing countries economies are nowhere near the stage of being able to invest in environmental projects. Country's impact on the environment spikes in their development stages and then drops as they become developed. The US did this, the UK did this, china has developed relatively recently and is working on reducing their environment impact with various environmental projects such as massive wind and solar farms. You can't expect these developing countries to completely halt their current development projects for the good of the environment because they still have people living without power, water, or accessibility to healthcare or education. The only way to reduce their environmental impact at this stage is to provide them support with finances and resources. This does always go over very well in the lending country because that is money they could be spent on their own citizens, and doesn't always go over well in the country being helped because many view it as modern day colonialism.

"You appear to be seriously confused about how the government works. There are essentially two government workforces: the transitory and the permanent.

Transitory government workers are the ones that usually--but not always--come and go with a new administration. This includes cabinet officers and the heads of many government agencies. However, there really aren't that many of them, a few thousand or so.

The permanent workers are the ones who stay on as administrations come and go, and FDA inspectors belong to this group. These are people who stay in government jobs for years, decades. There are some two million of them.

Some of these people represent the *true* expertise of the government, they might well be among the world's foremost experts on their particular field. And one thing that is rarely mentioned is that genuinely bad administrations tend to drive these people out of government service. They get sick of the administration's bullshit and just pack it in. Their replacement probably has WAY less experience, and might even be a political hack. There is a mass expertise drain going on under Trump, as there was under Bush.

And we could talk about edge cases all day long but if mandatory safety training was required to earn a license to own a firearm, and if guns were required to be stored in gun safes, along with other legislation which is common in every other developed country, then the odds of a kid randomly getting a gun in their hands goes way down.

[http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/374816-florida-house-votes-to-declare-porn-a-public-health-risk-within-an-hour](http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/374816-florida-house-votes-to-declare-porn-a-public-health-risk-within-an-hour)

&amp;#x200B;

so they  say they are really trying to shut down trafficking. Sounds great, the  problem is that police departments and other organizations will arrest  sex workers and count them, yes the actual sex workers who are self  employed and there consentually, as people who are trafficked. This  gives them huge numbers to print in the news that says they saved 200  people from being trafficked. Of course the charges don't stick, but  they do charge them with prostitution. The numbers are what people see  though and think they are actually doing something other than harassing  people having sex consentually for money.

Same thing for the no fap groups. It is backed by religious  organizations who want to end all porn. They put up pseudo-science and  make teenagers feel guilty about masturbating and tell them it is the  cause of all their problems.

And anyone else who has done any research on the subject recommends  legalizing prostitution and says it will make everyone involved safer.

When you see people claim to be against trafficking you should look  deeper in to what exactly that entails. It usually just means anti-porn  and anti-sex work of all types.

"&gt;It's not really any less arbitrary than earning citizenship just because both your parents were citizens.

This isn't even remotely true, and I'm pretty sure that you know it. There's nothing arbitrary about it. A nation-state exists to serve, protect, and promote it's specific peoples, their identity, their heritage, and their culture. These are the rightful and legitimate stakeholders in that society - exactly what it means to *be* a citizen (""... to secure the blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity"").

Someone born to an existing citizen of that country ( in the US, only one of your parents has to be an American for this) is literally the physical continuation of that peoples.

Saying that there is no difference between geographic birthright citizenship  (which at the end of the day comes down to happenstance on a particular patch of dirt) and blood birthright citizenship is like saying you don't see the difference between **someone becoming a member of your family, because their mother walked in and gave birth in your living room** VS **someone becoming a member of your family because they are the child of one of your *actual relatives*.** That's insane; there's a very clear, distinct, and meaningful difference there.

Maybe - *maybe* -geographic birthright citizenship made sense when the US was still expanding West, and for the few decades after when it was trying to fill in that territory - but only then, absolutely only for people who were legal residents here. Not illegal aliens. It's also clear from both the wording, and the original surrounding context of the 14th Amendment, as well as the intent of the Founding Fathers in the very beginning, that it was never supposed to apply to people like that. Hopefully, the Supreme Court will soon take up this issue, one way or another, and end this illegal, unconstitutional, and unethical violation of our principles that has been going on for far too long. Now that there are a majority number of actual constitutionalists on the court, I imagine this will happen at the first opportunity when a sufficient case is brought.


&gt;If you ask me all citizenship should have to be earned, not given. If you don't pass the test at 18 you don't get to be a citizen no matter who your parents are. 

Well, I don't necessarily disagree with you here. While I don't think there is any valid basis to remove citizenship from someone who has acquired it through one of the two reasonable ways - being the natural child of a current and legitimate citizen, or going through the full and complete naturalization process in the manner intended by the country's founders - simply because they failed some kind of test, I *definitely* believe that people need to earn the right to meaningfully politically participate in governance (via voting, or whatever other means) by demonstrating a commitment to preserve our legal principles, our cultural and moral values, and our posterity as this country was originally intended. I would certainly support measures to ensure that.",news
"If you really are paying attention to the wall debate, you will realize not all areas of the wall are the same.  San Diego/Tijuana is one of the most active border crossings.  You build walls where they matter, not where they don't.

If there was that kind of massive traffic through the parts of the border that don't have a wall I'd agree with you.  Or if there was a majority of illegal activity occuring because of a lack of some border in those gaps.  But there isn't and there aren't.  It only makes sense if there is a need and there isn't.

Why does CA, or any state, do what they mostly want?  I presume by your stance on the wall you lean conservative adn therefore should know should embrace the greater focus on state rights and less interference by the federal government.  At least that is officially what most conservatives embrace.  What CA wants to do with their money or management is largely up to them.

The truth is, guns serve purposes other than killing people. You can use them for hunting, competition shooting, or even collect antique guns. And yes, some people do keep them for self-defense against common criminals or an organized threat. But above all, I don't want to set a precedent.

And barring all of that it's even easier to drive a truck through a crowd. We've never seen a shooting as devastating as the truck attack in Nice. Not even Vegas, which was very carefully planned out was as bad as the truck attack. No one is trying to ban cars because we have a basic right to own a car. We need to look at guns the same way.

Why not have a policy allowing orderly, [merit based immigration like Canada](https://workpermit.com/immigration/canada/canada-federal-skilled-worker-program) and many other countries? There is no country in the world that treats people illegally crossing its borders as legitimate migrants and faces so much criticism for even weakly trying to enforce it's immigration laws.

"The biggest contributor to US debt is the benefits of financing. We can leverage more value for our nation by betting on our economy to get better over time. And on the long term this bet always pays off. 

Endless financing makes no sense for a singular person because in the long run a singular person will eventually fail productively. They will get old, feeble, and die.

This isn't true of nations. Nations have a self replenishing workforce, and one that gets progressively more effective through technology. This is a situation where endless financing is actually beneficial. 

If you had $100,000 and had an offer to pay $100,000 cash for a house or take a $100,000 loan for it at a 1% annual rate what would you do? An idiot would pony up the cash. A smart person would take the loan and invest their money earning 5% a year on it as they pay off the loan. America does the second version in a slightly more complicated way

Then the article goes on to offer more recent definition created by anti-gun lawmakers.

So, the article used misleading information to try and convince the reader that the newest definition is the correct one.

A bunch of my foreign co-workers had made big mistakes about bars  when they first arrived in Japan. They just assumed that any bar is the same as back in their home countries. They ended up trying to enter bars that associated with yakuza or seedy (by Japanese standards) activities. They didn't get why they weren't allowed in. One time, they managed to just walk into one, and the person behind the counter had to call in the manager to find out what to do. A tough looking guy in a suit came in and said they can stay and have a couple drinks (probably because it was a slow night). But my co-workers realized that it wasn't the kind of bar that they expected. They ended up paying a pretty big bill. (not because they are foreign, but because that kind of place charges a lot of money to customers).

 They didn't know the difference between the different types of bars in Japan. Here's a guide FYI: [https://www.nomunication.jp/types-of-bars-in-japan/](https://www.nomunication.jp/types-of-bars-in-japan/)",news

We should mock and discourage those ideas, counter them with logical and reasonable ideas.

"Gender dysphoria isn't synonymous with transgender.


Being transgender in itself is not a mental disorder.


&gt;A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder. For these individuals, the significant problem is finding affordable resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress, including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect experiences with discrimination, or assault. These experiences may lead many transgender people to suffer with anxiety, depression or related disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons.

https://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx

It is common for trans people to experiences extreme stress, anxiety, and depression. But it is wrong to say all transgender people are mentally disordered, no matter how well they are functioning and dealing with the challenges of being transgender.


Some have a lot of dysphoria, others a little. Many after finding support and access to medical care find the dysphoria lessens greatly. Many after they reached their transition goals don't even feel like it's an issue anymore.


The biggest factor is how much distress the dysphoria causes.

A trans person may not be diagnosed with having gender dysphoria if there is not a presence of clinically significant distress. To be clinically significant the symptoms would have to be creating a serious problem in their life. As an example some trans people feel so much dysphoria about their physical body that they can’t shower or they self harm. How you respond to dysphoria is the indicator of mental stability or lack of.

Goals which are often the elimination of the nation state.

 Though its worth mentioning that american antifascists are pretty tame, which makes sense as america isnt very fascist, obviously in countries that are more fascistic and/or experiencing military conflict antifa members can get pretty intense doing things like assasinations and kidnappings, to having their own group within the sdf forces fighting isis or other oppressive regimes in the region.

"&gt; The use of air strikes, and economic sanctions begs to differ. Countries use the hell out of those and they definitely hit civilians the hardest.

Targeting is different from impacting. Nominally, the mission should be to destroy some military or government target and any civilians killed are unfortunate collateral damage. It's the difference between blowing up a civilian book shop because it was next door to a military armory (armory was targetted, book store was collateral) and bombing a cancer research facility (no military value or targets). As for economic sanctions, those are also supposed to be targetted at governments not countries. If China caved to the US' demands or had a non-hostile coup, then the sanctions should evaporate.

&gt; Of course the countries are using them against enemies that don’t have the Air Force or economic pull to retaliate in the same way.

War crimes aren't there to enforce parity, otherwise nobody would agree to them. They're there to stop things like unmarked minefields making huge swaths of land unusable for decades after the conflict, creating a generation of cripples to sap the economy well after their government collapsed, or destroying vital non-combat infrastructure.",news
"&gt; I think you're wrong. Victims of mass shootings, of which there have been many, would very likely be alive if those had been stabbings instead.

I think you are missing the point. The mass shootings could not happen at all - not be exchanged for stabbings - and the impact of violent crime would be insignificant. 

&gt; Suicide by gun is often fatal, but suicide by knife (or most other means) has a higher survivability rate, largely because they often take longer so there's more of a chance someone will find the suicidal person before they expire.

Suicide is a non-starter. Americans are not going endure an infringement on their rights to make it slightly more difficult for people who want to kill themselves to kill themselves. 

&gt; You're the one saying bringing a knife to a gun fight is statistically the same

I haven't said or insinuated anything of the sort.

&gt; Even if both numbers make up only small portion of overall violent crime, guns are far more deadly, more often, than knives. If you can't accept the basic facts of the situation than we can't have a meaningful discussion about it.

"&gt;Two regular people aren't going to testify in their own criminal cases because they don't have to, especially if they know there's video evidence that contraverts their version of events.

Thats irrelevant. They have already put things on official documents that appear to not be the truth based on video evidence of that event. They don't need to testify in the actual trial for that to be admitted. 

&gt;It's entirely possible to have two different, even contradictory accounts of the same event. 

No one said it wasn't. A truism with zero context adds nothing to the discussion. 

&gt; I won't dispute that there are police officers out there who lie on official reports to cover for buddies, or that cops receive favorable treatment in the courts. 

Again, clearly true. 

&gt;After reviewing the evidence available to me. I'm not sure I would have come to the same conclusion that the judge did, but I don't have all of the evidence.

So despite what you actually believe the evidence to show you choose to think this was a just decision? That's a fine opinion to have, I disagree. 

Your point appears to be to take the judge's word for it despite evidence to the contrary because there may be some unknown to us fact that she decided to not mention in her decision.  The history of the criminal justice system generally and in cases like these specifically (not to mention the fact that the judges comments appear to intentionally try to repudiate findings from the original jury) doesn't allow me to do so.

It was a model of intermodal public transit, allowing people to commute both within their immediate areas and to other more distant neighborhoods within the metro area. 

Secondly, people don’t *want* to spend their entire day in traffic. They don’t want smog, or pollution, or drunk drivers, or the huge wastes of space and real estate chokes that parking requirements bring. They don’t want global climate change and pollution to get worse and worse, and they don’t want monthly payments on a giant hunk of metal and fiberglass. Cars represent a tragedy of the commons, whereby people want individual convenience and as a result of them ALL getting that convenience, everyone’s lives are worse.

2: Included depreciation income which, of course, could not actually be spent as cash.

https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/aal/financials?query=income-statement

Operating expenses annually is about 27 billion. Debt servicing is another billion annually.

https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/aal/financials?query=balance-sheet

They have a paltry 612 *million* in cash and cash equivalents. In other words... enough for about 7.8 days of expenses. And even if they do manage to go seven days they'll have serious problems restarting operations afterward without their cash reserve. So that shortens it by even more.

Also your numbers are inflated for a variety of reasons. Aired cargo may be high dollar value but it's not high physical or weight volume. It could go over the road. It would take longer, but it would get there. So you're not losing out on 100% of the value. And again, people could take the train places. Again, it would take longer but saying you'd lose 100% of the value is an inflated estimate.

&gt;Now, Mr. Trump’s fixation with a border wall — the material embodiment of his keep-them-out immigration agenda — has run headlong into the new realities of divided government, pitting him against Democrats who reject the idea out of hand. The impasse is particularly remarkable given that even some immigration hard-liners do not regard the wall as their highest priority and fear that Mr. Trump’s preoccupation with it will prompt him to cut a deal that trades a relatively ineffectual measure for major concessions on immigration.

&gt;...

&gt;Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump’s acting chief of staff, gave voice to that position in 2015, when he was a congressman from South Carolina, telling a local radio station that Mr. Trump, at the time a presidential candidate, had an overly simplistic view of tackling immigration.

&gt;“The fence is an easy thing to sell politically,” Mr. Mulvaney said then. “It’s an easy thing for someone who doesn’t follow the issue very closely to say, ‘Oh, well, that will just solve everything, build the fence.’ The fence doesn’t solve the problem.”

"Sorry for the copy-paste, but I am seeing so many responses to this post with truly abysmal attempts at statistical analysis that I simply have to respond. Please do respond with any questions you have - I'll follow-up as soon as I can.

Let's start by laying out our knowns.

According to the article:

* 21% of searches led to arrest for white people
* 16% of searches led to arrest for black people
* 1.08% of whites encountered were stopped
* 5.02% of blacks encountered were stopped

According to the 2011 census, in London:

* 59.8% of the population is white
* 13.3% of the population is black

So let's start off with a population of 10,000 to make the numbers easy to work with:

Race:|White| Black|Total
:--|:--|:--|:--
Arrested|13.563|10.682|24.245
Not Arrested|51.021|56.083|107.104
Searched|64.584|66.766|131.350
Encountered|5980|1330|10,000

A lot of those numbers look pretty similar, don't they? Only two more searches out of ten thousand are for black people, after all. Seems fairly promising for stop-and-frisk to start with.

But in the interest of completeness, let's not forget the next step of normalizing the data to the same scales:

Race:| White| Black|Total
:--|:--|:--|:--
Arrested    | 22.68| 25.20| 47.88
Not Arrested| 85.32|476.80|562.12
Searched    |   108|   502|   610
Encountered |10,000|10,000|20,000

Ah. That's a bit of a different story, isn't it?

Giving the police the maximum benefit of the doubt, it seems black people are just as likely as white people to need arresting. Yet they are five times more likely to be searched! That is... not good.

Even if you didn't care about the civil rights angle of all this, it's just plain *inefficient*.

This sort of statistics problem is [well-modeled, such as in the medical field](https://brownmath.com/stat/falsepos.htm). It's why doctors will schedule follow-up tests to confirm earlier ones. Even a positive

"Very well said. I agree completely. 

It's funny though. I'm in my late 30's. I grew up in central fla, not poor but not well off. We did fine, had what we needed. Lived in a very mixed neighborhood. Went to a school in downtown Orlando that, at the time, was 80%+ black (I'm also a white male). Then moved onto college where the demographics were much more light colored. I have to say, it seems we were far less racist than than we are now. Or to put it better: there was far less tension and distrust.

But like you said, it's still a bubble. I like to think I experienced it from both sides, but the area I lived in is just far more progressive I guess, and racism just would not be tolersted at all. I don't know what people from other areas have experienced and what they go through. Another state might as well be another country in many respects. 

Privilege is irrelevant to racism. I think it's very important to remember that. There are plenty of people of all races and nationalities that struggle every day to get by, that experience hatred and bigotry whatever the color if their skin or their accent. The color of their skin doesn't make that easier. Tell a poor white person that can't find full time work and wouldn't be able to feed their family even when they do because they only make minimum wage that they have an innate privilege over someone of a different color who is doing better and see how they respond. Privilege is about class, not race or gender. 

Companies that allow this should definitely be neckstomped HARD for the way they treat people. I'm sure this ant not the only one, although I would have said it maybe hard to believe in 2018. But I think it's time to stop the rhetoric about racial ""privilege"" and fight racism and bigotry when we see it. Things like this are able to be swept under the rug and continue for so long because it's being drowned out by all the fake outrage over privilege and unconscious bias and micro aggressions and pronouns etc. Crying wolf with racism when there is none let's things like what was happening at that plant go unnoticed for so long because of all the other noise. I would be willing to bet the executives at GM thiught the same thing: no way this is widespread, and certainly management would take action if it were. When someone complains, it's just another over sensitive guy getting all worked up over an untasteful joke or something, and it gets ignored. I do believe that's what was going on here, and I'm sure it happens elsewhere as well. When I said the UAW was corrupt, I didn't mean just racially, I meant in just about every way, which is what allowed this behavior to start and continue in the first place. The UAW is more at fault than GM by protecting these guys, and GM was just complacent (IMO). But what do I know. I only have my own experience to draw from, just like everyone else. ",news

"It's alright dude, I may have also come out the gate a tad strong there. Sorry about your pain btw. I need to clarify that I don't think using opiates necessarily makes you an addict, same as any potential addictive drug. I was on percocet for a week after my surgery (I had a month's supply and could have gone longer, but I always react really poorly to opiates. Percocet was surprisingly less severe than my previous experience when I got my wisdom teeth out, but still, terrible nausea and complete disorientation. Literally couldn't sleep, and try vomiting in a sling with no coordination when every time your shoulder moves at all is excruciatingly painful. Not fun.) Lots of icing, some ibeprophin, and Tylenol was much more tolerable for me, even with the pain. What I was trying to say is that prolonged use tends to lead to a tolerance building up, steadily increasing dosages, and addiction. Not universally of course, but often enough that it doesn't make sense to continue doing that with new patients. The numbers don't lie, that's where an absurd portion of today's addicts got started.

If you are on a steady dose and that works for you, I applaud that. I think it's cruel to cut off people who have already been using it for a chronic condition if they are stable and it works for them, and I understand that this is absolutely a thing that happens now due to the new guidelines, and that is messed up. Even with a tolerance there is still an effect, and that may be good enough for some people. However, it isn't for others. The problem is that way too many people can't handle this, and you never know which group you fall into until it's too late. That's why the guidelines were changed. 

Now, with regards to corrupt doctors, I think you misinterpreted what I was saying, since you seem to be disagreeing with me by agreeing with exactly what I said. Doctors can easily be corrupted by potential money from perscriptions, which would discourage them from pushing for tighter guidelines. The push for these restrictions stems from the political pressure addicts' families are putting on politicians to do something (really, anything, even if it was misguided) about this crisis. Now, cutting off the supply of perscription pills only led to heroin and Fentanyl becoming major problems, but I think that was mostly due to the focus on punishment over getting people who had become dependent on these pills without having chronic pain conditions into treatment centers (and maintaining decent standards of treatment, as many rehabs are just scams). Some individuals with chronic pain conditions who were on stable doses also got caught up in that, but for the most part the individuals who switched to harder drugs were being supplied either directly or indirectly by pill mills. Again though, this push to cut perscriptions is from political pressure, not corruption. 

To summarize, what I'm saying is that the evidence strongly supports that the risk of addiction and loss of effectiveness due to tolerance far outweighs the potential benefits of using opiates to treat chronic pain conditions. Therefore, going forward it makes little sense to give these drugs to new patients for anything other than acute pain, terminal illness, or short-term post-operative issues, hence the change in treatment guidelines. Some people can handle it and it is stupid to cut off individuals who are clearly fine, but that needs to be handled on a case-by-case basis. The general guideline of avoiding opioids for chronic pain is a sound and reasonable one that we had maintained prior to the 90's and only changed in the first place due to pressure from drug companies. That being said, we really ought to be doing more research into potential alternatives for patients with long-term or intractable chronic pain, as it is unconscionable to just allow them to suffer.",news

"&gt; Why not? Everyone else does.

My whole original comment was about how that isn't logical and I called it out because we shouldn't do that. If we did that, no forward progress would be made into more egalitarian societies. 


&gt;Do you give up tying your shoelaces because no one has commissioned a multi-variable controlled test with n&gt;1000 of whether the bow knot is actually the optimal knot for tying shoes? New hiring managers are trained and start careers every day, and they track metrics of hiring, firing, and performance to make sure that their results are up to standards. Do you not eat food without ensuring that it is the best food according to academic journals? You're making this much more abstract than it actually is.

That's such an exaggeration. My whole point is just that because one study found one small thing about the hiring process, doesn't mean that we should assume it's because one gender is not as as good as another in terms of actual job performance. Just because some studies found that men were not likely to be the stay at home parent, doesn't mean we should assume it's because they aren't as qualified to be parents. It's the same logic applied to both situations. If men aren't as likely to be parents, we should investigate why, not assume we know the reasoning. We are doing that research now and find that there is bias in the court system, a lack of men requesting custody, and societal pressures that drive men to choose to be the financial provider. Now we are doing similar research in hiring practices for women and find that women are not as likely to be hired. Further studies need to determine why that happens, because, like with men as parents, it's probably multifactorial. We can't assume that because men aren't as often the primary caregiver that they aren't good at it, just like we can't assume because women are less likely to be hired that they aren't good at it. It's illogical and the person I originally replied to stated that their unfounded, invalid conclusion was ""logical"". ",news

The Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests – or SNAP – said it doesn't keep count of sexual abuse allegations, but CBS News' Nikki Battiste has spoken with several women who recently reported misconduct, ranging from forceful kissing to molestation, all carried out by nuns.

"&gt;We have no moral duty to put those weapons back on the market.  I know you're trying to say we should treat them as equivalent to other forms of merchandise, but that's completely wrongheaded.  
&gt;  
&gt;Firearms aren't houses, cars, or clothing.  They are weapons.  They are designed as weapons.  They are manufactured as weapons.  They are used as weapons.

The ""purpose"" argument is not falsifiable. Meaning is assigned to objects, not inherent to them.

Also, let me counter: if a house has a sound proofed room to better enable sexual assault, can we then bulldoze it? After all, it was custom designed specifically for crime, which puts it above pretty much all firearms in that regard.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Destroying them is in line with the overall goal of weapon nonproliferation. 

Weapon nonproliferation is not a legitimate domestic goal. Keeping them out of the hands of criminals and psychos (not a technical term) is a better framing, but we already have systems in place to do that, and more broadly, we want to monitor and reform/disable those sorts of people regardless of firearms availability.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Military units regularly destroy surplus  weapons or captured weapons, because it's strategically a bad idea to  leave such things in circulation.  Law Enforcement would be wise to do  the same

Two things:

1. This is 99% logistics. The chance of an enemy weapon being well maintained, having adequate backup parts, and using the same ammo is basically zero, so it's not that we don't want to recycle, it's we can't. Shipping them home has a similar issue, as the volume, weight, and paperwork present a real challenge when planes are limited and have to worry about surface-to-air missile attacks that doesn't exist domestically.
2. The other portion is the threat is magnitudes of order worse. Not only are there vastly more bad guys, but vastly worse bad guys. Any US city that is close to as bad as Fallujah at its peak should be forcibly evacuated because it cannot be saved by more limited means.",news
"&gt;Why would it spook foreign foreign investors? The US has seized Iranian assets before and no one panicked.

It's going to become a military intervention soon.

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cia-venezuela-crisis-government-mike-pompeo-helping-install-new-remarks-a7859771.html

This is the standard operating procedure that the US has used again and again to overthrow governments. First comes the manifactured media narrative, then the clandestine operations, then the sanctions, and then finally the right excuse comes along and the US and it's allies launch a military intervention.

&gt;the US literally invaded Iraq, yet today, 80% of Iraqi oil is extracted &amp; sold by non-US (mostly Chinese and Indian) companies, while out of the oil US companies do extract and sell, these companies still have to pay large licensing fees to the Iraqi government - a far cry from just seizing the oil fields/state owned company, selling the oil, and keeping the profits like you claim the US wants to do in Venezuela

The US literally tried to get the Iraqi parlaiment to pass an oil law that would give no-bid contracts to US oil companies.

"So it has been brought to my attention that my tone was quite condescending - and after review unfortunately thats true. I apologize, I didnt mean to condescend. 

That being said, and I know you probably dont want to hear it, I still need to point out this falsity: it's not that guns are dangerous, as you took away from my last post. But it is that they make a possible home invasion more dangerous. You are more likely to get injured or killed during an armed home invasion if you own a gun as supposed to not owning one. 

Lets say, god forbid, your home is invaded - as soon as you draw a gun you escalate the situation, leaving the perpetrator no choice but to escalate themselves. Shots are fired, people get injured. Can you be so sure that you will be the only one with straight aim? Even without the intend to shoot to kill both from you and the perpetrator, how sure can you be that a stray bullet doesn't hit one of your family members?

I dont live anywhere dangerous, so to me talk is cheap. I cannot imagine not feeling safe in my home. That being said, I think in such a situation I'd turn to other solutions before adding an other risk factor to my home. Equip my house with obvious cameras and a security system. Organize a a neighborhood watch and coordinate lookouts with neighbors.

As to competitions - believe it or not, I like to shoot as well. But where I learned shooting you are not allowed to take the gun home  - instead it is locked and safe at the gun range (by law). You can still follow this hobby without having a gun on you all the time.",news

"First, I’m not saying your wrong in any of your assertions.  I want to say this though.

My cat is an indoor/outdoor cat.  We have a contract that involves me allowing him to roam when he feels fit and the weather is appropriate.  He is fixed and vaccinated up to date.  He has his claws for self-defence, and is a fantastic mouser who occasionally gets overzealous and takes out birds, squirrels, and the odd household bunny.  He has even been found to control the other cats in the neighbourhood that were a pain in the ass prior to him showing up.  

Sounds too good to be true, but it gets better.  His name is George.  He is good company and the neighbours enjoy his visits.  They leave some treats for him now and then and will sit with him on their deck for company.

George is scared shitless of vehicles and bolts before you even know one is coming half the time.  He is currently 8 years old and gets checkups once a year to make sure he’s still healthy and strong.  So far so good.

Some cats owners are awful.  I have seen indoor cats miss-treated by otherwise well intentioned people and watched while litters have been removed from a neighbours place by animal control.  Having a cat the spends time outside is no more evil or abhorrent than having a cat restricted to an apartment.  It’s all in how you treat the cat you have and if your a responsible owner to start with.  

Most people are entrenched in their opinions.  I’m not asking you to give up your position on indoor versus outdoor, just evaluate my message about absolutes being a falsehood.  No one way is best.  It depends on conditions, the owners, and the cat in questions.

"&gt;The disgrace is in realizing they must adapt and calling for it while also omitting empathy, accountability, and general acknowledgment of the failures of America as a whole that have led us to the point where relatively immediate job retraining and relocation is required for so many people.

I have empathy, but I also have context and experience.

I grew up in an area where the coal industry employed 60% of the workforce. There have been many, many attempts to transition the industry to something more modern. There were many programs to help them diversify their skills.

When election time comes, what do you think they do?

They demonized Democrats, saying that they were trying to destroy the town. They fought against any politician that supported any attempt to modernize the plants, or to reduce pollution. 

Now, some of that could be explained as plant owners coercing their employees to argue in favor of increasing profits, even though the employees didn't have any profit sharing programs. But, mostly it comes down to the people seeing the future, seeing the offers for change, the programs to try and move forward, but refusing and fighting against the people trying to help them because they really just don't want to change.

So, I can have some empathy, but you also need to realize that a lot of these coal workers are actively refusing to change, They're being told that they need to change. They've been told for decades. They've been offered help and options and ways out. And for the most part, they've opposed everyone offering them.

Why are they not accountable? Why aren't the failures mostly theirs?

I hear the term ""we"" used a lot in reference to decisions made by government. I think that is never accurate. Many of these decisions were made without public input except through representative democracy. Some of them we actually voted on. So ""we"" means ""the government"" or ""the majority"" respectively. It doesn't mean me, I sure didnt vote for that or even the representative (or appointee) who did decide it. From that basis, people would argue that democracy=freedom. But, even the tyranny of the majority is a tyranny for everyone else. That's why I think having the absolute minimum restrictions necessary for safety (NAP) is the closest we can come to justice in this unjust world. I'll take the lumps and responsibilities that come with that if it means I can be free from tyranny. It's worth it to me, and if it isnt for you, you are welcome to create whatever society you'd like. I really don't care what you do until you step on my freedoms or those of anyone else. ",news

"Yes. There was no standard system for training lawyers. All you needed to do was pass the bar and then you had all the perks of being a lawyer.

So the quality of lawyers varied massively. For a long time it was a Wild West in the US regarding what lawyers should do.

The UK and most of Europe were similar, but were more rigorous requiring appointment and usually had a split profession. If you wanted to be a lawyer in 18th century England, you had a choice between three different jurisdictions and you could only be a lawyer within your chosen jurisdiction. Unless you were part of two different more senior bars that had cross jurisdiction powers.

Some of this rubbed off on the US. Such as having separate bars for each state, the federal courts, and SCOTUS. These days Commonwealth countries still have split barristers and solicitors too. Meaning solicitors do the research and advice, while barristers stand in court. 

All this said, I'm sure Lincoln was a great lawyer and didn't just bully his opponents. ",news

"Absolutely. People in general are "" too fucking stupid to take care of their own health"". Every industry is too stupid to take care of their own health. This has been proven constantly. Without regulation business always take too many risks. People regularly die from curable and treatable diseases. Pretending this doesn't happen just makes the issue more prevalent as less caution is applied.  

Voluntary 2/month tests. Even the industry wants to more regulation ""AIDS Healthcare Foundation has been trying to force the industry to adopt condom use for years. ""

""“people who exchange sex for money or nonmonetary items” (hereinafter referred to as “people who exchange sex”) includes a broad range of persons who trade sex for income or other items including food, drugs, medicine, and shelter. Persons who exchange sex are at increased risk of getting or transmitting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) because they are more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviors (e.g., sex without a condom, sex with multiple partners) and substance use. ""  
https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/sexworkers.html    

"". Many people who exchange sex for money or goods do not self-identify as sex workers12, and do not seek nor have access to HIV prevention, treatment""

Sex workers do not on average take better care of their bodies, that's entirely false. Maybe you do. Don't take this as an attack on you. But most don't.  17% of sex workers on average in the USA have HIV compared to 0.0061% of the non-sex working population. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23931126    

This study found that 9.8% of black female sex workers in New York who had previously been tested not to have the HIV virus got it within 12 months. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23931126

Try not to feel like I'm attacking you, I am attacking your profession sure, but that's not you, you shouldn't attach yourself to your work so much. I agree that sex work is primarily dangerous for the sex worker. But for you to suggest there is no danger to the customer is a flat out lie. For sex work to succeed as a legitimate industry there have to be substantial enough protections for both sex workers and customers that there is no statistically measurable possibility of injury. That would be good for you too. Not being able to advertise in shady ways might lose you customers now, but those customers aren't gone, you just need to fall in line with improving industry standards to improve industry quality.

"&gt;But there are customizable solutions for deployments that might meet those circumstances. We literally have the technology and its inexpensive to administer long lasting implants in place of daily pills or weekly injections. That being said, I'm not seeing the lack of infrastructure that precludes troops from serving in the middle of a desert from currently receiving stockpiled meds in the local infirmary that already exists and is run by medical staff.

I never said it wasn't possible. I simply said that we should make the same effort to accommodate trans people that we do diabetics or other chronic conditions. If we are, in fact, making accommodations for other groups, then by all means, I'm down for those measures. 

&gt;This argument is reaching, especially by today's standards and as I was saying earlier, not having access to ones HRT regiment for days, weeks, even months isn't going to make a stable trans person unstable. Tell them they will never have access to those meds again and that's now the policy and yeah, that more likely to do it.

How is it ""reaching"" to believe trans should be treated equally to cis? Again, I never said anything about trans people being unstable without hrt. You created that argument, I don't get why you keep bringing it up. I'm simply saying that they should have equal health care as cis soldiers. 

&gt;Surely at some point you realize this argument doesn't fit the current reality as I described previously. If diabetics could(and maybe they can. I don't know) get a biannual implant, would you still see a ban as justifiable?

Okay what ban do you think I find justifiable? I've already stated many times that I don't agree with a trans ban. My only concern whatsoever is the availability of meds to soldiers in combat. If there is an implant that can solve this issue, for both trans and diabetics, I'm all for it. 

Also I feel like you're making my personal opinions on this a bigger factor than they are. I'm literally just saying that *the military's* policy on chronic medication in the field should apply equally to trans and cis soldiers. That's it. I'm not trying to argue about whether those policies are correct. I'm simply saying that being trans should not make you subject to rules that other soldiers aren't, but that it shouldn't get you special accommodation either. I'm literally just saying that trans people should be treated equally. 

&gt;&gt;Nothing else matters as far as that comparison. Substitute any condition that requires consistent medication and the argument is the same. 
&gt;
&gt;Well, I think I've addressed this and I don't want to antagonize or be too repetitive.

Please, address it. The comparison was literally only about the need for constant medication, you're looking into it too much if you take it in any other way. 

&gt;It should matter if the actual problem threatens the life of the individual or their ability to serve. I see the limited scope of your base argument but aren't you making the wrong argument with incomplete defined standards?

If it matters to the military then it matters. You're making my arguments more complicated than they're meant to be and not seeing my arguments at face value. When I said it doesn't matter whether if it's life threatening or not, what I meant was that the only part of my comparison that mattered was the chronic condition part. But you're right, it does matter because the military would probably handle it differently depending on that. At the end of the day, again, I'm simply saying that what matters is that trans and cis people's medical needs be looked at using the same standards. 


&gt;&gt; All I'm saying is, I don't think it's realistic for trans people to expect to be able to receive hormones while on active duty, **IF** other soldiers with chronic conditions don't also get their medications. If diabetic soldiers can still get insulin while on active duty, then people that need hormones should be able to get them as well. If those resources aren't available to diabetics or etc, I don't think trans people have a right to those accommodations. Which is where the going off hormones comes into play. 


&gt;That's what I'm getting at. They do. Even in this thread you see mentions of people noting they served with diabetic troops. 

Okay, cool, that should be the end of this argument. If diabetics get accommodations while they're in the field then trans people absolutely should too. Full stop. That was my only point here whatsoever so if that's settled then I don't see the issue anymore. 


&gt;I do. It just doesn't make sense. If they are stable enough to serve without treatment such as HRT, then why bother mandating they circumvent treatment in order to serve? 

This doesn't make sense. ""If they're stable enough to serve without HRT, then why say they can't do HRT?"" Like not being rude but that sentence makes no sense to me. It's like saying ""If diabetics need insulin to serve, why bother giving them insulin?"" Also once again, stability was not a concern of mine, that was all you. 

&gt; What problem does that even solve?

It solves the problem of availability of hormones in the field, which is the only issue I had. 

&gt; By delaying their treatment and making them choose, aren't you affecting their futures in a negative way that might actually traumatize them and affect their quality of life as they get older? 

That's ridiculous, you're saying that they'd be traumatized by not being able to join the army? 

&gt;As a trans person, I see this argument as a way to control when a trans person should be allowed to transition or forcing them into making transition a choice  against a career.

I'm not persecuting you, that's a very dramatic interpretation of my arguments. 

&gt; Why can't they have both, especially if they are enlistable when their mental stability isn't dependent on their availability of medicine?

The same reason I can't be in the air force because of my bad vision: life isn't always fair. And also, maybe they can, I never said they couldn't. You're making this way too much about what trans people deserve when I'm literally just saying they should be equal. 


Look. Forget everything I've said before. Don't read into this, take everything I'm saying at face value. Don't assume anything about my positions.

I DON'T SUPPORT A BLANKET BAN OF ANY KIND.

I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT TRANS PEOPLES EMOTIONAL STABILITY IS BASED ON THEIR HRT SCHEDULE.

I SIMPLY THINK THAT **IF** CIS SOLDIERS CAN'T BE ACTIVE DUTY OR ENLIST DUE TO NOT BEING ABLE TO GET MEDS WHILE DEPLOYED, THE SAME SHOULD BE TRUE FOR TRANS SOLDIERS.

AND **IF** CIS SOLDIERS GET ACCOMMODATIONS FOR CHRONIC CONDITIONS, TRANS PEOPLE SHOULD TOO.

Like I'm literally just saying trans soldiers should have the same opportunities and nothing more that cis soldiers have. I'm not saying or implying anything else. Do have an issue with any of those arguments? Because if not then the rest of this was entirely unnecessary.

If it's possible under the existing infrastructure for trans people to get HRT while deployed, and other chronic conditions are also accommodated for, than I have no issue whatsoever with trans people serving. I'm not talking about how the policies should be. I'm just saying all policies should apply to everyone equally. That's it.",news

"&gt; The average Chinese making $30,000 a year pollutes WAY more than the average USAian making $30,000 a year.

Well first of all that's a false equivalency, because obviously $30,000 in China is a significantly higher purchasing power than the American making that amount, just the same way that a person making 30,000 pounds in the US is significantly more than making the same in the UK. If you want to compare, then you should compare on equivalent purchasing power and see how emissions stack. Alternatively you could normalize emissions per person based on country GDP to compare relative emissions per industrial capacity.

Second of all, I'd love to see your source for the claim that the Chinese person of equivalent purchasing power pollutes more than an American of equivalence. 

Finally, if you were to track the emissions for the production of a commodity and track where that commodity ended up, you would see a great deal of those emissions produced by China are actually a result of US demand. In other words, the purchase of a product by an American contributes more to the CO2 production of China than vice versa. ",news

"As far as firearms go, I’d recommend the following on YouTube:

[Forgotten Weapons.](https://www.youtube.com/user/ForgottenWeapons) Entirely apolitical, focused on weird, old, and unusual firearms. Ian goes fairly in depth on the history and function of the firearms. He just put out a state of the channel video for 2019 that will give you a good run down on what to expect on the channel. Be warned, it is a literal rabbit hole. 

[Hickok45](https://www.youtube.com/user/hickok45). The grandfather you never knew you wanted. No nonsense fun with a bit of information and background. Slightly political, he does encourage you to join the NRA at the end of his videos. Not pushy, but if that’s something you’re worried about do know he mentions it. 

[CandRsenal](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClq1dvO44aNovUUy0SiSDOQ). The rabbit hole of rabbit holes. Very intense history on small arms of WWI. You can easily see what you’re looking at, but it’s easily a minimum of 40 minutes just to explain how this particular revolver came to exist. Excellent if you’re interested in 1870s-1918 history. Also entirely apolitical. 

[InRangeTV.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeUNM9NqJqZXfRNeuW4_2sg) One of my favorites. Fairly practical, they’re known for their mud tests as well as practical analysis. Ian from ForgottenWeapons shows up fairly frequently. It does get political at times but it’s fairly easy to see it coming. It usually comes in videos that are clearly about information technology and the right to your information and data. The host (Karl) also does a lot of old west vignettes of shootouts and history and did an Underground Railroad series recently. He also posts videos of matches which are neat to see how guns work under stress and difficult situations. 
 I thoroughly recommend this channel. 

[GarandThumb](https://www.youtube.com/user/BritishTang). The flannel daddy. No nonsense serious information with a few jokes tucked in. 

[Paul Harrell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6QH13V2o68zynSa0hZy9uQ). Papa Harrell. Zero nonsense practical reviews of guns. Plus some good reviews of famous shootouts. I recommend the Miami Dade video. 

[British Muzzleloaders](https://www.youtube.com/user/britishmuzzleloaders). Viciously mustachioed videos on historic British firearms. From the 1700s to 1900s, with a mountain of historical information as well as reloading information. I also thoroughly recommend this one. 

Getting into the more political side of channels:

[Military Arms Channel.](https://www.youtube.com/user/Sturmgewehre) He’s been around for a while but he is outspoken and political, so that might be a turnoff for some. Relatively informative and he focuses on modern firearms.

[IraqVeteran8888](https://www.youtube.com/user/Iraqveteran8888). These guys will get political but you can usually avoid that just by not watching their gun gripes episodes if you don’t want to see that. But those are also good to see what gun laws really are and how it affects people day to day. So if you’re willing to stick your toe in, those gun gripes episodes might give you some insight you didn’t have before. Otherwise their shooting videos are good, their reloading videos are great to go down a rabbit hole, and their melt down videos are interesting. 

As far as gun laws and gun policy, that’s tough. I’d encourage you to research on your own because that’s the only way you won’t get someone feeding you their own bias. Obviously these people lean one way but I think if you can stomach some of IV8888’s gripe videos you’ll get a decent crash course in the reality of gun laws.

Oh, and, it was actually all of us that caused global climate change with our emissions, so you are going to have to stop consuming to pay for all of the consuming that we did, even though we made you pay for our consuming in the first place with your labor and resources, so yeah.""

Dead towns are dead.

" &gt; You Must Tell USCIS About Changes in Each H-1B Worker's Employment Status


&gt; &gt; Employers are under an ongoing obligation to inform USCIS of any “material changes” in an H-1B worker’s employment. Unfortunately, immigration law does not define “material change.”

&gt; &gt; Any number of changes could be seen as material, such as changes in a worker’s job duties, job location, or position in the company hierarchy. Use your best judgment and consider consulting an immigration attorney when deciding whether or not a change is “material.”

&gt; &gt; If a material change occurs, you must advise USCIS by filing an amended I-129 petition. The amended I-129 should contain all the documents that the original I-129 did, plus an explanation of the change and the reason for it.

Selective fire is defined as a weapon, which at the user’s selection, can fire semi-automatic or full-automatic fire. Semi-automtic is defined as a weapon designed to fire each time the trigger is pulled. Full automatic is defined as a weapon which will fire continuously as long as the trigger is pulled.""

"Nobody is playing ""a different game"" when it comes to money and finances. There are only different ways society manipulate the game. 

The foundation of all economics is pure and basic math. Average chinese workers cannot afford homes equivalent to american prices while making 1/10th the income, no moreso than the average nigerian or mexican could, this is basic math. 

And no stretching mortgages to 70 years or 100 years does not solve the problem. No adult of working age can afford that mortgage because average person does not live to be 100 and even if they do they certainly are not producing the type of income at 100 compared to what they are getting in their 30s. What you are sayjng is basically bad debt that is kicked down the line for a future explosion. That is not a healthy economic model nor does it ""work"". 

The numbers simply dont back up what you are saying despite you repeating what the chinese govt would do. The houses are overpriced and will adjust to real prices. The only true point to this is who the chinese govt will decide to fuck over with devalued properties. The developers or the citizens. ",news

"I agree with your sentiment, but don't pretend like the Democrats don't put their party before country just as much. Social Media has decided that the Democrats are ""right"" so they get a pass for a ton of shit, but they most certainly put their party before their country. They literally stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders, despite what the country wanted. 

In 2006, they passed the Secure Fence Act which put up fences along the border, pretty much Trumps wall except trump wants it to be concrete instead of a fence and a little taller. The Democrats in the Senate also voted for this act, including Barack Obama, Hilary Clinton, and Chuck Schumer. Now I'm not saying that all of the Democrats wanted a wall or anything, but before Trump came and said he was going to build a wall, plenty of Democrats were perfectly fine with building them. Once party lines got involved and one side promised it, suddenly the wall is immoral.

The republicans obviously put their party before their country, (more importantly putting their pockets before their country), but the democrats do the exact same just as much.",news

If you want to be a loyal, obedient follower then that is one thing, but if you want to debate with educated people then you need to leave you protective security bubble that tells you Trump is always right and learn the reality of the situation. 

Our president is solely responsible for this shutdown. He started this in 2018 when he still had a Republican House. He refused to sign any CR that didn’t give him what he personally wanted. Our government is not architected to cater to only the president’s desires. The fact that his own party in congress didn’t give him what he wanted is a testimony to what the people of this country want. The majority of representatives don’t support shutting down the government for a wall, yet Trump doesn’t care about that. It’s only about what he wants. ",news
